of, 1
February,, 1
1815,, 1

Notre-Dame, 1

signalled, 1
the, 1
three-master,, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
from, 1
Smyrna,, 1
Trieste,, 1
and, 1
Naples., 1
As, 1
usual,, 1
a, 1
pilot, 1
put, 1
off, 1
immediately,, 1
and, 1
rounding, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
got, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
between, 1
Cape, 1
Morgion, 1
and, 1
Rion, 1
island., 1
Immediately,, 1
and, 1
according, 1
to, 1
custom,, 1
the, 1
ramparts, 1
of, 1
Fort, 1
Saint-Jean, 1
were, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
spectators;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
always, 1
an, 1
event, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
for, 1
a, 1
ship, 1
to, 1
come, 1
into, 1
port,, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
this, 1
ship,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
has, 1
been, 1
built,, 1
rigged,, 1
and, 1
laden, 1
at, 1
the, 1
old, 1
Phocee, 1
docks,, 1
and, 1
belongs, 1
to, 1
an, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
city., 1
The, 1
ship, 1
drew, 1
on, 1
and, 1
had, 1
safely, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
strait,, 1
which, 1
some, 1
volcanic, 1
shock, 1
has, 1
made, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Calasareigne, 1
and, 1
Jaros, 1
islands;, 1
had, 1
doubled, 1
Pomegue,, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
harbor, 1
under, 1
topsails,, 1
jib,, 1
and, 1
spanker,, 1
but, 1
so, 1
slowly, 1
and, 1
sedately, 1
that, 1
the, 1
idlers,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
instinct, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
forerunner, 1
of, 1
evil,, 1
asked, 1
one, 1
another, 1
what, 1
misfortune, 1
could, 1
have, 1
happened, 1
on, 1
board., 1
However,, 1
those, 1
experienced, 1
in, 1
navigation, 1
saw, 1
plainly, 1
that, 1
if, 1
any, 1
accident, 1
had, 1
occurred,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
herself,, 1
for, 1
she, 1
bore, 1
down, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
being, 1
skilfully, 1
handled,, 1
the, 1
anchor, 1
a-cockbill,, 1
the, 1
jib-boom, 1
guys, 1
already, 1
eased, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
standing, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pilot,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
steering, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
narrow, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inner, 1
port,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
activity, 1
and, 1
vigilant, 1
eye,, 1
watched, 1
every, 1
motion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ship,, 1
and, 1
repeated, 1
each, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pilot., 1
The, 1
vague, 1
disquietude, 1
which, 1
prevailed, 1
among, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
had, 1
so, 1
much, 1
affected, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
that, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
await, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
in, 1
harbor,, 1
but, 1
jumping, 1
into, 1
a, 1
small, 1
skiff,, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
be, 1
pulled, 1
alongside, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
as, 1
she, 1
rounded, 1
into, 1
La, 1
Reserve, 1
basin., 1
When, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
on, 1
board, 1
saw, 1
this, 1
person, 1
approach,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his, 1
station, 1
by, 1
the, 1
pilot,, 1
and,, 1
hat, 1
in, 1
hand,, 1
leaned, 1
over, 1
the, 1
ship's, 1
bulwarks., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
fine,, 1
tall,, 1
slim, 1
young, 1
fellow, 1
of, 1
eighteen, 1
or, 1
twenty,, 1
with, 1
black, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
hair, 1
as, 1
dark, 1
as, 1
a, 1
raven's, 1
wing;, 1
and, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
appearance, 1
bespoke, 1
that, 1
calmness, 1
and, 1
resolution, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
men, 1
accustomed, 1
from, 1
their, 1
cradle, 1
to, 1
contend, 1
with, 1
danger., 1
"Ah,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you,, 1
Dantes?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
skiff., 1
"What's, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
and, 1
why, 1
have, 1
you, 1
such, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1
aboard?", 1
"A, 1
great, 1
misfortune,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,--"a, 1
great, 1
misfortune,, 1
for, 1
me, 1
especially!, 1
Off, 1
Civita, 1
Vecchia, 1
we, 1
lost, 1
our, 1
brave, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
cargo?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
eagerly., 1
"Is, 1
all, 1
safe,, 1
M., 1
Morrel;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
satisfied, 1
on, 1
that, 1
head., 1
But, 1
poor, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere--", 1
"What, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
considerable, 1
resignation., 1
"What, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
captain?", 1
"He, 1
died.", 1
"Fell, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea?", 1
"No,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
died, 1
of, 1
brain-fever, 1
in, 1
dreadful, 1
agony.", 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Bear, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
there,, 1
to, 1
take, 1
in, 1
sail!", 1
All, 1
hands, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
once, 1
the, 1
eight, 1
or, 1
ten, 1
seamen, 1
who, 1
composed, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
sprang, 1
to, 1
their, 1
respective, 1
stations, 1
at, 1
the, 1
spanker, 1
brails, 1
and, 1
outhaul,, 1
topsail, 1
sheets, 1
and, 1
halyards,, 1
the, 1
jib, 1
downhaul,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
topsail, 1
clewlines, 1
and, 1
buntlines., 1
The, 1
young, 1
sailor, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
look, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
his, 1
orders, 1
were, 1
promptly, 1
and, 1
accurately, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
again, 1
to, 1
the, 1
owner., 1
"And, 1
how, 1
did, 1
this, 1
misfortune, 1
occur?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
resuming, 1
the, 1
interrupted, 1
conversation., 1
"Alas,, 1
sir,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
unexpected, 1
manner., 1
After, 1
a, 1
long, 1
talk, 1
with, 1
the, 1
harbor-master,, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
left, 1
Naples, 1
greatly, 1
disturbed, 1
in, 1
mind., 1
In, 1
twenty-four, 1
hours, 1
he, 1
was, 1
attacked, 1
by, 1
a, 1
fever,, 1
and, 1
died, 1
three, 1
days, 1
afterwards., 1
We, 1
performed, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
burial, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
at, 1
his, 1
rest,, 1
sewn, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hammock, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thirty-six, 1
pound, 1
shot, 1
at, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
his, 1
heels,, 1
off, 1
El, 1
Giglio, 1
island., 1
We, 1
bring, 1
to, 1
his, 1
widow, 1
his, 1
sword, 1
and, 1
cross, 1
of, 1
honor., 1
It, 1
was, 1
worth, 1
while,, 1
truly,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
smile,, 1
"to, 1
make, 1
war, 1
against, 1
the, 1
English, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
years,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
die, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
at, 1
last,, 1
like, 1
everybody, 1
else.", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
Edmond,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
more, 1
comforted, 1
at, 1
every, 1
moment,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
all, 1
mortal,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
must, 1
make, 1
way, 1
for, 1
the, 1
young., 1
If, 1
not,, 1
why,, 1
there, 1
would, 1
be, 1
no, 1
promotion;, 1
and, 1
since, 1
you, 1
assure, 1
me, 1
that, 1
the, 1
cargo--", 1
"Is, 1
all, 1
safe, 1
and, 1
sound,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
take, 1
my, 1
word, 1
for, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
advise, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
take, 1
25,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
the, 1
profits, 1
of, 1
the, 1
voyage.", 1
Then,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
just, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
Round, 1
Tower,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
shouted:, 1
"Stand, 1
by, 1
there, 1
to, 1
lower, 1
the, 1
topsails, 1
and, 1
jib;, 1
brail, 1
up, 1
the, 1
spanker!", 1
The, 1
order, 1
was, 1
executed, 1
as, 1
promptly, 1
as, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
on, 1
board, 1
a, 1
man-of-war., 1
"Let, 1
go--and, 1
clue, 1
up!", 1
At, 1
this, 1
last, 1
command, 1
all, 1
the, 1
sails, 1
were, 1
lowered,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
moved, 1
almost, 1
imperceptibly, 1
onwards., 1
"Now,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
come, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
observing, 1
the, 1
owner's, 1
impatience,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
your, 1
supercargo,, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
coming, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cabin,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
furnish, 1
you, 1
with, 1
every, 1
particular., 1
As, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
look, 1
after, 1
the, 1
anchoring,, 1
and, 1
dress, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
in, 1
mourning.", 1
The, 1
owner, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
a, 1
second, 1
invitation., 1
He, 1
seized, 1
a, 1
rope, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
flung, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
activity, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
credit, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sailor,, 1
climbed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ship,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
going, 1
to, 1
his, 1
task,, 1
left, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
now, 1
came, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
owner., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
twenty-five, 1
or, 1
twenty-six, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
of, 1
unprepossessing, 1
countenance,, 1
obsequious, 1
to, 1
his, 1
superiors,, 1
insolent, 1
to, 1
his, 1
subordinates;, 1
and, 1
this,, 1
in, 1
addition, 1
to, 1
his, 1
position, 1
as, 1
responsible, 1
agent, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
always, 1
obnoxious, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
made, 1
him, 1
as, 1
much, 1
disliked, 1
by, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
as, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
beloved, 1
by, 1
them., 1
"Well,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
that, 1
has, 1
befallen, 1
us?", 1
"Yes--yes:, 1
poor, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere!, 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
brave, 1
and, 1
an, 1
honest, 1
man.", 1
"And, 1
a, 1
first-rate, 1
seaman,, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
long, 1
and, 1
honorable, 1
service,, 1
as, 1
became, 1
a, 1
man, 1
charged, 1
with, 1
the, 1
interests, 1
of, 1
a, 1
house, 1
so, 1
important, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars., 1
"But,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
glancing, 1
after, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
anchoring, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vessel,, 1
"it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
needs, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
old, 1
as, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
Danglars,, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
his, 1
business,, 1
for, 1
our, 1
friend, 1
Edmond, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
it, 1
thoroughly,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
to, 1
require, 1
instruction, 1
from, 1
any, 1
one.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
darting, 1
at, 1
Edmond, 1
a, 1
look, 1
gleaming, 1
with, 1
hate., 1
"Yes,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
young,, 1
and, 1
youth, 1
is, 1
invariably, 1
self-confident., 1
Scarcely, 1
was, 1
the, 1
captain's, 1
breath, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
body, 1
when, 1
he, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
command, 1
without, 1
consulting, 1
any, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
caused, 1
us, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
day, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
making, 1
for, 1
Marseilles, 1
direct.", 1
"As, 1
to, 1
taking, 1
command, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vessel,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel,, 1
"that, 1
was, 1
his, 1
duty, 1
as, 1
captain's, 1
mate;, 1
as, 1
to, 1
losing, 1
a, 1
day, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
off, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
wrong,, 1
unless, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
needed, 1
repairs.", 1
"The, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
in, 1
as, 1
good, 1
condition, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
and, 1
as,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
day, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
from, 1
pure, 1
whim,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
going, 1
ashore,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
else.", 1
"Dantes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
shipowner,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"come, 1
this, 1
way!", 1
"In, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
sir,", 1
answered, 1
Dantes,, 1
"and, 1
I'm, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
Then, 1
calling, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
he, 1
said--"Let, 1
go!", 1
The, 1
anchor, 1
was, 1
instantly, 1
dropped,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
chain, 1
ran, 1
rattling, 1
through, 1
the, 1
port-hole., 1
Dantes, 1
continued, 1
at, 1
his, 1
post, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pilot,, 1
until, 1
this, 1
manoeuvre, 1
was, 1
completed,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"Half-mast, 1
the, 1
colors,, 1
and, 1
square, 1
the, 1
yards!", 1
"You, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"he, 1
fancies, 1
himself, 1
captain, 1
already,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
word.", 1
"And, 1
so,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
he, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
owner., 1
"Except, 1
your, 1
signature, 1
and, 1
your, 1
partner's,, 1
M., 1
Morrel.", 1
"And, 1
why, 1
should, 1
he, 1
not, 1
have, 1
this?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
owner;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
young,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
a, 1
thorough, 1
seaman,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
full, 1
experience.", 1
A, 1
cloud, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
Danglars', 1
brow., 1
"Your, 1
pardon,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
approaching,, 1
"the, 1
vessel, 1
now, 1
rides, 1
at, 1
anchor,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service., 1
You, 1
hailed, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
Danglars, 1
retreated, 1
a, 1
step, 1
or, 1
two., 1
"I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
why, 1
you, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
sir;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
the, 1
last, 1
instructions, 1
of, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere,, 1
who,, 1
when, 1
dying,, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
for, 1
Marshal, 1
Bertrand.", 1
"Then, 1
did, 1
you, 1
see, 1
him,, 1
Edmond?", 1
"Who?", 1
"The, 1
marshal.", 1
"Yes.", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
drawing, 1
Dantes, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
suddenly--"And, 1
how, 1
is, 1
the, 1
emperor?", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
I, 1
could, 1
judge, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him.", 1
"You, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
emperor,, 1
then?", 1
"He, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
marshal's, 1
apartment, 1
while, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
"Why,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
he, 1
say, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Asked, 1
me, 1
questions, 1
about, 1
the, 1
vessel,, 1
the, 1
time, 1
she, 1
left, 1
Marseilles,, 1
the, 1
course, 1
she, 1
had, 1
taken,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
was, 1
her, 1
cargo., 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
if, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
laden,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
her, 1
master,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
bought, 1
her., 1
But, 1
I, 1
told, 1
him, 1
I, 1
was, 1
only, 1
mate,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
the, 1
firm, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son., 1
'Ah,, 1
yes,', 1
he, 1
said,, 1
'I, 1
know, 1
them., 1
The, 1
Morrels, 1
have, 1
been, 1
shipowners, 1
from, 1
father, 1
to, 1
son;, 1
and, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Morrel, 1
who, 1
served, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
regiment, 1
with, 1
me, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
garrison, 1
at, 1
Valence.'", 1
"Pardieu,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
true!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
greatly, 1
delighted., 1
"And, 1
that, 1
was, 1
Policar, 1
Morrel,, 1
my, 1
uncle,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
afterwards, 1
a, 1
captain., 1
Dantes,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
tell, 1
my, 1
uncle, 1
that, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
remembered, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
it, 1
will, 1
bring, 1
tears, 1
into, 1
the, 1
old, 1
soldier's, 1
eyes., 1
Come,, 1
come,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
patting, 1
Edmond's, 1
shoulder, 1
kindly,, 1
"you, 1
did, 1
very, 1
right,, 1
Dantes,, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere's, 1
instructions,, 1
and, 1
touch, 1
at, 1
Elba,, 1
although, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
known, 1
that, 1
you, 1
had, 1
conveyed, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
to, 1
the, 1
marshal,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
conversed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
emperor,, 1
it, 1
might, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
into, 1
trouble.", 1
"How, 1
could, 1
that, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
into, 1
trouble,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes;, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
know, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
was, 1
the, 1
bearer;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
merely, 1
made, 1
such, 1
inquiries, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
comer., 1
But,, 1
pardon, 1
me,, 1
here, 1
are, 1
the, 1
health, 1
officers, 1
and, 1
the, 1
customs, 1
inspectors, 1
coming, 1
alongside.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gangway., 1
As, 1
he, 1
departed,, 1
Danglars, 1
approached,, 1
and, 1
said,--, 1
"Well,, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
given, 1
you, 1
satisfactory, 1
reasons, 1
for, 1
his, 1
landing, 1
at, 1
Porto-Ferrajo?", 1
"Yes,, 1
most, 1
satisfactory,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Danglars.", 1
"Well,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
supercargo;, 1
"for, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
pleasant, 1
to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
a, 1
comrade, 1
has, 1
not, 1
done, 1
his, 1
duty.", 1
"Dantes, 1
has, 1
done, 1
his,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
saying, 1
much., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
orders, 1
for, 1
this, 1
delay.", 1
"Talking, 1
of, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere,, 1
has, 1
not, 1
Dantes, 1
given, 1
you, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
him?", 1
"To, 1
me?--no--was, 1
there, 1
one?", 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
that,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
packet,, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
confided, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
his, 1
care.", 1
"Of, 1
what, 1
packet, 1
are, 1
you, 1
speaking,, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Why,, 1
that, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
left, 1
at, 1
Porto-Ferrajo.", 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
at, 1
Porto-Ferrajo?", 1
Danglars, 1
turned, 1
very, 1
red., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
captain's, 1
cabin,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
half, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
give, 1
the, 1
packet, 1
and, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
Dantes.", 1
"He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
shipowner;, 1
"but, 1
if, 1
there, 1
be, 1
any, 1
letter, 1
he, 1
will, 1
give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Danglars, 1
reflected, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"Then,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"not, 1
to, 1
say, 1
a, 1
word, 1
to, 1
Dantes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
I, 1
may, 1
have, 1
been, 1
mistaken.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
returned;, 1
Danglars, 1
withdrew., 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Dantes,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
now, 1
free?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
owner., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
long, 1
detained.", 1
"No., 1
I, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
custom-house, 1
officers, 1
a, 1
copy, 1
of, 1
our, 1
bill, 1
of, 1
lading;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
papers,, 1
they, 1
sent, 1
a, 1
man, 1
off, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pilot,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
gave, 1
them.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
here?", 1
"No--everything, 1
is, 1
all, 1
right, 1
now.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
can, 1
come, 1
and, 1
dine, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
really, 1
must, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1
me,, 1
M., 1
Morrel., 1
My, 1
first, 1
visit, 1
is, 1
due, 1
to, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
though, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
the, 1
less, 1
grateful, 1
for, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
me.", 1
"Right,, 1
Dantes,, 1
quite, 1
right., 1
I, 1
always, 1
knew, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
good, 1
son.", 1
"And,", 1
inquired, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
some, 1
hesitation,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
how, 1
my, 1
father, 1
is?", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Edmond,, 1
though, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
lately.", 1
"Yes,, 1
he, 1
likes, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
himself, 1
shut, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
little, 1
room.", 1
"That, 1
proves,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
wanted, 1
for, 1
nothing, 1
during, 1
your, 1
absence.", 1
Dantes, 1
smiled., 1
"My, 1
father, 1
is, 1
proud,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
a, 1
meal, 1
left,, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
if, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
asked, 1
anything, 1
from, 1
anyone,, 1
except, 1
from, 1
Heaven.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
after, 1
this, 1
first, 1
visit, 1
has, 1
been, 1
made, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
count, 1
on, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
must, 1
again, 1
excuse, 1
myself,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
for, 1
after, 1
this, 1
first, 1
visit, 1
has, 1
been, 1
paid, 1
I, 1
have, 1
another, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
most, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
pay.", 1
"True,, 1
Dantes,, 1
I, 1
forgot, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
some, 1
one, 1
who, 1
expects, 1
you, 1
no, 1
less, 1
impatiently, 1
than, 1
your, 1
father--the, 1
lovely, 1
Mercedes.", 1
Dantes, 1
blushed., 1
"Ah,, 1
ha,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
shipowner,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
surprised,, 1

she, 1
has, 1
been, 1
to, 1
me, 1
three, 1

exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
seaman,, 1
with, 1
tears, 1
in, 1

grasping, 1

row, 1
you, 1
ashore?", 1

he, 1
a, 1
good, 1
comrade?, 1
No,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
think, 1

was, 1

into, 1

sat, 1
down, 1
in, 1

bent, 1
to, 1

away, 1

d'Orleans., 1
The, 1
shipowner,, 1
smiling,, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
until, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
spring, 1
out, 1
on, 1
the, 1
quay, 1
and, 1
disappear, 1
in, 1

street, 1

character, 1
to, 1

On, 1
turning, 1
round, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
saw, 1
Danglars, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
apparently, 1
awaiting, 1
orders,, 1

in, 1
reality, 1
also, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
young, 1
sailor,--but, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
difference, 1
in, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men, 1

will, 1
leave, 1
Danglars, 1
struggling, 1
with, 1
the, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
hatred,, 1

endeavoring, 1
to, 1
insinuate, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ear, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shipowner, 1
some, 1
evil, 1
suspicions, 1
against, 1
his, 1
comrade,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
Dantes,, 1
who,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
traversed, 1
La, 1
Canebiere,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Noailles,, 1
and, 1
entering, 1
a, 1
small, 1
house,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
rapidly, 1
ascended, 1
four, 1
flights, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
staircase,, 1
holding, 1
the, 1
baluster, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
he, 1
repressed, 1
the, 1
beatings, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
paused, 1
before, 1
a, 1
half-open, 1
door,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
room., 1
This, 1
room, 1
was, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
Dantes', 1
father., 1
The, 1
news, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
who,, 1
mounted, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
was, 1
amusing, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
training, 1
with, 1
trembling, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
nasturtiums, 1
and, 1
sprays, 1
of, 1
clematis, 1
that, 1
clambered, 1
over, 1
the, 1
trellis, 1
at, 1
his, 1
window., 1
Suddenly,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
an, 1
arm, 1
thrown, 1
around, 1
his, 1
body,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
well-known, 1
voice, 1
behind, 1
him, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"Father--dear, 1
father!", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
round;, 1
then,, 1
seeing, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling., 1
"What, 1
ails, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dearest, 1
father?, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
ill?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
much, 1
alarmed., 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Edmond--my, 1
boy--my, 1
son!--no;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
you;, 1
and, 1
joy,, 1
the, 1
surprise, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
you, 1
so, 1
suddenly--Ah,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
as, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
die.", 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
cheer, 1
up,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father!, 1
'Tis, 1
I--really, 1
I!, 1
They, 1
say, 1
joy, 1
never, 1
hurts,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
you, 1
without, 1
any, 1
warning., 1
Come, 1
now,, 1
do, 1
smile,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
me, 1
so, 1
solemnly., 1
Here, 1
I, 1
am, 1
back, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
be, 1
happy.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
my, 1
boy,, 1
so, 1
we, 1
will--so, 1
we, 1
will,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man;, 1
"but, 1
how, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
be, 1
happy?, 1
Shall, 1
you, 1
never, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
again?, 1
Come,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
all, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
that, 1
has, 1
befallen, 1
you.", 1
"God, 1
forgive, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"for, 1
rejoicing, 1
at, 1
happiness, 1
derived, 1
from, 1
the, 1
misery, 1
of, 1
others,, 1
but,, 1
Heaven, 1
knows,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
this, 1
good, 1
fortune;, 1
it, 1
has, 1
happened,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
really, 1
cannot, 1
pretend, 1
to, 1
lament, 1
it., 1
The, 1
good, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
is, 1
dead,, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
probable, 1
that,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
his, 1
place., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
understand,, 1
father?, 1
Only, 1
imagine, 1
me, 1
a, 1
captain, 1
at, 1
twenty,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
louis, 1
pay,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
share, 1
in, 1
the, 1
profits!, 1
Is, 1
this, 1
not, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
sailor, 1
like, 1
me, 1
could, 1
have, 1
hoped, 1
for?", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
boy,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
fortunate.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
first, 1
money, 1
I, 1
touch,, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
you, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
small, 1
house,, 1

a, 1
garden, 1
in, 1

plant, 1
clematis,, 1
nasturtiums,, 1

honeysuckle., 1

what, 1
ails, 1
you,, 1
father?, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
well?", 1
"'Tis, 1
nothing,, 1
nothing;, 1
it, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
pass, 1
away"--and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said, 1
so, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
strength, 1
failed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
backwards., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine,, 1
father,, 1
will, 1
revive, 1
you., 1

do, 1
you, 1
keep, 1
your, 1

"No,, 1
no;, 1

You, 1
need, 1
not, 1
look, 1
for, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
father,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
where, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
and, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
cupboards., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
no, 1
use,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
wine.", 1
"What,, 1
no, 1
wine?", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
turning, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
alternately, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hollow, 1
cheeks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
and, 1
the, 1
empty, 1
cupboards., 1
"What,, 1
no, 1
wine?, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
wanted, 1
money,, 1
father?", 1
"I, 1
want, 1
nothing, 1
now, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Yet,", 1
stammered, 1
Dantes,, 1
wiping, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brow,--"yet, 1
I, 1
gave, 1
you, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
when, 1
I, 1
left,, 1
three, 1
months, 1
ago.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
Edmond,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
true,, 1

you, 1
forgot, 1
at, 1
that, 1
time, 1
a, 1
little, 1
debt, 1
to, 1
our, 1
neighbor,, 1
Caderousse., 1

reminded, 1
me, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
telling, 1
me, 1

I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
pay, 1
for, 1

would, 1
be, 1
paid, 1
by, 1

so,, 1
you, 1

he, 1
might, 1
do, 1
you, 1
an, 1
injury"--, 1
"Well?", 1
"Why,, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
him.", 1
"But,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1

forty, 1
francs, 1

owed, 1
Caderousse.", 1
"Yes,", 1
stammered, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
paid, 1
him, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
I, 1
left, 1
you?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
nodded., 1
"So, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
lived, 1
for, 1
three, 1
months, 1
on, 1
sixty, 1
francs,", 1
muttered, 1
Edmond., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
how, 1
little, 1
I, 1
require,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Heaven, 1
pardon, 1
me,", 1
cried, 1
Edmond,, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
before, 1
his, 1
father., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing?", 1
"You, 1

"Never, 1

you, 1
once, 1
more,", 1

the, 1
old, 1
man;, 1
"and, 1
now, 1
it's, 1
all, 1
over--everything, 1
is, 1
all, 1
right, 1
again.", 1
"Yes,, 1
here, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"with, 1
a, 1
promising, 1
future, 1
and, 1
a, 1
little, 1
money., 1
Here,, 1
father,, 1
here!", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"take, 1
this--take, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
send, 1
for, 1
something, 1
immediately.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
emptied, 1
his, 1
pockets, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
consisting, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
gold, 1
pieces,, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
five-franc, 1
pieces,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
smaller, 1
coin., 1
The, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
old, 1
Dantes, 1
brightened., 1
"Whom, 1
does, 1
this, 1
belong, 1
to?", 1
he, 1
inquired., 1
"To, 1
me,, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
to, 1
us!, 1
Take, 1
it;, 1
buy, 1
some, 1
provisions;, 1
be, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
to-morrow, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
more.", 1
"Gently,, 1
gently,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile;, 1
"and, 1
by, 1
your, 1
leave, 1
I, 1
will, 1
use, 1
your, 1

moderately,, 1
for, 1

saw, 1
me, 1

too, 1
many, 1
things, 1
at, 1
a, 1

I, 1
have, 1
some, 1

coffee, 1

most, 1
capital, 1

small, 1

hush,, 1
here, 1
comes, 1
somebody.", 1
"'Tis, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
your, 1

no, 1

"Ah,, 1
lips, 1
that, 1
say, 1
one, 1
thing,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
thinks, 1
another,", 1
murmured, 1
Edmond., 1
"But,, 1
never, 1
mind,, 1

is, 1
a, 1
neighbor, 1
who, 1
has, 1
done, 1
us, 1
a, 1

a, 1

As, 1
Edmond, 1
paused,, 1
the, 1
black, 1
and, 1
bearded, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Caderousse, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
twenty-five, 1
or, 1
six,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
cloth,, 1
which,, 1
being, 1
a, 1
tailor,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1

into, 1
a, 1
coat-lining., 1
"What,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you,, 1
Edmond,, 1
back, 1
again?", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
broad, 1
Marseillaise, 1
accent,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
grin, 1
that, 1
displayed, 1
his, 1
ivory-white, 1
teeth., 1
"Yes,, 1
as, 1
you, 1

ready, 1
to, 1
be, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
you, 1
in, 1
any, 1

replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
but, 1
ill-concealing, 1
his, 1
coldness, 1
under, 1
this, 1
cloak, 1
of, 1
civility., 1
"Thanks--thanks;, 1

fortunately,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

for, 1
anything;, 1

are, 1

gesture., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

to, 1
you,, 1

No!--no!, 1
I, 1
lent, 1
you, 1
money,, 1

you, 1

"We, 1
are, 1
never, 1
quits, 1
with, 1

who, 1

Dantes', 1

when, 1
we, 1

to, 1
match, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
mulberry, 1
cloth,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
met, 1
friend, 1
Danglars., 1
'You, 1
at, 1
Marseilles?'--'Yes,', 1
says, 1
he., 1
"'I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1

now, 1
back, 1
again.', 1
"'And, 1
where, 1
is, 1
the, 1

boy,, 1
our, 1
little, 1
Edmond?', 1
"'Why,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
no, 1

replied, 1
Danglars., 1
And, 1
so, 1
I, 1
came,", 1
added, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"as, 1
fast, 1
as, 1
I, 1
could, 1
to, 1

pleasure, 1
of, 1

hands, 1
with, 1
a, 1

"Worthy, 1
Caderousse!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1

is, 1

"Yes,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
I, 1
am., 1
I, 1
love, 1
and, 1
esteem, 1
you,, 1

honest, 1
folks, 1
are, 1
so, 1
rare., 1
But, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
you, 1
have, 1
come, 1
back, 1
rich,, 1
my, 1
boy,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
tailor,, 1
looking, 1
askance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
handful, 1
of, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
silver, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
remarked, 1
the, 1
greedy, 1
glance, 1
which, 1
shone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
neighbor., 1
"Eh,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
negligently,, 1
"this, 1
money, 1
is, 1
not, 1
mine., 1
I, 1
was, 1
expressing, 1
to, 1
my, 1

emptied, 1
his, 1
purse, 1

father", 1
added, 1
Dantes,, 1
"put, 1
this, 1
money, 1
back, 1
in, 1
your, 1

wants, 1
anything,, 1

is, 1
at, 1

"No,, 1
my, 1

no,", 1

Caderousse., 1
"I, 1

your, 1
money--keep, 1
it,, 1

too, 1
much;--but,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
my, 1
boy,, 1

took, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
offered, 1
with, 1
good, 1
will,", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"No, 1
doubt,, 1
my, 1
boy;, 1
no, 1
doubt., 1
Well,, 1
you, 1
stand, 1
well, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
I, 1
hear,--you, 1
insinuating, 1
dog,, 1
you!", 1
"M., 1
Morrel, 1
has, 1
always, 1
been, 1
exceedingly, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
were, 1
wrong, 1
to, 1
refuse, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
with, 1
him.", 1
"What,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
with, 1
him?", 1
said, 1
old, 1
Dantes;, 1
"and, 1
did, 1
he, 1
invite, 1
you, 1
to, 1
dine?", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,", 1
replied, 1
Edmond,, 1
smiling, 1
at, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
excessive, 1
honor, 1
paid, 1
to, 1
his, 1
son., 1
"And, 1
why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
refuse,, 1
my, 1
son?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"That, 1
I, 1
might, 1
the, 1
sooner, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
most, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you.", 1
"But, 1
it, 1
must, 1
have, 1
vexed, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
good,, 1
worthy, 1
man,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"And, 1
when, 1
you, 1
are, 1
looking, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
be, 1
captain,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
wrong, 1
to, 1
annoy, 1
the, 1
owner.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
refusal,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
he, 1
fully, 1
understood, 1
it.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
be, 1
captain, 1
one, 1
must, 1
do, 1
a, 1
little, 1
flattery, 1
to, 1
one's, 1
patrons.", 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
to, 1
be, 1
captain, 1
without, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better--so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better!, 1
Nothing, 1
will, 1
give, 1
greater, 1
pleasure, 1
to, 1

down, 1
there, 1
behind, 1

it.", 1
"Mercedes?", 1

the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,, 1

pay, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Catalans.", 1
"Go,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
boy,", 1

old, 1
Dantes:, 1

heaven, 1
bless, 1
you, 1

Caderousse;, 1
"why,, 1

is, 1
not, 1

"So,, 1

according, 1
to, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
she, 1
soon, 1
will, 1
be,", 1
replied, 1
Edmond., 1
"Yes--yes,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
were, 1
right, 1
to, 1
return, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
my, 1
boy.", 1
"And, 1
why?", 1
"Because, 1
Mercedes, 1
is, 1
a, 1
very, 1
fine, 1
girl,, 1
and, 1
fine, 1
girls, 1
never, 1
lack, 1
followers;, 1
she, 1
particularly, 1
has, 1
them, 1
by, 1
dozens.", 1
"Really?", 1
answered, 1
Edmond,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
which, 1
had, 1
in, 1
it, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
slight, 1
uneasiness., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"and, 1
capital, 1
offers,, 1
too;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
captain,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
could, 1
refuse, 1
you, 1
then?", 1
"Meaning, 1
to, 1
say,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
which, 1
but, 1
ill-concealed, 1
his, 1
trouble,, 1
"that, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
not, 1
a, 1
captain"--, 1
"Eh--eh!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
sailor,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
better, 1

than, 1
you, 1
of, 1

better--so, 1

Caderousse., 1

is, 1

Edmond's, 1

embracing, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
nodding, 1
to, 1
Caderousse,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
Caderousse, 1
lingered, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
then, 1
taking, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
old, 1
Dantes,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
downstairs, 1
to, 1
rejoin, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
awaited, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Senac., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
see, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
left, 1
him,", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Did, 1
he, 1
allude, 1
to, 1
his, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
being, 1
captain?", 1
"He, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
already, 1
decided.", 1
"Indeed!", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
in, 1
too, 1
much, 1
hurry,, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"Why,, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
has, 1
promised, 1
him, 1
the, 1
thing.", 1
"So, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
elated, 1
about, 1
it?", 1
"Why,, 1
yes,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
actually, 1
insolent, 1
over, 1
the, 1
matter--has, 1
already, 1
offered, 1

proffered, 1
me, 1
a, 1
loan, 1
of, 1
money,, 1

he, 1
were, 1
a, 1
banker.", 1
"Which, 1
you, 1
refused?", 1
"Most, 1
assuredly;, 1
although, 1
I, 1
might, 1
easily, 1
have, 1
accepted, 1
it,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
I, 1
who, 1
put, 1
into, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
the, 1
first, 1
silver, 1
he, 1
ever, 1
earned;, 1

now, 1
M., 1
Dantes, 1
has, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
occasion, 1
for, 1
assistance--he, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
become, 1
a, 1
captain.", 1

Danglars,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
one, 1

foi,, 1

will, 1

he, 1
should, 1

will, 1
be, 1
really, 1
no, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"If, 1
we, 1
choose,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1

will, 1
remain, 1
what, 1
he, 1

perhaps, 1
become, 1
even, 1
less, 1
than, 1
he, 1

"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"Nothing--I, 1
was, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
myself., 1

is, 1
he, 1
still, 1
in, 1
love, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Catalane?", 1

head, 1

ears;, 1

unless, 1
I, 1
am, 1
much, 1
mistaken,, 1

will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
storm, 1
in, 1
that, 1
quarter.", 1

yourself.", 1
"Why, 1
should, 1
I?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
more, 1
important, 1
than, 1
you, 1
think,, 1

You, 1
do, 1
not, 1

tell, 1
me, 1

about, 1

things, 1

you, 1
think, 1
this, 1

pays, 1
her, 1
attentions?", 1
"I, 1
only, 1
suppose, 1
so., 1

else, 1
can, 1
a, 1
strapping, 1
chap, 1
of, 1
twenty-one, 1

with, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
wench, 1
of, 1
seventeen?", 1

you, 1

that, 1

gone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Catalans?", 1

went, 1
before, 1

came, 1
down.", 1

us, 1
go, 1
the, 1
same, 1
way;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
stop, 1
at, 1

ten, 1
minutes, 1

assured, 1
that, 1

down, 1
under, 1

the, 1
two, 1

Long, 1

an, 1
unknown, 1
tongue., 1
One, 1
of, 1
its, 1
chiefs,, 1
who, 1
understood, 1
Provencal,, 1
begged, 1
the, 1
commune, 1
of, 1
Marseilles, 1
to, 1
give, 1
them, 1
this, 1
bare, 1
and, 1
barren, 1
promontory,, 1
where,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
of, 1
old,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
run, 1
their, 1
boats, 1
ashore., 1

with, 1
her, 1
back, 1
against, 1

wainscot,, 1
rubbing, 1

bunch, 1
of, 1
heath, 1

Arlesian, 1

moved, 1
with, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1

she, 1
tapped, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
with, 1
her, 1
arched, 1
and, 1
supple, 1
foot,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
display, 1
the, 1
pure, 1
and, 1
full, 1
shape, 1
of, 1
her, 1
well-turned, 1
leg,, 1
in, 1
its, 1
red, 1
cotton,, 1
gray, 1
and, 1
blue, 1
clocked,, 1
stocking., 1
At, 1
three, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
her,, 1
seated, 1
in, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
which, 1
he, 1
balanced, 1
on, 1
two, 1
legs,, 1
leaning, 1
his, 1
elbow, 1
on, 1
an, 1
old, 1
worm-eaten, 1
table,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tall, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
twenty,, 1
or, 1
two-and-twenty,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
in, 1
which, 1
vexation, 1
and, 1
uneasiness, 1
were, 1
mingled., 1
He, 1
questioned, 1
her, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
steady, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
controlled, 1
his, 1
look., 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
Mercedes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
Easter, 1

round, 1
again;, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
is, 1
this, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
a, 1
wedding?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
answered, 1
you, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times,, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
really, 1
you, 1
must, 1
be, 1
very, 1
stupid, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
again.", 1
"Well,, 1
repeat, 1
it,--repeat, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
at, 1
last, 1
believe, 1
it!, 1
Tell, 1
me, 1
for, 1
the, 1
hundredth, 1
time, 1
that, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
my, 1
love,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
your, 1
mother's, 1
sanction., 1
Make, 1
me, 1
understand, 1
once, 1
for, 1
all, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
trifling, 1
with, 1
my, 1
happiness,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
life, 1
or, 1
death, 1
are, 1
nothing, 1

you., 1
Ah,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
dreamed, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
being, 1
your, 1

to, 1
lose, 1
that, 1
hope,, 1
which, 1
was, 1

only, 1
stay, 1
of, 1
my, 1
existence!", 1
"At, 1
least, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
I, 1
who, 1
ever, 1
encouraged, 1
you, 1
in, 1
that, 1
hope,, 1
Fernand,", 1
replied, 1
Mercedes;, 1
"you, 1
cannot, 1
reproach, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
coquetry., 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
said, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

do, 1

ask, 1
from, 1
me, 1
more, 1
than, 1

another's.', 1
Is, 1
not, 1
this, 1
true,, 1
Fernand?", 1
"Yes,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
very, 1
true,, 1

the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
cruelly, 1
frank, 1
with, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
do, 1
you, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
among, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
a, 1
sacred, 1
law, 1
to, 1
intermarry?", 1
"You, 1
mistake,, 1
Fernand;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
law,, 1
but, 1
merely, 1
a, 1
custom,, 1
and,, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
cite, 1
this, 1
custom, 1
in, 1
your, 1
favor., 1
You, 1
are, 1
included, 1
in, 1
the, 1
conscription,, 1

are, 1
only, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
on, 1
sufferance,, 1

any, 1
moment, 1
to, 1

called, 1
upon, 1
to, 1
take, 1
up, 1

Once, 1
a, 1
soldier,, 1
what, 1
would, 1
you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
orphan,, 1
forlorn,, 1
without, 1
fortune,, 1
with, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
a, 1
half-ruined, 1
hut, 1
and, 1
a, 1
few, 1
ragged, 1
nets,, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
inheritance, 1
left, 1
by, 1
my, 1
father, 1

my, 1

by, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
me?, 1
She, 1
has, 1
been, 1
dead, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
Fernand,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
subsisted, 1
almost, 1
entirely, 1
on, 1
public, 1
charity., 1
Sometimes, 1
you, 1
pretend, 1
I, 1
am, 1
useful, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
to, 1
share, 1
with, 1
me, 1
the, 1
produce, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fishing,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
accept, 1
it,, 1
Fernand,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
brother,, 1
because, 1
we, 1
were, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
together,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
because, 1
it, 1
would, 1
give, 1
you, 1
so, 1
much, 1
pain, 1
if, 1
I, 1
refuse., 1
But, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
very, 1
deeply, 1
that, 1
this, 1
fish, 1
which, 1
I, 1
go, 1
and, 1
sell,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
produce, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
buy, 1
the, 1
flax, 1
I, 1
spin,--I, 1
feel, 1
very, 1
keenly,, 1
Fernand,, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
charity.", 1
"And, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were,, 1
Mercedes,, 1
poor, 1
and, 1
lone, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
you, 1
suit, 1
me, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1

and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
promise, 1
no, 1
more, 1
than, 1
I, 1
can, 1
bestow.", 1
"I, 1
understand,", 1
replied, 1
Fernand,, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
endure, 1
your, 1
own, 1
wretchedness, 1
patiently,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
are, 1
afraid, 1
to, 1
share, 1
mine., 1
Well,, 1
Mercedes,, 1
beloved, 1
by, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
tempt, 1
fortune;, 1
you, 1
would, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
good, 1
luck,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
become, 1
rich., 1
I, 1
could, 1
extend, 1
my, 1
occupation, 1
as, 1
a, 1
fisherman,, 1
might, 1
get, 1
a, 1
place, 1
as, 1
clerk, 1
in, 1
a, 1
warehouse,, 1
and, 1
become, 1
in, 1
time, 1
a, 1
dealer, 1
myself.", 1
"You, 1
could, 1
do, 1
no, 1
such, 1
thing,, 1
Fernand;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
soldier,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
remain, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
it, 1
is, 1
because, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
war;, 1
so, 1
remain, 1
a, 1
fisherman,, 1
and, 1
contented, 1
with, 1
my, 1
friendship,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
give, 1
you, 1
more.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
better,, 1
Mercedes., 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
sailor;, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
our, 1
fathers,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
despise,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
wear, 1
a, 1
varnished, 1
hat,, 1
a, 1
striped, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
jacket,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
anchor, 1
on, 1
the, 1
buttons., 1
Would, 1
not, 1
that, 1
dress, 1
please, 1
you?", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
asked, 1
Mercedes,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
angry, 1
glance,--"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
mean,, 1
Mercedes,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
thus, 1
harsh, 1
and, 1
cruel, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
expecting, 1
some, 1
one, 1
who, 1
is, 1
thus, 1
attired;, 1
but, 1
perhaps, 1
he, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
await, 1
is, 1
inconstant,, 1
or, 1
if, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not,, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
is, 1
so, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"Fernand,", 1
cried, 1
Mercedes,, 1
"I, 1
believed, 1
you, 1
were, 1
good-hearted,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
mistaken!, 1
Fernand,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
wicked, 1
to, 1
call, 1
to, 1
your, 1
aid, 1
jealousy, 1

the, 1
anger, 1
of, 1
God!, 1
Yes,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
deny, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
await,, 1

I, 1
do, 1
love, 1
him, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
speak;, 1
and,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
return,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
accusing, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inconstancy, 1
which, 1
you, 1
insinuate,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
he, 1
died, 1
loving, 1
me, 1
and, 1
me, 1
only.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
rage., 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
you,, 1
Fernand;, 1
you, 1
would, 1
be, 1
revenged, 1
on, 1
him, 1
because, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
love, 1
you;, 1
you, 1
would, 1
cross, 1
your, 1
Catalan, 1
knife, 1
with, 1
his, 1
dirk., 1
What, 1
end, 1
would, 1
that, 1
answer?, 1
To, 1
lose, 1
you, 1
my, 1
friendship, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
conquered,, 1
and, 1
see, 1
that, 1
friendship, 1
changed, 1
into, 1
hate, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
victor., 1
Believe, 1
me,, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
a, 1
quarrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
man, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
method, 1
of, 1
pleasing, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
loves, 1
that, 1
man., 1
No,, 1
Fernand,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
thus, 1
give, 1
way, 1
to, 1
evil, 1
thoughts., 1
Unable, 1
to, 1
have, 1
me, 1
for, 1
your, 1
wife,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
content, 1
yourself, 1
with, 1
having, 1
me, 1
for, 1
your, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
sister;, 1
and, 1
besides,", 1
she, 1
added,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
troubled, 1
and, 1
moistened, 1
with, 1
tears,, 1
"wait,, 1
wait,, 1
Fernand;, 1
you, 1
said, 1
just, 1
now, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
was, 1
treacherous,, 1

he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
gone, 1
four, 1
months,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
these, 1
four, 1
months, 1
there, 1
have, 1
been, 1
some, 1
terrible, 1
storms.", 1
Fernand, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply,, 1
nor, 1
did, 1
he, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
check, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
which, 1
flowed, 1
down, 1
the, 1
cheeks, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
although, 1
for, 1
each, 1
of, 1
these, 1
tears, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
shed, 1
his, 1
heart's, 1
blood;, 1
but, 1
these, 1
tears, 1
flowed, 1
for, 1
another., 1
He, 1
arose,, 1
paced, 1
a, 1
while, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
the, 1
hut,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
suddenly, 1
stopping, 1
before, 1
Mercedes,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
glowing, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
clinched,--"Say,, 1
Mercedes,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"once, 1
for, 1
all,, 1
is, 1
this, 1
your, 1
final, 1
determination?", 1
"I, 1
love, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,", 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
calmly, 1
replied,, 1
"and, 1
none, 1
but, 1
Edmond, 1
shall, 1
ever, 1
be, 1
my, 1
husband.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
will, 1
always, 1
love, 1
him?", 1
"As, 1
long, 1
as, 1
I, 1
live.", 1
Fernand, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
his, 1
head, 1
like, 1
a, 1
defeated, 1
man,, 1
heaved, 1
a, 1
sigh, 1
that, 1
was, 1
like, 1
a, 1
groan,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
suddenly, 1
looking, 1
her, 1
full, 1
in, 1
the, 1
face,, 1
with, 1
clinched, 1
teeth, 1
and, 1
expanded, 1
nostrils,, 1
said,--"But, 1
if, 1
he, 1
is, 1
dead"--, 1
"If, 1
he, 1
is, 1
dead,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
die, 1
too.", 1
"If, 1
he, 1
has, 1
forgotten, 1
you"--, 1
"Mercedes!", 1
called, 1
a, 1
joyous, 1
voice, 1
from, 1
without,--"Mercedes!", 1
"Ah,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
blushing, 1
with, 1
delight,, 1
and, 1
fairly, 1
leaping, 1
in, 1
excess, 1
of, 1
love,, 1
"you, 1
see, 1
he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
forgotten, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
here, 1
he, 1
is!", 1
And, 1
rushing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
she, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
saying,, 1
"Here,, 1
Edmond,, 1
here, 1
I, 1
am!", 1
Fernand,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling,, 1
drew, 1
back,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
a, 1
serpent,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
Edmond, 1
and, 1
Mercedes, 1
were, 1
clasped, 1
in, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
arms., 1
The, 1
burning, 1
Marseilles, 1
sun,, 1
which, 1
shot, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room, 1
through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
door,, 1
covered, 1
them, 1
with, 1
a, 1
flood, 1
of, 1
light., 1
At, 1
first, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
around, 1
them., 1
Their, 1
intense, 1
happiness, 1
isolated, 1
them, 1
from, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
only, 1
spoke, 1
in, 1
broken, 1
words,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
the, 1
tokens, 1
of, 1
a, 1
joy, 1
so, 1
extreme, 1
that, 1
they, 1
seem, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
sorrow., 1
Suddenly, 1
Edmond, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
gloomy,, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
threatening, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
Fernand,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
defined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow., 1
By, 1
a, 1
movement, 1
for, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
account, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
Catalan, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
at, 1
his, 1
belt., 1
"Ah,, 1
your, 1
pardon,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
frowning, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn;, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
perceive, 1
that, 1
there, 1
were, 1
three, 1
of, 1
us.", 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Mercedes,, 1
he, 1
inquired,, 1
"Who, 1
is, 1
this, 1
gentleman?", 1
"One, 1
who, 1
will, 1
be, 1
your, 1
best, 1
friend,, 1
Dantes,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
is, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
my, 1
cousin,, 1
my, 1
brother;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
Fernand--the, 1
man, 1
whom,, 1
after, 1
you,, 1
Edmond,, 1
I, 1
love, 1
the, 1
best, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
remember, 1
him?", 1
"Yes!", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
relinquishing, 1
Mercedes, 1
hand, 1
clasped, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
he, 1
extended, 1
the, 1
other, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cordial, 1
air., 1
But, 1
Fernand,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
responding, 1
to, 1
this, 1
amiable, 1
gesture,, 1
remained, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
trembling., 1
Edmond, 1
then, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
scrutinizingly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
agitated, 1
and, 1
embarrassed, 1
Mercedes,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
again, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
and, 1
menacing, 1
Fernand., 1
This, 1
look, 1
told, 1
him, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
anger, 1
waxed, 1
hot., 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
came, 1
with, 1
such, 1
haste, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
an, 1
enemy, 1
here.", 1
"An, 1
enemy!", 1
cried, 1
Mercedes,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
angry, 1
look, 1
at, 1
her, 1
cousin., 1
"An, 1
enemy, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
Edmond!, 1
If, 1
I, 1
believed, 1
that,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
place, 1
my, 1
arm, 1
under, 1
yours, 1
and, 1
go, 1
with, 1
you, 1
to, 1
Marseilles,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
house, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
it, 1
no, 1
more.", 1
Fernand's, 1
eye, 1
darted, 1
lightning., 1
"And, 1
should, 1
any, 1
misfortune, 1
occur, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
dear, 1
Edmond,", 1
she, 1
continued, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
calmness, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
Fernand, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
read, 1
the, 1
very, 1
innermost, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sinister, 1
thought,, 1
"if, 1
misfortune, 1
should, 1
occur, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
ascend, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
point, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cape, 1
de, 1
Morgion, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
myself, 1
headlong, 1
from, 1
it.", 1
Fernand, 1
became, 1
deadly, 1
pale., 1
"But, 1
you, 1
are, 1
deceived,, 1
Edmond,", 1
she, 1
continued., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
no, 1
enemy, 1
here--there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
one, 1
but, 1
Fernand,, 1
my, 1
brother,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
grasp, 1
your, 1
hand, 1
as, 1
a, 1
devoted, 1
friend.", 1
And, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
fixed, 1
her, 1
imperious, 1
look, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Catalan,, 1
who,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
fascinated, 1
by, 1
it,, 1
came, 1
slowly, 1
towards, 1
Edmond,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
His, 1
hatred,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
powerless, 1
though, 1
furious, 1
wave,, 1
was, 1
broken, 1
against, 1
the, 1
strong, 1
ascendancy, 1
which, 1
Mercedes, 1
exercised, 1
over, 1
him., 1
Scarcely,, 1
however,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
Edmond's, 1
hand, 1
than, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
all, 1
he, 1
could, 1
do,, 1
and, 1
rushed, 1
hastily, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
"Oh,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
running, 1
furiously, 1
and, 1
tearing, 1
his, 1
hair--"Oh,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
deliver, 1
me, 1
from, 1
this, 1
man?, 1
Wretched--wretched, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am!", 1
"Hallo,, 1
Catalan!, 1
Hallo,, 1
Fernand!, 1
where, 1
are, 1
you, 1
running, 1
to?", 1
exclaimed, 1
a, 1
voice., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
stopped, 1
suddenly,, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
perceived, 1
Caderousse, 1
sitting, 1
at, 1
table, 1
with, 1
Danglars,, 1
under, 1
an, 1
arbor., 1
"Well",, 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"why, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
come?, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
really, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
hurry, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
day, 1
with, 1
your, 1
friends?", 1
"Particularly, 1
when, 1
they, 1
have, 1
still, 1
a, 1
full, 1
bottle, 1
before, 1
them,", 1
added, 1
Danglars., 1
Fernand, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
them, 1
both, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stupefied, 1
air,, 1
but, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say, 1
a, 1
word., 1
"He, 1
seems, 1
besotted,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
pushing, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
his, 1
knee., 1
"Are, 1
we, 1
mistaken,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
Dantes, 1
triumphant, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
we, 1
have, 1
believed?", 1
"Why,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
inquire, 1
into, 1
that,", 1
was, 1
Caderousse's, 1
reply;, 1
and, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
said,, 1
"Well,, 1
Catalan,, 1
can't, 1
you, 1
make, 1
up, 1
your, 1
mind?", 1
Fernand, 1
wiped, 1
away, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
steaming, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
slowly, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
arbor,, 1
whose, 1
shade, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
somewhat, 1
of, 1
calmness, 1
to, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
coolness, 1
somewhat, 1
of, 1
refreshment, 1
to, 1
his, 1
exhausted, 1
body., 1
"Good-day,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"You, 1
called, 1
me,, 1
didn't, 1
you?", 1
And, 1
he, 1
fell,, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
on, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
seats, 1
which, 1
surrounded, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"I, 1
called, 1
you, 1
because, 1
you, 1
were, 1
running, 1
like, 1
a, 1
madman,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
afraid, 1
you, 1
would, 1
throw, 1
yourself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
laughing., 1
"Why,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
man, 1
has, 1
friends,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not, 1
only, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
him, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine,, 1
but,, 1
moreover,, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
his, 1
swallowing, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
pints, 1
of, 1
water, 1
unnecessarily!", 1
Fernand, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
groan,, 1
which, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
sob,, 1
and, 1
dropped, 1
his, 1
head, 1
into, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
his, 1
elbows, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"Well,, 1
Fernand,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
say,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
beginning, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
brutality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
common, 1
people, 1
in, 1
which, 1
curiosity, 1
destroys, 1
all, 1
diplomacy,, 1
"you, 1
look, 1
uncommonly, 1
like, 1
a, 1
rejected, 1
lover;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
laugh., 1
"Bah!", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"a, 1
lad, 1
of, 1
his, 1
make, 1
was, 1
not, 1
born, 1
to, 1
be, 1
unhappy, 1
in, 1
love., 1
You, 1
are, 1
laughing, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
Caderousse.", 1
"No,", 1
he, 1
replied,, 1
"only, 1
hark, 1
how, 1
he, 1
sighs!, 1
Come,, 1
come,, 1
Fernand,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"hold, 1
up, 1
your, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
answer, 1
us., 1
It's, 1
not, 1
polite, 1
not, 1
to, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
friends, 1
who, 1
ask, 1
news, 1
of, 1
your, 1
health.", 1
"My, 1
health, 1
is, 1
well, 1
enough,", 1
said, 1
Fernand,, 1
clinching, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
without, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
Danglars,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
winking, 1
at, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
how, 1
it, 1
is;, 1
Fernand,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
see, 1
here,, 1
is, 1
a, 1
good, 1
and, 1
brave, 1
Catalan,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
fishermen, 1
in, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
in, 1
love, 1
with, 1
a, 1
very, 1
fine, 1
girl,, 1
named, 1
Mercedes;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
appears,, 1
unfortunately,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
girl, 1
is, 1
in, 1
love, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
arrived, 1
to-day--why,, 1
you, 1
understand!", 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Poor, 1
Fernand, 1
has, 1
been, 1
dismissed,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Well,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
Fernand,, 1
lifting, 1
up, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
Caderousse, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
looks, 1
for, 1
some, 1
one, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
to, 1
vent, 1
his, 1
anger;, 1
"Mercedes, 1
is, 1
not, 1
accountable, 1
to, 1
any, 1
person,, 1
is, 1
she?, 1
Is, 1
she, 1
not, 1
free, 1
to, 1
love, 1
whomsoever, 1
she, 1
will?", 1
"Oh,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
take, 1
it, 1
in, 1
that, 1
sense,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
another, 1
thing., 1
But, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
Catalan,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
told, 1
me, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
were, 1
not, 1
men, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
themselves, 1
to, 1
be, 1
supplanted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
rival., 1
It, 1
was, 1
even, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
Fernand,, 1
especially,, 1
was, 1
terrible, 1
in, 1
his, 1
vengeance.", 1
Fernand, 1
smiled, 1
piteously., 1
"A, 1
lover, 1
is, 1
never, 1
terrible,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"Poor, 1
fellow!", 1
remarked, 1
Danglars,, 1
affecting, 1
to, 1
pity, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Dantes, 1
return, 1
so, 1
suddenly--he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dead,, 1
perhaps;, 1
or, 1
perchance, 1
faithless!, 1
These, 1
things, 1
always, 1
come, 1
on, 1
us, 1
more, 1
severely, 1
when, 1
they, 1
come, 1
suddenly.", 1
"Ah,, 1
ma, 1
foi,, 1
under, 1
any, 1
circumstances,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
drank, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
fumes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wine, 1
began, 1
to, 1
take, 1
effect,--"under, 1
any, 1
circumstances, 1
Fernand, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
only, 1
person, 1
put, 1
out, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fortunate, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
Dantes;, 1
is, 1
he,, 1
Danglars?", 1
"No,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right--and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
that, 1
would, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
ill-luck.", 1
"Well,, 1
never, 1
mind,", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
pouring, 1
out, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
for, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
filling, 1
his, 1
own, 1
for, 1
the, 1
eighth, 1
or, 1
ninth, 1
time,, 1
while, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
merely, 1
sipped, 1
his., 1
"Never, 1
mind--in, 1
the, 1
meantime, 1
he, 1
marries, 1
Mercedes--the, 1
lovely, 1
Mercedes--at, 1
least, 1
he, 1
returns, 1
to, 1
do, 1
that.", 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
Danglars, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
piercing, 1
glance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
on, 1
whose, 1
heart, 1
Caderousse's, 1
words, 1
fell, 1
like, 1
molten, 1
lead., 1
"And, 1
when, 1
is, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
to, 1
be?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
fixed!", 1
murmured, 1
Fernand., 1
"No,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"as, 1
surely, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
will, 1
be, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon--eh,, 1
Danglars?", 1
Danglars, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
attack,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
Caderousse,, 1
whose, 1
countenance, 1
he, 1
scrutinized,, 1
to, 1
try, 1
and, 1
detect, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
was, 1
premeditated;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
read, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
envy, 1
in, 1
a, 1
countenance, 1
already, 1
rendered, 1
brutal, 1
and, 1
stupid, 1
by, 1
drunkenness., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
filling, 1
the, 1
glasses,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
drink, 1
to, 1
Captain, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,, 1
husband, 1
of, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Catalane!", 1
Caderousse, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
glass, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
with, 1
unsteady, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
swallowed, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
at, 1
a, 1
gulp., 1
Fernand, 1
dashed, 1
his, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
"Eh,, 1
eh,, 1
eh!", 1
stammered, 1
Caderousse., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
I, 1
see, 1
down, 1
there, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Catalans?, 1
Look,, 1
Fernand,, 1
your, 1
eyes, 1
are, 1
better, 1
than, 1
mine., 1
I, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
see, 1
double., 1
You, 1
know, 1
wine, 1
is, 1
a, 1
deceiver;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
it, 1
was, 1
two, 1
lovers, 1
walking, 1
side, 1
by, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
hand., 1
Heaven, 1
forgive, 1
me,, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
we, 1
can, 1
see, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
are, 1
actually, 1
embracing!", 1
Danglars, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
one, 1
pang, 1
that, 1
Fernand, 1
endured., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
them,, 1
Fernand?", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"Yes,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
reply,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
Edmond, 1
and, 1
Mercedes!", 1
"Ah,, 1
see, 1
there,, 1
now!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
them!, 1
Hallo,, 1
Dantes!, 1
hello,, 1
lovely, 1
damsel!, 1
Come, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
know, 1
when, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be,, 1
for, 1
Fernand, 1
here, 1
is, 1
so, 1
obstinate, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
us.", 1
"Hold, 1
your, 1
tongue,, 1
will, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
pretending, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
tenacity, 1
of, 1
drunkards,, 1
leaned, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arbor., 1
"Try, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
upright,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
the, 1
lovers, 1
make, 1
love, 1
without, 1
interruption., 1
See,, 1
look, 1
at, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
his, 1
example;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
well-behaved!", 1
Fernand,, 1
probably, 1
excited, 1
beyond, 1
bearing,, 1
pricked, 1
by, 1
Danglars,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
bull, 1
is, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bandilleros,, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
rush, 1
out;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
had, 1
risen, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
collecting, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
dash, 1
headlong, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
rival,, 1
when, 1
Mercedes,, 1
smiling, 1
and, 1
graceful,, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
her, 1
lovely, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
them, 1
with, 1
her, 1
clear, 1
and, 1
bright, 1
eyes., 1
At, 1
this, 1
Fernand, 1
recollected, 1
her, 1
threat, 1
of, 1
dying, 1
if, 1
Edmond, 1
died,, 1
and, 1
dropped, 1
again, 1
heavily, 1
on, 1
his, 1
seat., 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men,, 1
one, 1
after, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
brutalized, 1
by, 1
liquor,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
love., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
get, 1
nothing, 1
from, 1
these, 1
fools,", 1
he, 1
muttered;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
much, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
being, 1
here, 1
between, 1
a, 1
drunkard, 1
and, 1
a, 1
coward., 1
Here's, 1
an, 1
envious, 1
fellow, 1
making, 1
himself, 1
boozy, 1
on, 1
wine, 1
when, 1
he, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
nursing, 1
his, 1
wrath,, 1
and, 1
here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fool, 1
who, 1
sees, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
he, 1
loves, 1
stolen, 1
from, 1
under, 1
his, 1
nose, 1
and, 1
takes, 1
on, 1
like, 1
a, 1
big, 1
baby., 1
Yet, 1
this, 1
Catalan, 1
has, 1
eyes, 1
that, 1
glisten, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vengeful, 1
Spaniards,, 1
Sicilians,, 1
and, 1
Calabrians,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
has, 1
fists, 1
big, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
crush, 1
an, 1
ox, 1
at, 1
one, 1
blow., 1
Unquestionably,, 1
Edmond's, 1
star, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ascendant,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
will, 1
marry, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
girl--he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
captain,, 1
too,, 1
and, 1
laugh, 1
at, 1
us, 1
all,, 1
unless"--a, 1
sinister, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
Danglars', 1
lips--"unless, 1
I, 1
take, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affair,", 1
he, 1
added., 1
"Hallo!", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
half-rising,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
his, 1
fist, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
"hallo,, 1
Edmond!, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
your, 1
friends,, 1

are, 1
you, 1
too, 1
proud, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
them?", 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow!", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
proud,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
am, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
happiness, 1
blinds,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
more, 1
than, 1
pride.", 1
"Ah,, 1
very, 1
well,, 1
that's, 1
an, 1
explanation!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
Madame, 1
Dantes?", 1
Mercedes, 1
courtesied, 1
gravely,, 1
and, 1
said--"That, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
name,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
my, 1
country, 1
it, 1
bodes, 1
ill, 1
fortune,, 1

say,, 1
to, 1
call, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
by, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
her, 1
betrothed, 1
before, 1
he, 1
becomes, 1
her, 1
husband., 1
So, 1
call, 1
me, 1
Mercedes,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
"We, 1
must, 1
excuse, 1
our, 1
worthy, 1
neighbor,, 1
Caderousse,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
so, 1
easily, 1
mistaken.", 1
"So,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
is, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place, 1
immediately,, 1
M., 1
Dantes,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
bowing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
couple., 1
"As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
M., 1
Danglars;, 1
to-day, 1
all, 1
preliminaries, 1
will, 1
be, 1
arranged, 1
at, 1
my, 1
father's,, 1
and, 1
to-morrow,, 1
or, 1
next, 1
day, 1
at, 1
latest,, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
festival, 1
here, 1
at, 1
La, 1
Reserve., 1
My, 1
friends, 1
will, 1
be, 1
there,, 1
I, 1
hope;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
invited,, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
Caderousse.", 1
"And, 1
Fernand,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
chuckle;, 1
"Fernand,, 1
too,, 1
is, 1
invited!", 1
"My, 1
wife's, 1
brother, 1
is, 1
my, 1
brother,", 1
said, 1
Edmond;, 1
"and, 1
we,, 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
I,, 1
should, 1
be, 1
very, 1
sorry, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
absent, 1
at, 1
such, 1
a, 1
time.", 1
Fernand, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
to, 1
reply,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
died, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
he, 1

it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
selfishness, 1
alone, 1
that, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
thus, 1
in, 1
haste;, 1

"Ah,, 1
really?--to, 1

said, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"To, 1

away,, 1

Edmond, 1
with, 1
a, 1
friendly, 1
nod,, 1

the, 1
two, 1

continued, 1
on, 1

calm, 1

Chapter, 1

Conspiracy., 1
Danglars, 1
followed, 1
Edmond, 1
and, 1
Mercedes, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
until, 1
the, 1
two, 1
lovers, 1
disappeared, 1
behind, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
angles, 1
of, 1
Fort, 1
Saint, 1
Nicolas,, 1
then, 1
turning, 1
round,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
Fernand,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
fallen,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling,, 1
into, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
while, 1
Caderousse, 1
stammered, 1
out, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
a, 1
drinking-song., 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,", 1

Danglars, 1
to, 1
Fernand,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1

"It, 1
drives, 1
me, 1
to, 1

Fernand., 1
"Do, 1

known, 1
her--always.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1

there,, 1
tearing, 1
your, 1

"I, 1
have, 1
found, 1
already.", 1
"What?", 1
"I, 1
would, 1
stab, 1
the, 1
man,, 1

Fernand,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
accents, 1
of, 1
unshaken, 1
resolution,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
die, 1
myself!", 1
"That's, 1
what, 1
I, 1
call, 1

Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
more, 1
tipsy, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
"That's, 1

upon, 1

us.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
Dantes', 1
good, 1
health!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
emptying, 1
his, 1
glass,, 1
"here's, 1
to, 1
his, 1
health!, 1
his, 1
health--hurrah!", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
means--the, 1
means?", 1
said, 1
Fernand., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
hit, 1
upon, 1
any?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
"No!--you, 1
undertook, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
"True,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars;, 1
"the, 1
French, 1
have, 1
the, 1
superiority, 1
over, 1
the, 1
Spaniards,, 1

"Do, 1
you, 1
invent,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Fernand, 1
impatiently., 1
"Waiter,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"pen,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper.", 1
"Pen,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper,", 1

Fernand., 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
supercargo;, 1

"Pen,, 1

called, 1
Fernand, 1
loudly., 1
"There's, 1
what, 1
you, 1
want, 1
on, 1
that, 1
table,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
waiter., 1
"Bring, 1
them, 1
here.", 1
The, 1
waiter, 1
did, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desired., 1
"When, 1
one, 1
thinks,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
letting, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
drop, 1
on, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1

is, 1
here, 1

Danglars., 1
"Give, 1
him, 1
some, 1
more, 1

Caderousse's, 1

confirmed, 1
toper, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
lifted, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
from, 1
the, 1

and, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
glass., 1
The, 1
Catalan, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
until, 1
Caderousse,, 1
almost, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
this, 1
fresh, 1
assault, 1
on, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1
rested,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
dropped,, 1
his, 1
glass, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"Well!", 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
Catalan,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
final, 1
glimmer, 1
of, 1
Caderousse's, 1
reason, 1
vanishing, 1
before, 1
the, 1
last, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1

should, 1
say,, 1
for, 1
instance,", 1

Danglars,, 1
"that, 1

hastily., 1
"Yes,, 1

Danglars,, 1

Danglars;, 1

Danglars, 1

the, 1
address, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
that's, 1

Caderousse,, 1
who,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
last, 1
effort, 1
of, 1
intellect,, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
reading, 1
of, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1

instinctively, 1
comprehended, 1
all, 1
the, 1
misery, 1

such, 1
a, 1
denunciation, 1
must, 1
entail., 1
"Yes,, 1

shame;", 1

he, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"Yes,", 1

Danglars,, 1
taking, 1
it, 1
from, 1
beyond, 1
his, 1
reach;, 1
"and, 1
as, 1
what, 1
I, 1
say, 1

merely, 1
in, 1
jest,, 1

here!", 1
And, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
he, 1
squeezed, 1
it, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands, 1

threw, 1
it, 1
into, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arbor., 1

Caderousse., 1

thinks, 1
of, 1
using, 1
him, 1
ill?, 1
Certainly, 1
neither, 1
I, 1

said, 1
Danglars,, 1
rising, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
still, 1
remained, 1
seated,, 1
but, 1
whose, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
denunciatory, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
paper, 1
flung, 1
into, 1
the, 1
corner., 1
"In, 1
this, 1
case,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"let's, 1
have, 1
some, 1
more, 1
wine., 1

Caderousse,, 1
rising, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
offended, 1
dignity, 1
of, 1
a, 1
drunken, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
can't, 1
keep, 1
on, 1

Caderousse;, 1

Danglars, 1
took, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
Caderousse's, 1
temper, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
to, 1
take, 1
him, 1
off, 1
towards, 1
Marseilles, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porte, 1
Saint-Victor,, 1
staggering, 1

he, 1
went., 1
When, 1
they, 1
had, 1
advanced, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
yards,, 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
back, 1

stoop,, 1
pick, 1
up, 1

crumpled, 1

Caderousse,, 1
"why,, 1

the, 1
Pharaon, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
the, 1
nuptial, 1
feast;, 1
but, 1
all, 1
seemed, 1
unanimous, 1
in, 1
doubting, 1
that, 1
an, 1
act, 1
of, 1
such, 1
rare, 1
and, 1
exceeding, 1
condescension, 1
could, 1
possibly, 1
be, 1
intended., 1
Danglars,, 1
however,, 1
who, 1
now, 1
made, 1
his, 1
appearance,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Caderousse,, 1
effectually, 1
confirmed, 1
the, 1
report,, 1
stating, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
recently, 1
conversed, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
assured, 1
him, 1
of, 1
his, 1
intention, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
at, 1
La, 1
Reserve., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
later, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
appeared, 1
and, 1
was, 1
saluted, 1
with, 1
an, 1
enthusiastic, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
applause, 1
from, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
who, 1
hailed, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shipowner, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sure, 1
indication, 1
that, 1
the, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
wedding, 1
feast, 1
he, 1
thus, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
honor, 1
would, 1
ere, 1
long, 1
be, 1
first, 1
in, 1
command, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ship;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
universally, 1
beloved, 1
on, 1
board, 1
his, 1
vessel,, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
put, 1
no, 1
restraint, 1
on, 1
their, 1
tumultuous, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
finding, 1
that, 1
the, 1
opinion, 1
and, 1
choice, 1
of, 1
their, 1
superiors, 1
so, 1
exactly, 1
coincided, 1
with, 1
their, 1
own., 1
With, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Caderousse, 1
were, 1
despatched, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bride-groom, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
intelligence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
important, 1
personage, 1
whose, 1
coming, 1
had, 1
created, 1
such, 1
a, 1
lively, 1
sensation,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
beseech, 1
him, 1
to, 1
make, 1
haste., 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Caderousse, 1
set, 1
off, 1
upon, 1
their, 1
errand, 1
at, 1
full, 1
speed;, 1
but, 1
ere, 1
they, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
many, 1
steps, 1
they, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
group, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
them,, 1
composed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
betrothed, 1
pair,, 1
a, 1
party, 1
of, 1
young, 1
girls, 1
in, 1
attendance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bride,, 1
by, 1
whose, 1
side, 1
walked, 1
Dantes', 1
father;, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
by, 1
Fernand,, 1
whose, 1
lips, 1
wore, 1
their, 1
usual, 1
sinister, 1
smile., 1
Neither, 1
Mercedes, 1
nor, 1
Edmond, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
so, 1
happy, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
conscious, 1
only, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sunshine, 1
and, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
each, 1
other., 1
Having, 1
acquitted, 1
themselves, 1
of, 1
their, 1
errand,, 1
and, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
hearty, 1
shake, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
Edmond,, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Caderousse, 1
took, 1
their, 1
places, 1
beside, 1
Fernand, 1
and, 1
old, 1
Dantes,--the, 1
latter, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
attracted, 1
universal, 1
notice., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
was, 1
attired, 1
in, 1
a, 1
suit, 1
of, 1
glistening, 1
watered, 1
silk,, 1
trimmed, 1
with, 1
steel, 1
buttons,, 1
beautifully, 1
cut, 1
and, 1
polished., 1
His, 1
thin, 1
but, 1
wiry, 1
legs, 1
were, 1
arrayed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
richly, 1
embroidered, 1
clocked, 1
stockings,, 1
evidently, 1
of, 1
English, 1
manufacture,, 1
while, 1
from, 1
his, 1
three-cornered, 1
hat, 1
depended, 1
a, 1
long, 1
streaming, 1
knot, 1
of, 1
white, 1
and, 1
blue, 1
ribbons., 1
Thus, 1
he, 1
came, 1
along,, 1
supporting, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
a, 1
curiously, 1
carved, 1
stick,, 1
his, 1
aged, 1
countenance, 1
lit, 1
up, 1
with, 1
happiness,, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
like, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
aged, 1
dandies, 1
of, 1
1796,, 1
parading, 1
the, 1
newly, 1
opened, 1
gardens, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Tuileries, 1
and, 1
Luxembourg., 1
Beside, 1
him, 1
glided, 1
Caderousse,, 1
whose, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
partake, 1
of, 1
the, 1
good, 1
things, 1
provided, 1
for, 1
the, 1
wedding-party, 1
had, 1
induced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
become, 1
reconciled, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Dantes,, 1
father, 1
and, 1
son,, 1
although, 1
there, 1
still, 1
lingered, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
and, 1
unperfect, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
events, 1
of, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
night;, 1
just, 1
as, 1
the, 1
brain, 1
retains, 1
on, 1
waking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
the, 1
dim, 1
and, 1
misty, 1
outline, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
As, 1
Danglars, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
disappointed, 1
lover,, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
on, 1
him, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
meaning,, 1
while, 1
Fernand,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
slowly, 1
paced, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
happy, 1
pair,, 1
who, 1
seemed,, 1
in, 1
their, 1
own, 1
unmixed, 1
content,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
entirely, 1
forgotten, 1
that, 1
such, 1
a, 1
being, 1
as, 1
himself, 1
existed,, 1
was, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
abstracted;, 1
occasionally,, 1
however,, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
flush, 1
would, 1
overspread, 1
his, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
contraction, 1
distort, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
while,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
agitated, 1
and, 1
restless, 1
gaze,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
glance, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
like, 1
one, 1
who, 1
either, 1
anticipated, 1
or, 1
foresaw, 1
some, 1
great, 1
and, 1
important, 1
event., 1
Dantes, 1
himself, 1
was, 1
simply,, 1
but, 1
becomingly,, 1
clad, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dress, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
merchant, 1
service--a, 1
costume, 1
somewhat, 1
between, 1
a, 1
military, 1
and, 1
a, 1
civil, 1
garb;, 1
and, 1
with, 1
his, 1
fine, 1
countenance,, 1
radiant, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
happiness,, 1
a, 1
more, 1
perfect, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1
manly, 1
beauty, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
be, 1
imagined., 1
Lovely, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
girls, 1
of, 1
Cyprus, 1
or, 1
Chios,, 1
Mercedes, 1
boasted, 1
the, 1
same, 1
bright, 1
flashing, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
jet,, 1
and, 1
ripe,, 1
round,, 1
coral, 1
lips., 1
She, 1
moved, 1
with, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
free, 1
step, 1
of, 1
an, 1
Arlesienne, 1
or, 1
an, 1
Andalusian., 1
One, 1
more, 1
practiced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arts, 1
of, 1
great, 1
cities, 1
would, 1
have, 1
hid, 1
her, 1
blushes, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
veil,, 1
or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
have, 1
cast, 1
down, 1
her, 1
thickly, 1
fringed, 1
lashes,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
have, 1
concealed, 1
the, 1
liquid, 1
lustre, 1
of, 1
her, 1
animated, 1
eyes;, 1
but,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
the, 1
delighted, 1
girl, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
her, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say:, 1
"If, 1
you, 1
are, 1
my, 1
friends,, 1
rejoice, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
happy.", 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
the, 1
bridal, 1
party, 1
came, 1
in, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Reserve,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
descended, 1
and, 1
came, 1
forth, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
it,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
soldiers, 1
and, 1
sailors, 1
there, 1
assembled,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
already, 1
given,, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
should, 1
be, 1
the, 1
successor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
late, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere., 1
Edmond,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
his, 1
patron,, 1
respectfully, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
his, 1
affianced, 1
bride, 1
within, 1
that, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
who,, 1
forthwith, 1
conducting, 1
her, 1
up, 1
the, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
wooden, 1
steps, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
feast, 1
was, 1
prepared,, 1
was, 1
gayly, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
guests,, 1
beneath, 1
whose, 1
heavy, 1
tread, 1
the, 1
slight, 1
structure, 1
creaked, 1
and, 1
groaned, 1
for, 1
the, 1
space, 1
of, 1
several, 1
minutes., 1
"Father,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
stopping, 1
when, 1
she, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
"sit,, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
you,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
right, 1
hand;, 1
on, 1
my, 1
left, 1
I, 1
will, 1
place, 1
him, 1
who, 1
has, 1
ever, 1
been, 1
as, 1
a, 1
brother, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
pointing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
soft, 1
and, 1
gentle, 1
smile, 1
to, 1
Fernand;, 1
but, 1
her, 1
words, 1
and, 1
look, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
inflict, 1
the, 1
direst, 1
torture, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
became, 1
ghastly, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
hue, 1
of, 1
his, 1
complexion, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
retreating, 1
as, 1
though, 1
some, 1
sudden, 1
pang, 1
drove, 1
it, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
Dantes,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
similarly, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
most, 1
honored, 1
guests., 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
his, 1
right, 1
hand,, 1
Danglars, 1
at, 1
his, 1
left;, 1
while,, 1
at, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
Edmond,, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
company, 1
ranged, 1
themselves, 1
as, 1
they, 1
found, 1
it, 1
most, 1
agreeable., 1
Then, 1
they, 1
began, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
around, 1
the, 1
dusky,, 1
piquant,, 1
Arlesian, 1
sausages,, 1
and, 1
lobsters, 1
in, 1
their, 1
dazzling, 1
red, 1
cuirasses,, 1
prawns, 1
of, 1
large, 1
size, 1
and, 1
brilliant, 1
color,, 1
the, 1
echinus, 1
with, 1
its, 1
prickly, 1
outside, 1
and, 1
dainty, 1
morsel, 1
within,, 1
the, 1
clovis,, 1
esteemed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
epicures, 1
of, 1
the, 1
South, 1
as, 1
more, 1
than, 1
rivalling, 1
the, 1
exquisite, 1
flavor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oyster,--all, 1
the, 1
delicacies,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
that, 1
are, 1
cast, 1
up, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wash, 1
of, 1
waters, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sandy, 1
beach,, 1
and, 1
styled, 1
by, 1
the, 1
grateful, 1
fishermen, 1
"fruits, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea.", 1
"A, 1
pretty, 1
silence, 1
truly!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
father, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bride-groom,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hue, 1
and, 1
brightness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
topaz,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
just, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
before, 1
Mercedes, 1
herself., 1
"Now,, 1
would, 1
anybody, 1
think, 1
that, 1
this, 1
room, 1
contained, 1
a, 1
happy,, 1
merry, 1
party,, 1
who, 1
desire, 1
nothing, 1
better, 1
than, 1
to, 1
laugh, 1
and, 1
dance, 1
the, 1
hours, 1
away?", 1
"Ah,", 1
sighed, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"a, 1
man, 1
cannot, 1
always, 1
feel, 1
happy, 1
because, 1
he, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married.", 1
"The, 1
truth, 1
is,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
too, 1
happy, 1
for, 1
noisy, 1
mirth;, 1
if, 1
that, 1
is, 1
what, 1
you, 1
meant, 1
by, 1
your, 1
observation,, 1
my, 1
worthy, 1
friend,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
joy, 1
takes, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
effect, 1
at, 1
times,, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
oppress, 1
us, 1
almost, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
sorrow.", 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
towards, 1
Fernand,, 1
whose, 1
excitable, 1
nature, 1
received, 1
and, 1
betrayed, 1
each, 1
fresh, 1
impression., 1
"Why,, 1
what, 1
ails, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
he, 1
of, 1
Edmond., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
fear, 1
any, 1
approaching, 1
evil?, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
the, 1
happiest, 1
man, 1
alive, 1
at, 1
this, 1
instant.", 1
"And, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
very, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
alarms, 1
me,", 1
returned, 1
Dantes., 1
"Man, 1
does, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
enjoy, 1
felicity, 1
so, 1
unmixed;, 1
happiness, 1
is, 1
like, 1
the, 1
enchanted, 1
palaces, 1
we, 1
read, 1
of, 1
in, 1
our, 1
childhood,, 1
where, 1
fierce,, 1
fiery, 1
dragons, 1
defend, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
and, 1
approach;, 1
and, 1
monsters, 1
of, 1
all, 1
shapes, 1
and, 1
kinds,, 1
requiring, 1
to, 1
be, 1
overcome, 1
ere, 1
victory, 1
is, 1
ours., 1
I, 1
own, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
wonder, 1
to, 1
find, 1
myself, 1
promoted, 1
to, 1
an, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
myself, 1
unworthy--that, 1
of, 1
being, 1
the, 1
husband, 1
of, 1
Mercedes.", 1
"Nay,, 1
nay!", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
smiling,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
attained, 1
that, 1
honor, 1
yet., 1
Mercedes, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
your, 1
wife., 1
Just, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
husband,, 1
and, 1
see, 1
how, 1
she, 1
will, 1
remind, 1
you, 1
that, 1
your, 1
hour, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
come!", 1
The, 1
bride, 1
blushed,, 1
while, 1
Fernand,, 1
restless, 1
and, 1
uneasy,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
start, 1
at, 1
every, 1
fresh, 1
sound,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
wiped, 1
away, 1
the, 1
large, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
perspiration, 1
that, 1
gathered, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
"Well,, 1
never, 1
mind, 1
that,, 1
neighbor, 1
Caderousse;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
worth, 1
while, 1
to, 1
contradict, 1
me, 1
for, 1
such, 1
a, 1
trifle, 1
as, 1
that., 1
'Tis, 1
true, 1
that, 1
Mercedes, 1
is, 1
not, 1
actually, 1
my, 1
wife;, 1
but,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
drawing, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
"in, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
she, 1
will, 1
be.", 1
A, 1
general, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
surprise, 1
ran, 1
round, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
Dantes,, 1
whose, 1
laugh, 1
displayed, 1
the, 1
still, 1
perfect, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
his, 1
large, 1
white, 1
teeth., 1
Mercedes, 1
looked, 1
pleased, 1
and, 1
gratified,, 1
while, 1
Fernand, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
handle, 1
of, 1
his, 1
knife, 1
with, 1
a, 1
convulsive, 1
clutch., 1
"In, 1
an, 1
hour?", 1
inquired, 1
Danglars,, 1
turning, 1
pale., 1
"How, 1
is, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
friend?", 1
"Why,, 1
thus, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
"Thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
to, 1
whom,, 1
next, 1
to, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
every, 1
blessing, 1
I, 1
enjoy,, 1
every, 1
difficulty, 1
his, 1
been, 1
removed., 1
We, 1
have, 1
purchased, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
waive, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
delay;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
mayor, 1
of, 1
Marseilles, 1
will, 1
be, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
us, 1
at, 1
the, 1
city, 1
hall., 1
Now,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
quarter-past, 1
one, 1
has, 1
already, 1
struck,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
consider, 1
I, 1
have, 1
asserted, 1
too, 1
much, 1
in, 1
saying,, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
another, 1
hour, 1
and, 1
thirty, 1
minutes, 1
Mercedes, 1
will, 1
have, 1
become, 1
Madame, 1
Dantes.", 1
Fernand, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
a, 1
burning, 1
sensation, 1
passed, 1
across, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
support, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
the, 1
table, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
his, 1
falling, 1
from, 1
his, 1
chair;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
his, 1
efforts,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
groan,, 1
which,, 1
however,, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
noisy, 1
felicitations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
company., 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"you, 1
make, 1
short, 1
work, 1
of, 1
this, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
affair., 1
Arrived, 1
here, 1
only, 1
yesterday, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
married, 1
to-day, 1
at, 1
three, 1
o'clock!, 1
Commend, 1
me, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
for, 1
going, 1
the, 1
quick, 1
way, 1
to, 1
work!", 1
"But,", 1
asked, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
timid, 1
tone,, 1
"how, 1
did, 1
you, 1
manage, 1
about, 1
the, 1
other, 1
formalities--the, 1
contract--the, 1
settlement?", 1
"The, 1
contract,", 1
answered, 1
Dantes,, 1
laughingly,, 1
"it, 1
didn't, 1
take, 1
long, 1
to, 1
fix, 1
that., 1
Mercedes, 1
has, 1
no, 1
fortune;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
none, 1
to, 1
settle, 1
on, 1
her., 1
So,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
our, 1
papers, 1
were, 1
quickly, 1
written, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
do, 1
not, 1
come, 1
very, 1
expensive.", 1
This, 1
joke, 1
elicited, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
applause., 1
"So, 1
that, 1
what, 1
we, 1
presumed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
merely, 1
the, 1
betrothal, 1
feast, 1
turns, 1
out, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
actual, 1
wedding, 1
dinner!", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
answered, 1
Dantes;, 1
"don't, 1
imagine, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
put, 1
you, 1
off, 1
in, 1
that, 1
shabby, 1
manner., 1
To-morrow, 1
morning, 1
I, 1
start, 1
for, 1
Paris;, 1
four, 1
days, 1
to, 1
go,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
same, 1
to, 1
return,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
day, 1
to, 1
discharge, 1
the, 1
commission, 1
intrusted, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
is, 1
all, 1
the, 1
time, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
absent., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
back, 1
here, 1
by, 1
the, 1
first, 1
of, 1
March,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
I, 1
give, 1
my, 1
real, 1
marriage, 1
feast.", 1
This, 1
prospect, 1
of, 1
fresh, 1
festivity, 1
redoubled, 1
the, 1
hilarity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
degree,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
Dantes,, 1
who,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
commencement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
repast,, 1
had, 1
commented, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
that, 1
prevailed,, 1
now, 1
found, 1
it, 1
difficult,, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
general, 1
din, 1
of, 1
voices,, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
tranquillity, 1
in, 1
which, 1
to, 1
drink, 1
to, 1
the, 1
health, 1
and, 1
prosperity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bride, 1
and, 1
bride-groom., 1
Dantes,, 1
perceiving, 1
the, 1
affectionate, 1
eagerness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
responded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
grateful, 1
pleasure;, 1
while, 1
Mercedes, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
and, 1
made, 1
an, 1
expressive, 1
gesture, 1
to, 1
Edmond., 1
Around, 1
the, 1
table, 1
reigned, 1
that, 1
noisy, 1
hilarity, 1
which, 1
usually, 1
prevails, 1
at, 1
such, 1
a, 1
time, 1
among, 1
people, 1
sufficiently, 1
free, 1
from, 1
the, 1
demands, 1
of, 1
social, 1
position, 1
not, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
trammels, 1
of, 1
etiquette., 1
Such, 1
as, 1
at, 1
the, 1
commencement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
repast, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
seat, 1
themselves, 1
according, 1
to, 1
their, 1
inclination, 1
rose, 1
unceremoniously,, 1
and, 1
sought, 1
out, 1
more, 1
agreeable, 1
companions., 1
Everybody, 1
talked, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
without, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
a, 1
reply, 1
and, 1
each, 1
one, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
contented, 1
with, 1
expressing, 1
his, 1
or, 1
her, 1
own, 1
thoughts., 1
Fernand's, 1
paleness, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
communicated, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
Danglars., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Fernand, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
enduring, 1
the, 1
tortures, 1
of, 1
the, 1
damned;, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
rest,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
among, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
the, 1
hilarious, 1
mirth, 1
that, 1
rose, 1
in, 1
such, 1
deafening, 1
sounds,, 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
silence,, 1
to, 1
pace, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
Caderousse, 1
approached, 1
him, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Danglars,, 1
whom, 1
Fernand, 1
seemed, 1
most, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
avoid,, 1
had, 1
joined, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
from, 1
whose, 1
mind, 1
the, 1
friendly, 1
treatment, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
united, 1
with, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
the, 1
excellent, 1
wine, 1
he, 1
had, 1
partaken, 1
of,, 1
had, 1
effaced, 1
every, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
envy, 1
or, 1
jealousy, 1
at, 1
Dantes', 1
good, 1
fortune,--"upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
Dantes, 1
is, 1
a, 1
downright, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
see, 1
him, 1
sitting, 1
there, 1
beside, 1
his, 1
pretty, 1
wife, 1
that, 1
is, 1
so, 1
soon, 1
to, 1
be., 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
thinking, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
great, 1
pity, 1
to, 1
have, 1
served, 1
him, 1
that, 1
trick, 1
you, 1
were, 1
planning, 1
yesterday.", 1
"Oh,, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
harm, 1
meant,", 1
answered, 1
Danglars;, 1
"at, 1
first, 1
I, 1
certainly, 1
did, 1
feel, 1
somewhat, 1
uneasy, 1
as, 1
to, 1
what, 1
Fernand, 1
might, 1
be, 1
tempted, 1
to, 1
do;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
how, 1
completely, 1
he, 1
had, 1
mastered, 1
his, 1
feelings,, 1
even, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
become, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
rival's, 1
attendants,, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
further, 1
cause, 1
for, 1
apprehension.", 1
Caderousse, 1
looked, 1
full, 1
at, 1
Fernand--he, 1
was, 1
ghastly, 1
pale., 1
"Certainly,", 1
continued, 1
Danglars,, 1
"the, 1
sacrifice, 1
was, 1
no, 1
trifling, 1
one,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bride, 1
is, 1
concerned., 1
Upon, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
that, 1
future, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
mine, 1
is, 1
a, 1
lucky, 1
dog!, 1
Gad,, 1
I, 1
only, 1
wish, 1
he, 1
would, 1
let, 1
me, 1
take, 1
his, 1
place.", 1
"Shall, 1
we, 1
not, 1
set, 1
forth?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
sweet,, 1
silvery, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
Mercedes;, 1
"two, 1
o'clock, 1
has, 1
just, 1
struck,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
know, 1
we, 1
are, 1
expected, 1
in, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour.", 1
"To, 1
be, 1
sure!--to, 1
be, 1
sure!", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
eagerly, 1
quitting, 1
the, 1
table;, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
directly!", 1
His, 1
words, 1
were, 1
re-echoed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
party,, 1
with, 1
vociferous, 1
cheers., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
incessantly, 1
observing, 1
every, 1
change, 1
in, 1
Fernand's, 1
look, 1
and, 1
manner,, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
stagger, 1
and, 1
fall, 1
back,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
convulsive, 1
spasm,, 1
against, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
placed, 1
near, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
open, 1
windows., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
caught, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
indistinct, 1
sound, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
measured, 1
tread, 1
of, 1
soldiery,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
clanking, 1
of, 1
swords, 1
and, 1
military, 1
accoutrements;, 1
then, 1
came, 1
a, 1
hum, 1
and, 1
buzz, 1
as, 1
of, 1
many, 1
voices,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
deaden, 1
even, 1
the, 1
noisy, 1
mirth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bridal, 1
party,, 1
among, 1
whom, 1
a, 1
vague, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
curiosity, 1
and, 1
apprehension, 1
quelled, 1
every, 1
disposition, 1
to, 1
talk,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
instantaneously, 1
the, 1
most, 1
deathlike, 1
stillness, 1
prevailed., 1
The, 1
sounds, 1
drew, 1
nearer., 1
Three, 1
blows, 1
were, 1
struck, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
panel, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
company, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
in, 1
consternation., 1
"I, 1
demand, 1
admittance,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
voice, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
"in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law!", 1
As, 1
no, 1
attempt, 1
was, 1
made, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
it,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
wearing, 1
his, 1
official, 1
scarf,, 1
presented, 1
himself,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
four, 1
soldiers, 1
and, 1
a, 1
corporal., 1
Uneasiness, 1
now, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
most, 1
extreme, 1
dread, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
those, 1
present., 1
"May, 1
I, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
visit?", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
evidently, 1
knew;, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
doubtless, 1
some, 1
mistake, 1
easily, 1
explained.", 1
"If, 1
it, 1
be, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
"rely, 1
upon, 1
every, 1
reparation, 1
being, 1
made;, 1
meanwhile,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
bearer, 1
of, 1
an, 1
order, 1
of, 1
arrest,, 1
and, 1
although, 1
I, 1
most, 1
reluctantly, 1
perform, 1
the, 1
task, 1
assigned, 1
me,, 1
it, 1
must,, 1
nevertheless,, 1
be, 1
fulfilled., 1
Who, 1
among, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
here, 1
assembled, 1
answers, 1
to, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes?", 1
Every, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agitation, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
but, 1
feel,, 1
advanced, 1
with, 1
dignity,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
voice,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
he;, 1
what, 1
is, 1
your, 1
pleasure, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
"I, 1
arrest, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law!", 1
"Me!", 1
repeated, 1
Edmond,, 1
slightly, 1
changing, 1
color,, 1
"and, 1
wherefore,, 1
I, 1
pray?", 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
inform, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
duly, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
reasons, 1
that, 1
have, 1
rendered, 1
such, 1
a, 1
step, 1
necessary, 1
at, 1
the, 1
preliminary, 1
examination.", 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
further, 1
resistance, 1
or, 1
remonstrance, 1
was, 1
useless., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
before, 1
him, 1
an, 1
officer, 1
delegated, 1
to, 1
enforce, 1
the, 1
law,, 1
and, 1
perfectly, 1
well, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
as, 1
unavailing, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
pity, 1
from, 1
a, 1
magistrate, 1
decked, 1
with, 1
his, 1
official, 1
scarf,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
address, 1
a, 1
petition, 1
to, 1
some, 1
cold, 1
marble, 1
effigy., 1
Old, 1
Dantes,, 1
however,, 1
sprang, 1
forward., 1
There, 1
are, 1
situations, 1
which, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
or, 1
a, 1
mother, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
made, 1
to, 1
understand., 1
He, 1
prayed, 1
and, 1
supplicated, 1
in, 1
terms, 1
so, 1
moving,, 1
that, 1
even, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
was, 1
touched,, 1
and,, 1
although, 1
firm, 1
in, 1
his, 1
duty,, 1
he, 1
kindly, 1
said,, 1
"My, 1
worthy, 1
friend,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you, 1
to, 1
calm, 1
your, 1
apprehensions., 1
Your, 1
son, 1
has, 1
probably, 1
neglected, 1
some, 1
prescribed, 1
form, 1
or, 1
attention, 1
in, 1
registering, 1
his, 1
cargo,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
probable, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
directly, 1
he, 1
has, 1
given, 1
the, 1
information, 1
required,, 1
whether, 1
touching, 1
the, 1
health, 1
of, 1
his, 1
crew,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
his, 1
freight.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse,, 1
frowningly,, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
utter, 1
surprise., 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you?", 1
replied, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
am,, 1
like, 1
yourself,, 1
utterly, 1
bewildered, 1
at, 1
all, 1
that, 1
is, 1
going, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
cannot, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
make, 1
out, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
about.", 1
Caderousse, 1
then, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
Fernand,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
night, 1
now, 1
came, 1
back, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
with, 1
startling, 1
clearness., 1
The, 1
painful, 1
catastrophe, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
witnessed, 1
appeared, 1
effectually, 1
to, 1
have, 1
rent, 1
away, 1
the, 1
veil, 1
which, 1
the, 1
intoxication, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
before, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
between, 1
himself, 1
and, 1
his, 1
memory., 1
"So,, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
and, 1
choking, 1
voice,, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
"this,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
suppose,, 1
is, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
trick, 1
you, 1
were, 1
concerting, 1
yesterday?, 1
All, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
so,, 1
'tis, 1
an, 1
ill, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
well, 1
deserves, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
double, 1
evil, 1
on, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
projected, 1
it.", 1
"Nonsense,", 1
returned, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
again, 1
I, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
whatever, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
it;, 1
besides,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
very, 1
well, 1
that, 1
I, 1
tore, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
to, 1
pieces.", 1
"No,, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not!", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"you, 1
merely, 1
threw, 1
it, 1
by--I, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
lying, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner.", 1
"Hold, 1
your, 1
tongue,, 1
you, 1
fool!--what, 1
should, 1
you, 1
know, 1
about, 1
it?--why,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
drunk!", 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
Fernand?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
I, 1
know?", 1
replied, 1
Danglars;, 1
"gone,, 1
as, 1
every, 1
prudent, 1
man, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be,, 1
to, 1
look, 1
after, 1
his, 1
own, 1
affairs,, 1
most, 1
likely., 1
Never, 1
mind, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
let, 1
you, 1
and, 1
I, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see, 1
what, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
done, 1
for, 1
our, 1
poor, 1
friends.", 1
During, 1
this, 1
conversation,, 1
Dantes,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
cheerful, 1
shake, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
all, 1
his, 1
sympathizing, 1
friends,, 1
had, 1
surrendered, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
arrest, 1
him,, 1
merely, 1
saying,, 1
"Make, 1
yourselves, 1
quite, 1
easy,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellows,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
some, 1
little, 1
mistake, 1
to, 1
clear, 1
up,, 1
that's, 1
all,, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
I, 1
may, 1
not, 1
have, 1
to, 1
go, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
the, 1
prison, 1
to, 1
effect, 1
that.", 1
"Oh,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sure!", 1
responded, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
now, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
group,, 1
"nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
mistake,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
quite, 1
certain.", 1
Dantes, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
and, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
soldiers., 1
A, 1
carriage, 1
awaited, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
got, 1
in,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
two, 1
soldiers, 1
and, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
drove, 1
off, 1
towards, 1
Marseilles., 1
"Adieu,, 1
adieu,, 1
dearest, 1
Edmond!", 1
cried, 1
Mercedes,, 1
stretching, 1
out, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
him, 1
from, 1
the, 1
balcony., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
cry,, 1
which, 1
sounded, 1
like, 1
the, 1
sob, 1
of, 1
a, 1
broken, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
leaning, 1
from, 1
the, 1
coach, 1
he, 1
called, 1
out,, 1
"Good-by,, 1
Mercedes--we, 1
shall, 1
soon, 1
meet, 1
again!", 1
Then, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
disappeared, 1
round, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
turnings, 1
of, 1
Fort, 1
Saint, 1
Nicholas., 1
"Wait, 1
for, 1
me, 1
here,, 1
all, 1
of, 1
you!", 1
cried, 1
M., 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
the, 1
first, 1
conveyance, 1
I, 1
find,, 1
and, 1
hurry, 1
to, 1
Marseilles,, 1
whence, 1
I, 1
will, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
word, 1
how, 1
all, 1
is, 1
going, 1
on.", 1
"That's, 1
right!", 1
exclaimed, 1
a, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
voices,, 1
"go,, 1
and, 1
return, 1
as, 1
quickly, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can!", 1
This, 1
second, 1
departure, 1
was, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
long, 1
and, 1
fearful, 1
state, 1
of, 1
terrified, 1
silence, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
were, 1
left, 1
behind., 1
The, 1
old, 1
father, 1
and, 1
Mercedes, 1
remained, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
apart,, 1
each, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
grief;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
length, 1
the, 1
two, 1
poor, 1
victims, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
blow, 1
raised, 1
their, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
simultaneous, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
feeling, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
arms., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Fernand, 1
made, 1
his, 1
appearance,, 1
poured, 1
out, 1
for, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
water, 1
with, 1
a, 1
trembling, 1
hand;, 1
then, 1
hastily, 1
swallowing, 1
it,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
vacant, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
was,, 1
by, 1
mere, 1
chance,, 1
placed, 1
next, 1
to, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
on, 1
which, 1
poor, 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
half, 1
fainting,, 1
when, 1
released, 1
from, 1
the, 1
warm, 1
and, 1
affectionate, 1
embrace, 1
of, 1
old, 1
Dantes., 1
Instinctively, 1
Fernand, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
his, 1
chair., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
misery--I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
whispered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
never, 1
taken, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
off, 1
Fernand,, 1
to, 1
Danglars., 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
think, 1
so,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
other;, 1
"he's, 1
too, 1
stupid, 1
to, 1
imagine, 1
such, 1
a, 1
scheme., 1
I, 1
only, 1
hope, 1
the, 1
mischief, 1
will, 1
fall, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
whoever, 1
wrought, 1
it.", 1
"You, 1
don't, 1
mention, 1
those, 1
who, 1
aided, 1
and, 1
abetted, 1
the, 1
deed,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Surely,", 1
answered, 1
Danglars,, 1
"one, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
held, 1
responsible, 1
for, 1
every, 1
chance, 1
arrow, 1
shot, 1
into, 1
the, 1
air.", 1
"You, 1
can,, 1
indeed,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
arrow, 1
lights, 1
point, 1
downward, 1
on, 1
somebody's, 1
head.", 1
Meantime, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arrest, 1
was, 1
being, 1
canvassed, 1
in, 1
every, 1
different, 1
form., 1
"What, 1
think, 1
you,, 1
Danglars,", 1
said, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
party,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
him,, 1
"of, 1
this, 1
event?", 1
"Why,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
just, 1
possible, 1
Dantes, 1
may, 1
have, 1
been, 1
detected, 1
with, 1
some, 1
trifling, 1
article, 1
on, 1
board, 1
ship, 1
considered, 1
here, 1
as, 1
contraband.", 1
"But, 1
how, 1
could, 1
he, 1
have, 1
done, 1
so, 1
without, 1
your, 1
knowledge,, 1
Danglars,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
ship's, 1
supercargo?", 1
"Why,, 1
as, 1
for, 1
that,, 1
I, 1
could, 1
only, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
was, 1
told, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
merchandise, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
laden., 1
I, 1
know, 1
she, 1
was, 1
loaded, 1
with, 1
cotton,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
took, 1
in, 1
her, 1
freight, 1
at, 1
Alexandria, 1
from, 1
Pastret's, 1
warehouse,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
Smyrna, 1
from, 1
Pascal's;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
I, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
any, 1
further, 1
particulars.", 1
"Now, 1
I, 1
recollect,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
afflicted, 1
old, 1
father;, 1
"my, 1
poor, 1
boy, 1
told, 1
me, 1
yesterday, 1
he, 1
had, 1
got, 1
a, 1
small, 1
case, 1
of, 1
coffee,, 1
and, 1
another, 1
of, 1
tobacco, 1
for, 1
me!", 1
"There,, 1
you, 1
see,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Danglars., 1
"Now, 1
the, 1
mischief, 1
is, 1
out;, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
the, 1
custom-house, 1
people, 1
went, 1
rummaging, 1
about, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
in, 1
our, 1
absence,, 1
and, 1
discovered, 1
poor, 1
Dantes', 1
hidden, 1
treasures.", 1
Mercedes,, 1
however,, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
heed, 1
to, 1
this, 1
explanation, 1
of, 1
her, 1
lover's, 1
arrest., 1
Her, 1
grief,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
restrain,, 1
now, 1
burst, 1
out, 1
in, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
hysterical, 1
sobbing., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"be, 1
comforted,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
child;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
still, 1
hope!", 1
"Hope!", 1
repeated, 1
Danglars., 1
"Hope!", 1
faintly, 1
murmured, 1
Fernand,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
word, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
die, 1
away, 1
on, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
agitated, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
convulsive, 1
spasm, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
countenance., 1
"Good, 1
news!, 1
good, 1
news!", 1
shouted, 1
forth, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
party, 1
stationed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
balcony, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lookout., 1
"Here, 1
comes, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
back., 1
No, 1
doubt,, 1
now,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
hear, 1
that, 1
our, 1
friend, 1
is, 1
released!", 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
rushed, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
shipowner, 1
and, 1
greeted, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
He, 1
was, 1
very, 1
pale., 1
"What, 1
news?", 1
exclaimed, 1
a, 1
general, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
voices., 1
"Alas,, 1
my, 1
friends,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mournful, 1
shake, 1
of, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
"the, 1
thing, 1
has, 1
assumed, 1
a, 1
more, 1
serious, 1
aspect, 1
than, 1
I, 1
expected.", 1
"Oh,, 1
indeed--indeed,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
innocent!", 1
sobbed, 1
forth, 1
Mercedes., 1
"That, 1
I, 1
believe!", 1
answered, 1
M., 1
Morrel;, 1
"but, 1
still, 1
he, 1
is, 1
charged"--, 1
"With, 1
what?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
Dantes., 1
"With, 1
being, 1
an, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Bonapartist, 1
faction!", 1
Many, 1
of, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
may, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
recollect, 1
how, 1
formidable, 1
such, 1
an, 1
accusation, 1
became, 1
in, 1
the, 1
period, 1
at, 1
which, 1
our, 1
story, 1
is, 1
dated., 1
A, 1
despairing, 1
cry, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
Mercedes;, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
sank, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
"Ah,, 1
Danglars!", 1
whispered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
deceived, 1
me--the, 1
trick, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1
last, 1
night, 1
has, 1
been, 1
played;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
suffer, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
man, 1
or, 1
an, 1
innocent, 1
girl, 1
to, 1
die, 1
of, 1
grief, 1
through, 1
your, 1
fault., 1
I, 1
am, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
them, 1
all, 1
about, 1
it.", 1
"Be, 1
silent,, 1
you, 1
simpleton!", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1

him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arm,, 1
"or, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
answer, 1
even, 1
for, 1
your, 1
own, 1
safety., 1
Who, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
whether, 1
Dantes, 1
be, 1
innocent, 1
or, 1
guilty?, 1
The, 1
vessel, 1
did, 1
touch, 1
at, 1
Elba,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
whole, 1
day, 1
in, 1
the, 1
island., 1
Now,, 1
should, 1
any, 1
letters, 1
or, 1
other, 1
documents, 1
of, 1
a, 1
compromising, 1
character, 1
be, 1
found, 1
upon, 1

taken, 1
for, 1
granted, 1
that, 1
all, 1
who, 1

him, 1
are, 1
his, 1
accomplices?", 1
With, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
instinct, 1
of, 1
selfishness,, 1
Caderousse, 1
readily, 1
perceived, 1
the, 1
solidity, 1
of, 1
this, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
reasoning;, 1
he, 1
gazed,, 1
doubtfully,, 1
wistfully,, 1
on, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
caution, 1
supplanted, 1
generosity., 1
"Suppose, 1
we, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
while,, 1
and, 1
see, 1
what, 1
comes, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
casting, 1
a, 1
bewildered, 1
look, 1
on, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
"To, 1
be, 1
sure!", 1
answered, 1
Danglars., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
wait,, 1
by, 1
all, 1
means., 1
If, 1
he, 1
be, 1
innocent,, 1
of, 1
course, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty;, 1
if, 1
guilty,, 1
why,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
use, 1
involving, 1
ourselves, 1
in, 1
a, 1
conspiracy.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
go,, 1
then., 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
stay, 1
here, 1
any, 1
longer.", 1
"With, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart!", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
other, 1
so, 1
tractable., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
take, 1
ourselves, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
leave, 1
things, 1
for, 1
the, 1
present, 1
to, 1
take, 1
their, 1
course.", 1
After, 1
their, 1
departure,, 1
Fernand,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
now, 1
again, 1
become, 1
the, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
protector, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
led, 1
the, 1
girl, 1
to, 1
her, 1
home,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
friends, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
conducted, 1
the, 1
now, 1
half-fainting, 1
man, 1
back, 1
to, 1
his, 1
abode., 1
The, 1
rumor, 1
of, 1
Edmond's, 1
arrest, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist, 1
agent, 1
was, 1
not, 1
slow, 1
in, 1
circulating, 1
throughout, 1
the, 1
city., 1
"Could, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
have, 1
credited, 1
such, 1
a, 1
thing,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Danglars?", 1
asked, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
as,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
port, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
gleaning, 1
fresh, 1
tidings, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
from, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
the, 1
assistant, 1
procureur,, 1
he, 1
overtook, 1
his, 1
supercargo, 1
and, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
believed, 1
such, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
possible?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
circumstance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
having, 1
anchored, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba, 1
as, 1
a, 1
very, 1
suspicious, 1
circumstance.", 1
"And, 1
did, 1
you, 1
mention, 1
these, 1
suspicions, 1
to, 1
any, 1
person, 1
beside, 1
myself?", 1
"Certainly, 1
not!", 1
returned, 1
Danglars., 1
Then, 1
added, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
whisper,, 1
"You, 1
understand, 1
that,, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
your, 1
uncle,, 1
M., 1
Policar, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
served, 1
under, 1
the, 1
other, 1
government,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
does, 1
not, 1
altogether, 1
conceal, 1
what, 1
he, 1
thinks, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
strongly, 1
suspected, 1
of, 1
regretting, 1
the, 1
abdication, 1
of, 1
Napoleon., 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
injure, 1
both, 1
Edmond, 1
and, 1
yourself,, 1
had, 1
I, 1
divulged, 1
my, 1
own, 1
apprehensions, 1
to, 1
a, 1
soul., 1
I, 1
am, 1
too, 1
well, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
though, 1
a, 1
subordinate,, 1
like, 1
myself,, 1
is, 1
bound, 1
to, 1
acquaint, 1
the, 1
shipowner, 1
with, 1
everything, 1
that, 1
occurs,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
many, 1
things, 1
he, 1
ought, 1
most, 1
carefully, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
from, 1
all, 1
else.", 1
"'Tis, 1
well,, 1
Danglars--'tis, 1
well!", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
Morrel., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
fellow;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
already, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
your, 1
interests, 1
in, 1
the, 1
event, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Edmond, 1
having, 1
become, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
you, 1
were, 1
so, 1
kind?", 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed;, 1
I, 1
had, 1
previously, 1
inquired, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
what, 1
was, 1
his, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
should, 1
have, 1
any, 1
reluctance, 1
to, 1
continue, 1
you, 1
in, 1
your, 1
post,, 1
for, 1
somehow, 1
I, 1
have, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
coolness, 1
between, 1
you.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
was, 1
his, 1
reply?", 1
"That, 1
he, 1
certainly, 1
did, 1
think, 1
he, 1
had, 1
given, 1
you, 1
offence, 1
in, 1
an, 1
affair, 1
which, 1
he, 1
merely, 1
referred, 1
to, 1
without, 1
entering, 1
into, 1
particulars,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
whoever, 1
possessed, 1
the, 1
good, 1
opinion, 1
and, 1
confidence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ship's, 1
owner, 1
would, 1
have, 1
his, 1
preference, 1
also.", 1
"The, 1
hypocrite!", 1
murmured, 1
Danglars., 1
"Poor, 1
Dantes!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"No, 1
one, 1
can, 1
deny, 1
his, 1
being, 1
a, 1
noble-hearted, 1
young, 1
fellow.", 1
"But, 1
meanwhile,", 1
continued, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
without, 1
a, 1
captain.", 1
"Oh,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
"since, 1
we, 1
cannot, 1
leave, 1
this, 1
port, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
three, 1
months,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
hope, 1
that, 1
ere, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
that, 1
period, 1
Dantes, 1
will, 1
be, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty.", 1
"No, 1
doubt;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
meantime?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
entirely, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
answered, 1
Danglars., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
as, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
managing, 1
a, 1
ship, 1
as, 1
the, 1
most, 1
experienced, 1
captain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
service;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
so, 1
far, 1
advantageous, 1
to, 1
you, 1
to, 1
accept, 1
my, 1
services,, 1
that, 1
upon, 1
Edmond's, 1
release, 1
from, 1
prison, 1
no, 1
further, 1
change, 1
will, 1
be, 1
requisite, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
than, 1
for, 1
Dantes, 1
and, 1
myself, 1
each, 1
to, 1
resume, 1
our, 1
respective, 1
posts.", 1
"Thanks,, 1
Danglars--that, 1
will, 1
smooth, 1
over, 1
all, 1
difficulties., 1
I, 1
fully, 1
authorize, 1
you, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
command, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
and, 1
look, 1
carefully, 1
to, 1
the, 1
unloading, 1
of, 1
her, 1
freight., 1
Private, 1
misfortunes, 1
must, 1
never, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
business.", 1
"Be, 1
easy, 1
on, 1
that, 1
score,, 1
M., 1
Morrel;, 1
but, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
see, 1
our, 1
poor, 1
Edmond?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
let, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
directly, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
Edmond's, 1
favor., 1
I, 1
am, 1
aware, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
furious, 1
royalist;, 1
but,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
his, 1
being, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
man, 1
like, 1
ourselves,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
fancy, 1
not, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
one.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
not,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
ambitious,, 1
and, 1
that's, 1
rather, 1
against, 1
him.", 1
"Well,, 1
well,", 1
returned, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
"we, 1
shall, 1
see., 1
But, 1
now, 1
hasten, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
join, 1
you, 1
there, 1
ere, 1
long.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
shipowner, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
two, 1
allies,, 1
and, 1
proceeded, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice., 1
"You, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
addressing, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"the, 1
turn, 1
things, 1
have, 1
taken., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
feel, 1
any, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
defence?", 1
"Not, 1
the, 1
slightest,, 1
but, 1
yet, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
a, 1
shocking, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
joke, 1
should, 1
lead, 1
to, 1
such, 1
consequences.", 1
"But, 1
who, 1
perpetrated, 1
that, 1
joke,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
ask?, 1
neither, 1
you, 1
nor, 1
myself,, 1
but, 1
Fernand;, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
very, 1
well, 1
that, 1
I, 1
threw, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
into, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room--indeed,, 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
I, 1
had, 1
destroyed, 1
it.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
can, 1
answer, 1
for,, 1

did, 1
not., 1
I, 1
only, 1
wish, 1
I, 1
could, 1
see, 1
it, 1
now, 1
as, 1
plainly, 1
as, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
lying, 1
all, 1
crushed, 1

crumpled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1

"Well,, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
did,, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
it,, 1
Fernand, 1
picked, 1
it, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
either, 1
copied, 1
it, 1
or, 1
caused, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
copied;, 1
perhaps,, 1
even,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
take, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
of, 1
recopying, 1
it., 1
And, 1
now, 1
I, 1
think, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
by, 1
Heavens,, 1
he, 1
may, 1
have, 1
sent, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
itself!, 1
Fortunately,, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
the, 1
handwriting, 1
was, 1
disguised.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
were, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
being, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
a, 1
conspiracy?", 1
"Not, 1
I., 1
As, 1
I, 1
before, 1
said,, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
thing, 1
was, 1
a, 1
joke,, 1
nothing, 1
more., 1
It, 1
seems,, 1
however,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
unconsciously, 1
stumbled, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
truth.", 1
"Still,", 1
argued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
give, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
if, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1

kind, 1
had, 1
happened;, 1

at, 1
least,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
had, 1
no, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
it., 1
You, 1
will, 1
see,, 1
Danglars,, 1

it, 1
will, 1
turn, 1
out, 1
an, 1
unlucky, 1

of, 1
us.", 1
"Nonsense!, 1

any, 1
harm, 1
come, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
it, 1
should, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
the, 1
guilty, 1
person;, 1
and, 1
that,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
is, 1
Fernand., 1
How, 1
can, 1
we, 1
be, 1
implicated, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way?, 1
All, 1
we, 1
have, 1
got, 1
to, 1
do, 1

to, 1
keep, 1
our, 1
own, 1
counsel,, 1

remain, 1
perfectly, 1
quiet,, 1
not, 1
breathing, 1
a, 1
word, 1
to, 1
any, 1
living, 1
soul;, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
that, 1
the, 1
storm, 1
will, 1
pass, 1
away, 1
without, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
affecting, 1
us.", 1
"Amen!", 1
responded, 1
Caderousse,, 1
waving, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
adieu, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
bending, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
moving, 1
his, 1
head, 1
to, 1

fro,, 1

he, 1
went,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
one, 1
whose, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
overcharged, 1
with, 1
one, 1
absorbing, 1
idea., 1
"So, 1
far,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
mentally,, 1
"all, 1
has, 1
gone, 1
as, 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
it., 1

he, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1

So, 1
saying,, 1

leaped, 1
into, 1

"Bravo,, 1
Villefort!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
marquis;, 1
"excellently, 1
well, 1
said!, 1
Come,, 1
now,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
obtaining, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
for, 1
years, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
persuade, 1
the, 1
marquise, 1
to, 1
promise;, 1

a, 1
perfect, 1
amnesty, 1
and, 1
forgetfulness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past.", 1
"With, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart,", 1

the, 1
marquise;, 1
"let, 1
the, 1
past, 1
be, 1
forever, 1

I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
it, 1
affords, 1
me, 1
as, 1
little, 1
pleasure, 1
to, 1
revive, 1
it, 1
as, 1
it, 1
does, 1
you., 1
All, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
will, 1
be, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
inflexible, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future, 1
in, 1
his, 1
political, 1
principles., 1
Remember,, 1
also,, 1
Villefort,, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
pledged, 1
ourselves, 1
to, 1
his, 1
majesty, 1
for, 1
your, 1
fealty, 1
and, 1
strict, 1
loyalty,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
at, 1
our, 1
recommendation, 1
the, 1
king, 1
consented, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do", 1
(and, 1
here, 1
she, 1
extended, 1
to, 1
him, 1
her, 1
hand)--"as, 1
I, 1
now, 1
do, 1
at, 1
your, 1
entreaty., 1

bear, 1
in, 1
mind,, 1
that, 1
should, 1
there, 1
fall, 1
in, 1
your, 1
way, 1

guilty, 1
of, 1

rigorous, 1
punishment,, 1

"Alas,, 1

returned, 1
Villefort,, 1
"my, 1
profession,, 1

well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
times, 1
in, 1
which, 1
we, 1
live,, 1
compels, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
severe., 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
successfully, 1
conducted, 1
several, 1
public, 1

brought, 1
the, 1
offenders, 1

merited, 1
punishment., 1

not, 1
done, 1

thing, 1
yet.", 1
"Do, 1
you,, 1
indeed,, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
marquise., 1
"I, 1
am,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
fearful, 1
of, 1
it., 1
Napoleon,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
is, 1
too, 1
near, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
proximity, 1
keeps, 1
up, 1
the, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
partisans., 1
Marseilles, 1
is, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
half-pay, 1
officers,, 1

are, 1
daily,, 1
under, 1
one, 1
frivolous, 1
pretext, 1

other,, 1
getting, 1
up, 1
quarrels, 1
with, 1
the, 1
royalists;, 1

continual, 1
and, 1
fatal, 1
duels, 1
among, 1

higher, 1
classes, 1
of, 1
persons,, 1
and, 1
assassinations, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lower.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
heard,, 1
perhaps,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
de, 1
Salvieux,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
oldest, 1
friends,, 1
and, 1
chamberlain, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
d'Artois,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
Alliance, 1
purpose, 1
removing, 1
him, 1
from, 1
thence?", 1
"Yes;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
talking, 1
about, 1
it, 1
when, 1
we, 1
left, 1
Paris,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran;, 1
"and, 1
where, 1
is, 1
it, 1
decided, 1
to, 1
transfer, 1
him?", 1
"To, 1
Saint, 1
Helena.", 1
"For, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
where, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
marquise., 1
"An, 1
island, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
equator,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
two, 1
thousand, 1
leagues, 1
from, 1
here,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better., 1
As, 1
Villefort, 1
observes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
great, 1
act, 1
of, 1
folly, 1
to, 1
have, 1
left, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
between, 1
Corsica,, 1

he, 1
was, 1
born,, 1

of, 1

with, 1

"Unfortunately,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
the, 1
treaties, 1
of, 1
1814,, 1

we, 1
cannot, 1
molest, 1
Napoleon, 1

breaking, 1
those, 1
compacts.", 1
"Oh,, 1
well,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
some, 1
way, 1
out, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
responded, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Salvieux., 1
"There, 1
wasn't, 1
any, 1
trouble, 1
over, 1
treaties, 1

it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
question, 1
of, 1
shooting, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
Duc, 1
d'Enghien.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
marquise,, 1
"it, 1
seems, 1
probable, 1
that,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
Alliance,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
Napoleon;, 1

we, 1
must, 1
trust, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vigilance, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
purify, 1
Marseilles, 1
of, 1

a, 1
king, 1

no, 1
king;, 1
if, 1
he, 1
be, 1
acknowledged, 1
as, 1
sovereign, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
upheld, 1
in, 1
peace, 1
and, 1
tranquillity;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
can, 1
best, 1
be, 1
effected, 1
by, 1
employing, 1
the, 1
most, 1
inflexible, 1
agents, 1
to, 1
put, 1
down, 1
every, 1
attempt, 1
at, 1

best, 1
and, 1
surest, 1
means, 1
of, 1
preventing, 1
mischief.", 1
"Unfortunately,, 1
madame,", 1
answered, 1
Villefort,, 1
"the, 1
strong, 1
arm, 1
of, 1

a, 1

the, 1

"Well,", 1

Renee,, 1
"I, 1

for, 1

Do, 1
you, 1

always, 1
felt, 1
a, 1

angel?", 1
"Dear,, 1
good, 1

whispered, 1
Villefort,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
with, 1
unutterable, 1
tenderness, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
speaker., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
hope,, 1
my, 1
child,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
"that, 1
M., 1

will, 1
go, 1
far, 1
to, 1
efface, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
his, 1

conduct,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
incorrigible, 1
marquise., 1
"Madame,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mournful, 1
smile,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
that, 1
my, 1
father, 1
has--at, 1
least,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
so--abjured, 1
his, 1
past, 1
errors,, 1

that, 1
he, 1

a, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
zealous, 1
friend, 1
to, 1

better, 1
royalist,, 1
possibly,, 1
than, 1

for, 1
he, 1
has, 1
to, 1
atone, 1
for, 1
past, 1
dereliction,, 1

decided, 1
preference, 1
and, 1
conviction.", 1
Having, 1
made, 1
this, 1
well-turned, 1
speech,, 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
carefully, 1
around, 1
to, 1
mark, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
his, 1
oratory,, 1
much, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
had, 1
he, 1
been, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
bench, 1
in, 1
open, 1
court., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Villefort,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
de, 1
Salvieux,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
exactly, 1
what, 1
I, 1
myself, 1
said, 1
the, 1
other, 1
day, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Tuileries,, 1
when, 1
questioned, 1
by, 1
his, 1
majesty's, 1
principal, 1
chamberlain, 1
touching, 1
the, 1
singularity, 1
of, 1
an, 1
alliance, 1
between, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Girondin, 1
and, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
officer, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Duc, 1
de, 1
Conde;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
fully, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
that, 1
this, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
reconciling, 1
political, 1
differences, 1
was, 1
based, 1
upon, 1
sound, 1
and, 1
excellent, 1
principles., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
who,, 1
without, 1
our, 1
suspecting, 1
it,, 1
had, 1
overheard, 1
our, 1
conversation,, 1
interrupted, 1
us, 1
by, 1
saying,, 1
'Villefort'--observe, 1
that, 1
the, 1
king, 1
did, 1
not, 1
pronounce, 1
the, 1
word, 1
Noirtier,, 1
but,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
placed, 1
considerable, 1
emphasis, 1
on, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Villefort--'Villefort,', 1
said, 1
his, 1
majesty,, 1
'is, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
great, 1
judgment, 1
and, 1
discretion,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
figure, 1
in, 1
his, 1
profession;, 1
I, 1
like, 1
him, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
great, 1
pleasure, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
become, 1
the, 1
son-in-law, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Marquis, 1
and, 1
Marquise, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran., 1
I, 1
should, 1
myself, 1
have, 1
recommended, 1
the, 1
match,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
noble, 1
marquis, 1
anticipated, 1
my, 1
wishes, 1
by, 1
requesting, 1
my, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
it.'", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
the, 1
king, 1
could, 1
have, 1
condescended, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
express, 1
himself, 1
so, 1
favorably, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
enraptured, 1
Villefort., 1
"I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
his, 1
very, 1
words;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
the, 1
marquis, 1
chooses, 1
to, 1
be, 1
candid,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
confess, 1
that, 1
they, 1
perfectly, 1
agree, 1
with, 1
what, 1
his, 1
majesty, 1
said, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
went, 1
six, 1
months, 1
ago, 1
to, 1
consult, 1
him, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
your, 1
espousing, 1
his, 1
daughter.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
true,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
marquis., 1
"How, 1
much, 1
do, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
this, 1
gracious, 1
prince!, 1
What, 1
is, 1
there, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
do, 1
to, 1
evince, 1
my, 1
earnest, 1
gratitude!", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
right,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
marquise., 1
"I, 1

you, 1

would, 1
be, 1
most, 1
welcome.", 1
"For, 1
my, 1
part,, 1
dear, 1
mother.", 1
interposed, 1
Renee,, 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
your, 1
wishes, 1
will, 1
not, 1
prosper,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
Providence, 1
will, 1
only, 1
permit, 1
petty, 1
offenders,, 1
poor, 1
debtors,, 1
and, 1
miserable, 1
cheats, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
hands,--then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
contented.", 1
"Just, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
though, 1
you, 1
prayed, 1
that, 1
a, 1
physician, 1
might, 1
only, 1
be, 1
called, 1
upon, 1
to, 1
prescribe, 1
for, 1
headaches,, 1
measles,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
stings, 1
of, 1
wasps,, 1
or, 1
any, 1
other, 1
slight, 1
affection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
epidermis., 1
If, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
desire, 1
for, 1
me, 1
some, 1
of, 1
those, 1
violent, 1
and, 1
dangerous, 1
diseases, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cure, 1
of, 1

so, 1
much, 1
honor, 1
redounds, 1
to, 1

physician.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
though, 1
the, 1
utterance, 1
of, 1
Villefort's, 1
wish, 1
had, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
effect, 1
its, 1
accomplishment,, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ear., 1
Villefort, 1
immediately, 1
rose, 1
from, 1
table, 1
and, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
room, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
plea, 1
of, 1
urgent, 1
business;, 1
he, 1
soon,, 1
however,, 1
returned,, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
face, 1
beaming, 1
with, 1
delight., 1
Renee, 1
regarded, 1
him, 1
with, 1
fond, 1
affection;, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
his, 1
handsome, 1
features,, 1
lit, 1
up, 1
as, 1
they, 1
then, 1
were, 1
with, 1
more, 1
than, 1
usual, 1
fire, 1
and, 1
animation,, 1
seemed, 1
formed, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
the, 1
innocent, 1
admiration, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
her, 1
graceful, 1
and, 1
intelligent, 1
lover., 1
"You, 1
were, 1
wishing, 1
just, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
addressing, 1
her,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
were, 1
a, 1
doctor, 1
instead, 1
of, 1

Well,, 1
I, 1
at, 1

resemble, 1

disciples, 1
of, 1
Esculapius, 1
in, 1
one, 1
thing--that, 1
of, 1

"And, 1
wherefore, 1
were, 1
you, 1
called, 1
away, 1
just, 1
now?", 1
asked, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
interest., 1
"For, 1
a, 1
very, 1
serious, 1
matter,, 1
which, 1
bids, 1
fair, 1
to, 1
make, 1
work, 1
for, 1
the, 1
executioner.", 1
"How, 1
dreadful!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Renee,, 1
turning, 1
pale., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible?", 1
burst, 1
simultaneously, 1
from, 1
all, 1
who, 1
were, 1
near, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
his, 1
words., 1
"Why,, 1

son-in-law's, 1
respectful, 1
salute, 1
on, 1
it,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Renee,, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
try, 1
and, 1
fancy, 1
'tis, 1
your, 1
dear, 1
hand, 1
I, 1
kiss,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been.", 1
"These, 1
are, 1
mournful, 1
auspices, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
a, 1
betrothal,", 1
sighed, 1
poor, 1
Renee., 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
child!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
angry, 1
marquise,, 1
"your, 1
folly, 1
exceeds, 1
all, 1
bounds., 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
connection, 1
there, 1
can, 1
possibly, 1
be, 1
between, 1
your, 1
sickly, 1
sentimentality, 1
and, 1
the, 1
affairs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
state!", 1
"O, 1
mother!", 1
murmured, 1
Renee., 1
"Nay,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
you, 1
pardon, 1
this, 1
little, 1
traitor., 1
I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
that, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
for, 1
her, 1
want, 1
of, 1
loyalty,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
most, 1
inflexibly, 1
severe;", 1
then, 1
casting, 1
an, 1
expressive, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
his, 1
betrothed,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"Fear, 1
not,, 1
for, 1
your, 1
dear, 1
sake, 1
my, 1
justice, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
tempered, 1
with, 1
mercy,", 1
and, 1
receiving, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
and, 1
approving, 1
smile, 1
in, 1
return,, 1
Villefort, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Chapter, 1
7., 1
The, 1
Examination., 1
No, 1
sooner, 1
had, 1
Villefort, 1
left, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
than, 1
he, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
holds, 1
the, 1
balance, 1
of, 1
life, 1
and, 1
death, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
Now,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nobility, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance,, 1
the, 1
command, 1
of, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
finished, 1
actor,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
carefully, 1
studied, 1
before, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
easy, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
judicial, 1
severity., 1
Except, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
line, 1
of, 1
politics, 1
his, 1
father, 1
had, 1
adopted,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
might, 1
interfere,, 1
unless, 1
he, 1
acted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
prudence,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own, 1
career,, 1
Gerard, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
as, 1
happy, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
could, 1
be., 1
Already, 1
rich,, 1
he, 1
held, 1
a, 1
high, 1
official, 1
situation,, 1
though, 1
only, 1
twenty-seven., 1
He, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
charming, 1
woman,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
loved,, 1
not, 1
passionately,, 1
but, 1
reasonably,, 1
as, 1
became, 1
a, 1
deputy, 1
attorney, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king;, 1
and, 1
besides, 1
her, 1
personal, 1
attractions,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
very, 1
great,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
family, 1
possessed, 1
considerable, 1
political, 1
influence,, 1
which, 1
they, 1
would,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
exert, 1
in, 1
his, 1
favor., 1
The, 1
dowry, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
crowns,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had,, 1
besides,, 1
the, 1
prospect, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
her, 1
fortune, 1
increased, 1
to, 1
half, 1
a, 1
million, 1
at, 1
her, 1
father's, 1
death., 1
These, 1
considerations, 1
naturally, 1
gave, 1
Villefort, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
such, 1
complete, 1
felicity, 1
that, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
fairly, 1
dazzled, 1
in, 1
its, 1
contemplation., 1
At, 1
the, 1
door, 1
he, 1
met, 1
the, 1
commissary, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him., 1
The, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
this, 1
officer, 1
recalled, 1
Villefort, 1
from, 1
the, 1
third, 1
heaven, 1
to, 1
earth;, 1
he, 1
composed, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
described,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
acted, 1
rightly, 1
in, 1
arresting, 1
this, 1
man;, 1
now, 1
inform, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
concerning, 1
him, 1
and, 1
the, 1
conspiracy.", 1
"We, 1
know, 1
nothing, 1
as, 1
yet, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conspiracy,, 1
monsieur;, 1
all, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
found, 1
have, 1
been, 1
sealed, 1
up, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
your, 1
desk., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
himself, 1
is, 1
named, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,, 1
mate, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
three-master, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
trading, 1
in, 1
cotton, 1
with, 1
Alexandria, 1
and, 1
Smyrna,, 1
and, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son,, 1
of, 1
Marseilles.", 1
"Before, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
merchant, 1
service,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
ever, 1
served, 1
in, 1
the, 1
marines?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
monsieur,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
very, 1
young.", 1
"How, 1
old?", 1
"Nineteen, 1
or, 1
twenty, 1
at, 1
the, 1
most.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
des, 1
Conseils,, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
approached;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
M., 1
Morrel., 1
"Ah,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you., 1
Some, 1
of, 1
your, 1
people, 1
have, 1
committed, 1
the, 1
strangest, 1
mistake--they, 1
have, 1
just, 1
arrested, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,, 1
mate, 1
of, 1
my, 1
vessel.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
now, 1
going, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
him.", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
carried, 1
away, 1
by, 1
his, 1
friendship,, 1
"you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do., 1
He, 1
is, 1
the, 1
most, 1
estimable,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
trustworthy, 1
creature, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
better, 1
seaman, 1
in, 1
all, 1
the, 1
merchant, 1
service., 1
Oh,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
your, 1
indulgence, 1
for, 1
him.", 1
Villefort,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
seen,, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
party, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
the, 1
plebeian;, 1
the, 1
first, 1
was, 1
a, 1
royalist,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
suspected, 1
of, 1
Bonapartism., 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
disdainfully, 1
at, 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
replied,--, 1
"You, 1
are, 1
aware,, 1
monsieur,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
may, 1
be, 1
estimable, 1
and, 1
trustworthy, 1
in, 1
private, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
best, 1
seaman, 1
in, 1
the, 1
merchant, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
be,, 1
politically, 1
speaking,, 1
a, 1
great, 1
criminal., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
true?", 1
The, 1
magistrate, 1
laid, 1
emphasis, 1
on, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
apply, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
himself,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
plunge, 1
into, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
one, 1
who,, 1
interceding, 1
for, 1
another,, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
need, 1
of, 1
indulgence., 1
Morrel, 1
reddened,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
own, 1
conscience, 1
was, 1
not, 1
quite, 1
clear, 1
on, 1
politics;, 1
besides,, 1
what, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
told, 1
him, 1
of, 1
his, 1
interview, 1
with, 1
the, 1
grand-marshal,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
had, 1
said, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
embarrassed, 1
him., 1
He, 1
replied,, 1
however,--, 1
"I, 1
entreat, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
be,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
always, 1
are,, 1
kind, 1
and, 1
equitable,, 1
and, 1
give, 1
him, 1
back, 1
to, 1
us, 1
soon.", 1
This, 1
give, 1
us, 1
sounded, 1
revolutionary, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deputy's, 1
ears., 1
"Ah,, 1
ah,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
"is, 1
Dantes, 1
then, 1
a, 1
member, 1
of, 1
some, 1
Carbonari, 1
society,, 1
that, 1
his, 1
protector, 1
thus, 1
employs, 1
the, 1
collective, 1
form?, 1
He, 1
was,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
recollect,, 1
arrested, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tavern,, 1
in, 1
company, 1
with, 1
a, 1
great, 1
many, 1
others.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"Monsieur,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
rest, 1
assured, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
perform, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
impartially,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
if, 1
he, 1
be, 1
innocent, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
have, 1
appealed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
in, 1
vain;, 1
should, 1
he,, 1
however,, 1
be, 1
guilty,, 1
in, 1
this, 1
present, 1
epoch,, 1
impunity, 1
would, 1
furnish, 1
a, 1
dangerous, 1
example,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
must, 1
do, 1
my, 1
duty.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
had, 1
now, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
adjoined, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice,, 1
he, 1
entered,, 1
after, 1
having,, 1
coldly, 1
saluted, 1
the, 1
shipowner,, 1
who, 1
stood,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
petrified,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him., 1
The, 1
ante-chamber, 1
was, 1
full, 1
of, 1
police, 1
agents, 1
and, 1
gendarmes,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
whom,, 1
carefully, 1
watched,, 1
but, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
smiling,, 1
stood, 1
the, 1
prisoner., 1
Villefort, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
side, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
which, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
offered, 1
him,, 1
disappeared,, 1
saying,, 1
"Bring, 1
in, 1
the, 1
prisoner.", 1
Rapid, 1
as, 1
had, 1
been, 1
Villefort's, 1
glance,, 1
it, 1
had, 1
served, 1
to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
interrogate., 1
He, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
intelligence, 1
in, 1
the, 1
high, 1
forehead,, 1
courage, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
eye, 1
and, 1
bent, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
frankness, 1
in, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
lips, 1
that, 1
showed, 1
a, 1
set, 1
of, 1
pearly, 1
teeth., 1
Villefort's, 1
first, 1
impression, 1
was, 1
favorable;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
often, 1
warned, 1
to, 1
mistrust, 1
first, 1
impulses,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
applied, 1
the, 1
maxim, 1
to, 1
the, 1
impression,, 1
forgetting, 1
the, 1
difference, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
words., 1
He, 1
stifled,, 1
therefore,, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
of, 1
compassion, 1
that, 1
were, 1
rising,, 1
composed, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
and, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
grim, 1
and, 1
sombre,, 1
at, 1
his, 1
desk., 1
An, 1
instant, 1
after, 1
Dantes, 1
entered., 1
He, 1
was, 1
pale,, 1
but, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
collected,, 1
and, 1
saluting, 1
his, 1
judge, 1
with, 1
easy, 1
politeness,, 1
looked, 1
round, 1
for, 1
a, 1
seat,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
M., 1
Morrel's, 1
salon., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
that, 1
he, 1
encountered, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
Villefort's, 1
look,--that, 1
look, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
who,, 1
while, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
read, 1
the, 1
thoughts, 1
of, 1
others,, 1
betrays, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own., 1
"Who, 1
and, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
demanded, 1
Villefort,, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
a, 1
pile, 1
of, 1
papers,, 1
containing, 1
information, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
police, 1
agent, 1
had, 1
given, 1
to, 1
him, 1
on, 1
his, 1
entry,, 1
and, 1
that,, 1
already,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
hour's, 1
time,, 1
had, 1
swelled, 1
to, 1
voluminous, 1
proportions,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
corrupt, 1
espionage, 1
of, 1
which, 1
"the, 1
accused", 1
is, 1
always, 1
made, 1
the, 1
victim., 1
"My, 1
name, 1
is, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
calmly;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
mate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
Messrs., 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son.", 1
"Your, 1
age?", 1
continued, 1
Villefort., 1
"Nineteen,", 1
returned, 1
Dantes., 1
"What, 1
were, 1
you, 1
doing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
you, 1
were, 1
arrested?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
festival, 1
of, 1
my, 1
marriage,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
slightly, 1
tremulous,, 1
so, 1
great, 1
was, 1
the, 1
contrast, 1
between, 1
that, 1
happy, 1
moment, 1
and, 1
the, 1
painful, 1
ceremony, 1
he, 1
was, 1
now, 1
undergoing;, 1
so, 1
great, 1
was, 1
the, 1
contrast, 1
between, 1
the, 1
sombre, 1
aspect, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
the, 1
radiant, 1
face, 1
of, 1
Mercedes., 1
"You, 1
were, 1
at, 1
the, 1
festival, 1
of, 1
your, 1
marriage?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
deputy,, 1
shuddering, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
himself., 1
"Yes,, 1
monsieur;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
for, 1
three, 1
years.", 1
Villefort,, 1
impassive, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
was, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
this, 1
coincidence;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tremulous, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
surprised, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
his, 1
happiness,, 1
struck, 1
a, 1
sympathetic, 1
chord, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
bosom--he, 1
also, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
being, 1
married,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
summoned, 1
from, 1
his, 1
own, 1
happiness, 1
to, 1
destroy, 1
that, 1
of, 1
another., 1
"This, 1
philosophic, 1
reflection,", 1
thought, 1
he,, 1
"will, 1
make, 1
a, 1
great, 1
sensation, 1
at, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
arranged, 1
mentally,, 1
while, 1
Dantes, 1
awaited, 1
further, 1
questions,, 1
the, 1
antithesis, 1
by, 1
which, 1
orators, 1
often, 1
create, 1
a, 1
reputation, 1
for, 1
eloquence., 1
When, 1
this, 1
speech, 1
was, 1
arranged,, 1
Villefort, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
"Go, 1
on,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"What, 1
would, 1
you, 1
have, 1
me, 1
say?", 1
"Give, 1
all, 1
the, 1
information, 1
in, 1
your, 1
power.", 1
"Tell, 1
me, 1
on, 1
which, 1
point, 1
you, 1
desire, 1
information,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
all, 1
I, 1
know;, 1
only,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"I, 1
warn, 1
you, 1
I, 1
know, 1
very, 1
little.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
served, 1
under, 1
the, 1
usurper?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
mustered, 1
into, 1
the, 1
Royal, 1
Marines, 1
when, 1
he, 1
fell.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
reported, 1
your, 1
political, 1
opinions, 1
are, 1
extreme,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kind,, 1
but, 1
was, 1
not, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
make, 1
this, 1
inquiry,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
an, 1
accusation., 1
"My, 1
political, 1
opinions!", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
"Alas,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
never, 1
had, 1
any, 1
opinions., 1
I, 1
am, 1
hardly, 1
nineteen;, 1
I, 1
know, 1
nothing;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
part, 1
to, 1
play., 1
If, 1
I, 1
obtain, 1
the, 1
situation, 1
I, 1
desire,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
owe, 1
it, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Morrel., 1
Thus, 1
all, 1
my, 1
opinions--I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
say, 1
public,, 1
but, 1
private--are, 1
confined, 1
to, 1
these, 1
three, 1
sentiments,--I, 1
love, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
I, 1
respect, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
adore, 1
Mercedes., 1
This,, 1
sir,, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
see, 1
how, 1
uninteresting, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
As, 1
Dantes, 1
spoke,, 1
Villefort, 1
gazed, 1
at, 1
his, 1
ingenuous, 1
and, 1
open, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
Renee,, 1
who,, 1
without, 1
knowing, 1
who, 1
the, 1
culprit, 1
was,, 1
had, 1
besought, 1
his, 1
indulgence, 1
for, 1
him., 1
With, 1
the, 1
deputy's, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
crime, 1
and, 1
criminals,, 1
every, 1
word, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
uttered, 1
convinced, 1
him, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
of, 1
his, 1
innocence., 1
This, 1
lad,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
a, 1
man,--simple,, 1
natural,, 1
eloquent, 1
with, 1
that, 1
eloquence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
never, 1
found, 1
when, 1
sought, 1
for;, 1
full, 1
of, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
everybody,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
was, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
because, 1
happiness, 1
renders, 1
even, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
good--extended, 1
his, 1
affection, 1
even, 1
to, 1
his, 1
judge,, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
Villefort's, 1
severe, 1
look, 1
and, 1
stern, 1
accent., 1
Dantes, 1
seemed, 1
full, 1
of, 1
kindness., 1
"Pardieu,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
noble, 1
fellow., 1
I, 1
hope, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
gain, 1
Renee's, 1
favor, 1
easily, 1
by, 1
obeying, 1
the, 1
first, 1
command, 1
she, 1
ever, 1
imposed, 1
on, 1
me., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
pressure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
public,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
kiss, 1
in, 1
private.", 1
Full, 1
of, 1
this, 1
idea,, 1
Villefort's, 1
face, 1
became, 1
so, 1
joyous,, 1
that, 1
when, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
change, 1
on, 1
his, 1
physiognomy,, 1
was, 1
smiling, 1
also., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
enemies,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
know.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
enemies?", 1
replied, 1
Dantes;, 1
"my, 1
position, 1
is, 1
not, 1
sufficiently, 1
elevated, 1
for, 1
that., 1
As, 1
for, 1
my, 1
disposition,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
perhaps,, 1
somewhat, 1
too, 1
hasty;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
striven, 1
to, 1
repress, 1
it., 1
I, 1
have, 1
had, 1
ten, 1
or, 1
twelve, 1
sailors, 1
under, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
question, 1
them,, 1
they, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
they, 1
love, 1
and, 1
respect, 1
me,, 1
not, 1
as, 1
a, 1
father,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
too, 1
young,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
an, 1
elder, 1
brother.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
may, 1
have, 1
excited, 1
jealousy., 1
You, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1
become, 1
captain, 1
at, 1
nineteen--an, 1
elevated, 1
post;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
loves, 1
you;, 1
and, 1
these, 1
two, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
may, 1
have, 1
excited, 1
the, 1
envy, 1
of, 1
some, 1
one.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
men, 1
better, 1
than, 1
I, 1
do,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
you, 1
say, 1
may, 1
possibly, 1
be, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
confess;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
such, 1
persons, 1
are, 1
among, 1
my, 1
acquaintances, 1
I, 1
prefer, 1
not, 1
to, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
because, 1
then, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
hate, 1
them.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
wrong;, 1
you, 1
should, 1
always, 1
strive, 1
to, 1
see, 1
clearly, 1
around, 1
you., 1
You, 1
seem, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
depart, 1
from, 1
the, 1
strict, 1
line, 1
of, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
you, 1
in, 1
discovering, 1
the, 1
author, 1
of, 1
this, 1
accusation., 1
Here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
paper;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
writing?", 1
As, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
Dantes, 1
read, 1
it., 1
A, 1
cloud, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
brow, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said,--, 1
"No,, 1
monsieur,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
the, 1
writing,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
it, 1
is, 1
tolerably, 1
plain., 1
Whoever, 1
did, 1
it, 1
writes, 1
well., 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
fortunate,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
looking, 1
gratefully, 1
at, 1
Villefort,, 1
"to, 1
be, 1
examined, 1
by, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
as, 1
you;, 1
for, 1
this, 1
envious, 1
person, 1
is, 1
a, 1
real, 1
enemy.", 1
And, 1
by, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
shot, 1
forth,, 1
Villefort, 1
saw, 1
how, 1
much, 1
energy, 1
lay, 1
hid, 1
beneath, 1
this, 1
mildness., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
deputy,, 1
"answer, 1
me, 1
frankly,, 1
not, 1
as, 1
a, 1
prisoner, 1
to, 1
a, 1
judge,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
one, 1
man, 1
to, 1
another, 1
who, 1
takes, 1
an, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
him,, 1
what, 1
truth, 1
is, 1
there, 1
in, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
this, 1
anonymous, 1
letter?", 1
And, 1
Villefort, 1
threw, 1
disdainfully, 1
on, 1
his, 1
desk, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
just, 1
given, 1
back, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"None, 1
at, 1
all., 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
real, 1
facts., 1
I, 1
swear, 1
by, 1
my, 1
honor, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sailor,, 1
by, 1
my, 1
love, 1
for, 1
Mercedes,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father"--, 1
"Speak,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
Then,, 1
internally,, 1
"If, 1
Renee, 1
could, 1
see, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
she, 1
would, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
call, 1
me, 1
a, 1
decapitator.", 1
"Well,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
quitted, 1
Naples,, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
was, 1
attacked, 1
with, 1

brain, 1

we, 1
had, 1
no, 1

was, 1
so, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1

at, 1
Elba,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
touch, 1
at, 1
any, 1
other, 1
port,, 1
his, 1
disorder, 1
rose, 1
to, 1

the, 1
end, 1
of, 1

went, 1
on, 1
shore, 1
alone., 1

some, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1

brought, 1
from, 1
Elba,, 1
and, 1
pass, 1
your, 1
word, 1
you, 1
will, 1
appear, 1
should, 1
you, 1
be, 1
required,, 1
and, 1
go, 1
and, 1
rejoin, 1
your, 1
friends., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
free,, 1
then,, 1
sir?", 1
cried, 1
Dantes, 1
joyfully., 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
first, 1
give, 1
me, 1
this, 1
letter.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
it, 1
already,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
from, 1
me, 1
with, 1
some, 1
others, 1
which, 1
I, 1
see, 1
in, 1
that, 1
packet.", 1
"Stop, 1
a, 1
moment,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
deputy,, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
and, 1
gloves., 1
"To, 1
whom, 1
is, 1
it, 1
addressed?", 1
"To, 1
Monsieur, 1
Noirtier,, 1
Rue, 1
Coq-Heron,, 1
Paris.", 1
Had, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
Villefort, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
more, 1
stupefied., 1
He, 1
sank, 1
into, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
hastily, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
packet,, 1
drew, 1
forth, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
letter,, 1
at, 1
which, 1
he, 1
glanced, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
terror., 1
"M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
Rue, 1
Coq-Heron,, 1
No., 1
13,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
growing, 1
still, 1
paler., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
him?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort;, 1
"a, 1
faithful, 1
servant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know, 1
conspirators.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
conspiracy,, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
after, 1
believing, 1
himself, 1
free,, 1
now, 1
began, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
a, 1
tenfold, 1
alarm., 1
"I, 1
have,, 1
however,, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
entirely, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
the, 1
letter.", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
it, 1
was, 1
addressed,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
read, 1
the, 1
address, 1
to, 1
know, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
to, 1
give, 1
it.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
shown, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort,, 1
becoming, 1
still, 1
more, 1
pale., 1
"To, 1
no, 1
one,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor.", 1
"Everybody, 1
is, 1
ignorant, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
bearer, 1
of, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
and, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"Everybody,, 1
except, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
that, 1
was, 1
too, 1
much,, 1
far, 1
too, 1
much,", 1
murmured, 1
Villefort., 1
Villefort's, 1
brow, 1
darkened, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more,, 1
his, 1
white, 1
lips, 1
and, 1
clinched, 1
teeth, 1
filled, 1
Dantes, 1
with, 1
apprehension., 1
After, 1
reading, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
Villefort, 1
covered, 1
his, 1
face, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Dantes, 1
timidly,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
Villefort, 1
made, 1
no, 1
answer,, 1
but, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
at, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
a, 1
few, 1
seconds,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
perused, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
this, 1
letter?", 1
"I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
my, 1
word, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"but, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
You, 1
are, 1
ill--shall, 1
I, 1
ring, 1
for, 1
assistance?--shall, 1
I, 1
call?", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
rising, 1
hastily;, 1
"stay, 1
where, 1
you, 1
are., 1
It, 1
is, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
give, 1
orders, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
you.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes, 1
proudly,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
to, 1
summon, 1
assistance, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
want, 1
none;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
temporary, 1
indisposition., 1
Attend, 1
to, 1
yourself;, 1
answer, 1
me.", 1
Dantes, 1
waited,, 1
expecting, 1
a, 1
question,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
Villefort, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
on, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
moist, 1
with, 1
perspiration,, 1
and,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time,, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"Oh,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
this!", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
Noirtier, 1
is, 1
the, 1
father, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
lost!", 1
And, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
Edmond, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
penetrated, 1
his, 1
thoughts., 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
doubt, 1
it,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
suddenly., 1
"In, 1
heaven's, 1
name!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
doubt, 1
me,, 1
question, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
you.", 1
Villefort, 1
made, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
he, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
render, 1
firm,--, 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
able,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
had, 1
hoped,, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
you, 1
immediately, 1
to, 1
liberty;, 1
before, 1
doing, 1
so,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
consult, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
justice;, 1
what, 1
my, 1
own, 1
feeling, 1
is, 1
you, 1
already, 1
know.", 1
"Oh,, 1
monsieur,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
than, 1
a, 1
judge.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
detain, 1
you, 1
some, 1
time, 1
longer,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
strive, 1
to, 1
make, 1
it, 1
as, 1
short, 1
as, 1
possible., 1
The, 1
principal, 1
charge, 1
against, 1
you, 1
is, 1
this, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
see"--Villefort, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
cast, 1
it, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
waited, 1
until, 1
it, 1
was, 1
entirely, 1
consumed., 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
I, 1
destroy, 1
it?", 1
"Oh,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
goodness, 1
itself.", 1
"Listen,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort;, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
now, 1
have, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
me, 1
after, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done.", 1
"Oh,, 1
command,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
obey.", 1
"Listen;, 1
this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
command,, 1
but, 1
advice, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you.", 1
"Speak,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
follow, 1
your, 1
advice.", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
detain, 1
you, 1
until, 1
this, 1
evening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice., 1
Should, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
interrogate, 1
you,, 1
say, 1
to, 1
him, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
said, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
do, 1
not, 1
breathe, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
this, 1
letter.", 1
"I, 1
promise.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
Villefort, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
entreat,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
who, 1
reassured, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
see,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
glancing, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
grate,, 1
where, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
burnt, 1
paper, 1
fluttered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
flames,, 1
"the, 1
letter, 1
is, 1
destroyed;, 1
you, 1
and, 1
I, 1
alone, 1
know, 1
of, 1
its, 1
existence;, 1
should, 1
you,, 1
therefore,, 1
be, 1
questioned,, 1
deny, 1
all, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
it--deny, 1
it, 1
boldly,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
saved.", 1
"Be, 1
satisfied;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
deny, 1
it.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
letter, 1
you, 1
had?", 1
"It, 1
was.", 1
"Swear, 1
it.", 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
it.", 1
Villefort, 1
rang., 1
A, 1
police, 1
agent, 1
entered., 1
Villefort, 1
whispered, 1
some, 1
words, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ear,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
motion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Follow, 1
him,", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
Dantes, 1
saluted, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
retired., 1
Hardly, 1
had, 1
the, 1
door, 1
closed, 1
when, 1
Villefort, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
half-fainting, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
"Alas,, 1
alas,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
"if, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
been, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
ruined., 1
This, 1
accursed, 1
letter, 1
would, 1
have, 1
destroyed, 1
all, 1
my, 1
hopes., 1
Oh,, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
must, 1
your, 1
past, 1
career, 1
always, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
my, 1
successes?", 1
Suddenly, 1
a, 1
light, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
played, 1
round, 1
his, 1
set, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
haggard, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
fixed, 1
in, 1
thought., 1
"This, 1
will, 1
do,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"and, 1
from, 1
this, 1
letter,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
have, 1
ruined, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
make, 1
my, 1
fortune., 1
Now, 1
to, 1
the, 1
work, 1
I, 1
have, 1
in, 1
hand.", 1
And, 1
after, 1
having, 1
assured, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
was, 1
gone,, 1
the, 1
deputy, 1
procureur, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
his, 1
betrothed., 1
Chapter, 1
8., 1
The, 1
Chateau, 1
D'If., 1
The, 1
commissary, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
two, 1
gendarmes,, 1
who, 1
placed, 1
themselves, 1
one, 1
on, 1
Dantes', 1
right, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
on, 1
his, 1
left., 1
A, 1
door, 1
that, 1
communicated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
went, 1
through, 1
a, 1
long, 1
range, 1
of, 1
gloomy, 1
corridors,, 1
whose, 1
appearance, 1
might, 1
have, 1
made, 1
even, 1
the, 1
boldest, 1
shudder., 1
The, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice, 1
communicated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
prison,--a, 1
sombre, 1
edifice,, 1
that, 1
from, 1
its, 1
grated, 1
windows, 1
looks, 1
on, 1
the, 1
clock-tower, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Accoules., 1
After, 1
numberless, 1
windings,, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
door, 1
with, 1
an, 1
iron, 1
wicket., 1
The, 1
commissary, 1
took, 1
up, 1
an, 1
iron, 1
mallet, 1
and, 1
knocked, 1
thrice,, 1
every, 1
blow, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
Dantes, 1
as, 1
if, 1
struck, 1
on, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
gendarmes, 1
gently, 1
pushed, 1
him, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door, 1
closed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
sound, 1
behind, 1
him., 1
The, 1
air, 1
he, 1
inhaled, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
pure,, 1
but, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
mephitic,--he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
prison., 1
He, 1
was, 1
conducted, 1
to, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
neat, 1
chamber,, 1
but, 1
grated, 1
and, 1
barred,, 1
and, 1
its, 1
appearance,, 1
therefore,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
greatly, 1
alarm, 1
him;, 1
besides,, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
interest, 1
himself, 1
so, 1
much,, 1
resounded, 1
still, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears, 1
like, 1
a, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
freedom., 1
It, 1
was, 1
four, 1
o'clock, 1
when, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
this, 1
chamber., 1
It, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
1st, 1
of, 1
March,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
darkness., 1
The, 1
obscurity, 1
augmented, 1
the, 1
acuteness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hearing;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
sound, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
convinced, 1
they, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
liberate, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
died, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
sank, 1
again, 1
into, 1
his, 1
seat., 1
At, 1
last,, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
o'clock,, 1
and, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
began, 1
to, 1
despair,, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
a, 1
key, 1
turned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
the, 1
bolts, 1
creaked,, 1
the, 1
massy, 1
oaken, 1
door, 1
flew, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
flood, 1
of, 1
light, 1
from, 1
two, 1
torches, 1
pervaded, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
By, 1
the, 1
torchlight, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
glittering, 1
sabres, 1
and, 1
carbines, 1
of, 1
four, 1
gendarmes., 1
He, 1
had, 1
advanced, 1
at, 1
first,, 1
but, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
this, 1
display, 1
of, 1
force., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
a, 1
gendarme., 1
"By, 1
the, 1
orders, 1
of, 1
the, 1
deputy, 1
procureur?", 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
so.", 1
The, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
they, 1
came, 1
from, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
relieved, 1
all, 1
Dantes', 1
apprehensions;, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
calmly,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
escort., 1
A, 1
carriage, 1
waited, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
police, 1
officer, 1
sat, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
carriage, 1
for, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
for, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
a, 1
gendarme., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
speak;, 1
but, 1
feeling, 1
himself, 1
urged, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
neither, 1
the, 1
power, 1
nor, 1
the, 1
intention, 1
to, 1
resist,, 1
he, 1
mounted, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
seated, 1
inside, 1
between, 1
two, 1
gendarmes;, 1
the, 1
two, 1
others, 1
took, 1
their, 1
places, 1
opposite,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
heavily, 1
over, 1
the, 1
stones., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
the, 1
windows--they, 1
were, 1
grated;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
his, 1
prison, 1
for, 1
another, 1
that, 1
was, 1
conveying, 1
him, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
whither., 1
Through, 1
the, 1
grating,, 1
however,, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
they, 1
were, 1
passing, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Caisserie,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Laurent, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Taramis,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
port., 1
Soon, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
lights, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Consigne., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped,, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
descended,, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
guardhouse,, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
soldiers, 1
came, 1
out, 1
and, 1
formed, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
order;, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
their, 1
muskets, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamps, 1
on, 1
the, 1
quay., 1
"Can, 1
all, 1
this, 1
force, 1
be, 1
summoned, 1
on, 1
my, 1
account?", 1
thought, 1
he., 1
The, 1
officer, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
locked,, 1
and,, 1
without, 1
speaking, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
answered, 1
Dantes', 1
question;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
between, 1
the, 1
ranks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
soldiers, 1
a, 1
passage, 1
formed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
the, 1
port., 1
The, 1
two, 1
gendarmes, 1
who, 1
were, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
him, 1
descended, 1
first,, 1
then, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
alight, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gendarmes, 1
on, 1
each, 1
side, 1
of, 1
him, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
example., 1
They, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
boat,, 1
which, 1
a, 1
custom-house, 1
officer, 1
held, 1
by, 1
a, 1
chain,, 1
near, 1
the, 1
quay., 1
The, 1
soldiers, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Dantes, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
stupid, 1
curiosity., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
he, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
stern-sheets, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
gendarmes,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
stationed, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bow;, 1
a, 1
shove, 1
sent, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
adrift,, 1
and, 1
four, 1
sturdy, 1
oarsmen, 1
impelled, 1
it, 1
rapidly, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Pilon., 1
At, 1
a, 1
shout, 1
from, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
the, 1
chain, 1
that, 1
closes, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
port, 1
was, 1
lowered, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
second, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
knew,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Frioul, 1
and, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
inner, 1
harbor., 1
The, 1
prisoner's, 1
first, 1
feeling, 1
was, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
again, 1
breathing, 1
the, 1
pure, 1
air--for, 1
air, 1
is, 1
freedom;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
sighed,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
before, 1
La, 1
Reserve,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
that, 1
morning, 1
been, 1
so, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
windows, 1
came, 1
the, 1
laughter, 1
and, 1
revelry, 1
of, 1
a, 1
ball., 1
Dantes, 1
folded, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
and, 1
prayed, 1
fervently., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
continued, 1
her, 1
voyage., 1
They, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
Tete, 1
de, 1
Morte,, 1
were, 1
now, 1
off, 1
the, 1
Anse, 1
du, 1
Pharo,, 1
and, 1
about, 1
to, 1
double, 1
the, 1
battery., 1
This, 1
manoeuvre, 1
was, 1
incomprehensible, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
"Whither, 1
are, 1
you, 1
taking, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
know.", 1
"But, 1
still"--, 1
"We, 1
are, 1
forbidden, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
any, 1
explanation.", 1
Dantes,, 1
trained, 1
in, 1
discipline,, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
would, 1
be, 1
more, 1
absurd, 1
than, 1
to, 1
question, 1
subordinates,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
forbidden, 1
to, 1
reply;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
silent., 1
The, 1
most, 1
vague, 1
and, 1
wild, 1
thoughts, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
they, 1
were, 1
in, 1
could, 1
not, 1
make, 1
a, 1
long, 1
voyage;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
vessel, 1
at, 1
anchor, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
harbor;, 1
he, 1
thought,, 1
perhaps,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
him, 1
on, 1
some, 1
distant, 1
point., 1
He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
bound,, 1
nor, 1
had, 1
they, 1
made, 1
any, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
handcuff, 1
him;, 1
this, 1
seemed, 1
a, 1
good, 1
augury., 1
Besides,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
deputy,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
told, 1
him, 1
that, 1
provided, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
pronounce, 1
the, 1
dreaded, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Noirtier,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
apprehend?, 1
Had, 1
not, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
destroyed, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
letter,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
proof, 1
against, 1
him?, 1
He, 1
waited, 1
silently,, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
pierce, 1
through, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
They, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
Ile, 1
Ratonneau,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
lighthouse, 1
stood,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
now, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
Point, 1
des, 1
Catalans., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
distinguish, 1
a, 1
feminine, 1
form, 1
on, 1
the, 1
beach,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
there, 1
Mercedes, 1
dwelt., 1
How, 1
was, 1
it, 1
that, 1
a, 1
presentiment, 1
did, 1
not, 1
warn, 1
Mercedes, 1
that, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
was, 1
within, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
yards, 1
of, 1
her?, 1
One, 1
light, 1
alone, 1
was, 1
visible;, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
it, 1
came, 1
from, 1
Mercedes', 1
chamber., 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
awake, 1
in, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
settlement., 1
A, 1
loud, 1
cry, 1
could, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
her., 1
But, 1
pride, 1
restrained, 1
him, 1
and, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
utter, 1
it., 1
What, 1
would, 1
his, 1
guards, 1
think, 1
if, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
shout, 1
like, 1
a, 1
madman?, 1
He, 1
remained, 1
silent,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
light;, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
went, 1
on,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
thought, 1
only, 1
of, 1
Mercedes., 1
An, 1
intervening, 1
elevation, 1
of, 1
land, 1
hid, 1
the, 1
light., 1
Dantes, 1
turned, 1
and, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
got, 1
out, 1
to, 1
sea., 1
While, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
thought,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
shipped, 1
their, 1
oars, 1
and, 1
hoisted, 1
sail;, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
now, 1
moving, 1
with, 1
the, 1
wind., 1
In, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
repugnance, 1
to, 1
address, 1
the, 1
guards,, 1
Dantes, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
nearest, 1
gendarme,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
his, 1
hand,--, 1
"Comrade,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
adjure, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Christian, 1
and, 1
a, 1
soldier,, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
where, 1
we, 1
are, 1
going., 1
I, 1
am, 1
Captain, 1
Dantes,, 1
a, 1
loyal, 1
Frenchman,, 1
thought, 1
accused, 1
of, 1
treason;, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
where, 1
you, 1
are, 1
conducting, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor, 1
I, 1
will, 1
submit, 1
to, 1
my, 1
fate.", 1
The, 1
gendarme, 1
looked, 1
irresolutely, 1
at, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
who, 1
returned, 1
for, 1
answer, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
no, 1
great, 1
harm, 1
in, 1
telling, 1
him, 1
now,", 1
and, 1
the, 1
gendarme, 1
replied,--, 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
native, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sailor,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
where, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going?", 1
"On, 1
my, 1
honor,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
idea.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
no, 1
idea, 1
whatever?", 1
"None, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
impossible.", 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true., 1
Tell, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
entreat.", 1
"But, 1
my, 1
orders.", 1
"Your, 1
orders, 1
do, 1
not, 1
forbid, 1
your, 1
telling, 1
me, 1
what, 1
I, 1
must, 1
know, 1
in, 1
ten, 1
minutes,, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
or, 1
an, 1
hour., 1
You, 1
see, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
escape,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
I, 1
intended.", 1
"Unless, 1
you, 1
are, 1
blind,, 1
or, 1
have, 1
never, 1
been, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
harbor,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
know.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not.", 1
"Look, 1
round, 1
you, 1
then.", 1
Dantes, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
forward,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
rise, 1
within, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
yards, 1
of, 1
him, 1
the, 1
black, 1
and, 1
frowning, 1
rock, 1
on, 1
which, 1
stands, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
This, 1
gloomy, 1
fortress,, 1
which, 1
has, 1
for, 1
more, 1
than, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
years, 1
furnished, 1
food, 1
for, 1
so, 1
many, 1
wild, 1
legends,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
Dantes, 1
like, 1
a, 1
scaffold, 1
to, 1
a, 1
malefactor., 1
"The, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If?", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
we, 1
going, 1
there, 1
for?", 1
The, 1
gendarme, 1
smiled., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
going, 1
there, 1
to, 1
be, 1
imprisoned,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
used, 1
for, 1
political, 1
prisoners., 1
I, 1
have, 1
committed, 1
no, 1
crime., 1
Are, 1
there, 1
any, 1
magistrates, 1
or, 1
judges, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If?", 1
"There, 1
are, 1
only,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
gendarme,, 1
"a, 1
governor,, 1
a, 1
garrison,, 1
turnkeys,, 1
and, 1
good, 1
thick, 1
walls., 1
Come,, 1
come,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
look, 1
so, 1
astonished,, 1
or, 1
you, 1
will, 1
make, 1
me, 1
think, 1
you, 1
are, 1
laughing, 1
at, 1
me, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
my, 1
good, 1
nature.", 1
Dantes, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
gendarme's, 1
hand, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
would, 1
crush, 1
it., 1
"You, 1
think,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
to, 1
be, 1
imprisoned, 1
there?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
probable;, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
squeeze, 1
so, 1
hard.", 1
"Without, 1
any, 1
inquiry,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
formality?", 1
"All, 1
the, 1
formalities, 1
have, 1
been, 1
gone, 1
through;, 1
the, 1
inquiry, 1
is, 1
already, 1
made.", 1
"And, 1
so,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
promises?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
what, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
promised, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
gendarme,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
know, 1
we, 1
are, 1
taking, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
But, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing?, 1
Help,, 1
comrades,, 1
help!", 1
By, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
movement,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
gendarme's, 1
practiced, 1
eye, 1
had, 1
perceived,, 1
Dantes, 1
sprang, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
precipitate, 1
himself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea;, 1
but, 1
four, 1
vigorous, 1
arms, 1
seized, 1
him, 1
as, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat., 1
He, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
cursing, 1
with, 1
rage., 1
"Good!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
gendarme,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
knee, 1
on, 1
his, 1
chest;, 1
"believe, 1
soft-spoken, 1
gentlemen, 1
again!, 1
Harkye,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
disobeyed, 1
my, 1
first, 1
order,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
disobey, 1
the, 1
second;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
move,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
blow, 1
your, 1
brains, 1
out.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
levelled, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
at, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
muzzle, 1
against, 1
his, 1
temple., 1
For, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
struggling, 1
crossed, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
so, 1
ending, 1
the, 1
unexpected, 1
evil, 1
that, 1
had, 1
overtaken, 1
him., 1
But, 1
he, 1
bethought, 1
him, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
promise;, 1
and,, 1
besides,, 1
death, 1
in, 1
a, 1
boat, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
seemed, 1
too, 1
terrible., 1
He, 1
remained, 1
motionless,, 1
but, 1
gnashing, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
and, 1
wringing, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
fury., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
came, 1
to, 1
a, 1
landing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
shock., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
leaped, 1
on, 1
shore,, 1
a, 1
cord, 1
creaked, 1
as, 1
it, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
a, 1
pulley,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
guessed, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
voyage,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
mooring, 1
the, 1
boat., 1
His, 1
guards,, 1
taking, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
coat-collar,, 1
forced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
rise,, 1
and, 1
dragged, 1
him, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
that, 1
lead, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fortress,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
police, 1
officer, 1
carrying, 1
a, 1
musket, 1
with, 1
fixed, 1
bayonet, 1
followed, 1
behind., 1
Dantes, 1
made, 1
no, 1
resistance;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream:, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
soldiers, 1
drawn, 1
up, 1
on, 1
the, 1
embankment;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
vaguely, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ascending, 1
a, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
steps;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
conscious, 1
that, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
a, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
door, 1
closed, 1
behind, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
all, 1
this, 1
indistinctly, 1
as, 1
through, 1
a, 1
mist., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
see, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
that, 1
terrible, 1
barrier, 1
against, 1
freedom,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
with, 1
utter, 1
despair., 1
They, 1
halted, 1
for, 1
a, 1
minute,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
he, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
his, 1
thoughts., 1
He, 1
looked, 1
around;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
court, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
high, 1
walls;, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
measured, 1
tread, 1
of, 1
sentinels,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
before, 1
the, 1
light, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
barrels, 1
of, 1
their, 1
muskets, 1
shine., 1
They, 1
waited, 1
upwards, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes., 1
Certain, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
escape,, 1
the, 1
gendarmes, 1
released, 1
him., 1
They, 1
seemed, 1
awaiting, 1
orders., 1
The, 1
orders, 1
came., 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
prisoner?", 1
said, 1
a, 1
voice., 1
"Here,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
gendarmes., 1
"Let, 1
him, 1
follow, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
him, 1
to, 1
his, 1
cell.", 1
"Go!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
gendarmes,, 1
thrusting, 1
Dantes, 1
forward., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
guide,, 1
who, 1
led, 1
him, 1
into, 1
a, 1
room, 1
almost, 1
under, 1
ground,, 1
whose, 1
bare, 1
and, 1
reeking, 1
walls, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
impregnated, 1
with, 1
tears;, 1
a, 1
lamp, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
stool, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
faintly,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
Dantes, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
his, 1
conductor,, 1
an, 1
under-jailer,, 1
ill-clothed,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
sullen, 1
appearance., 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
your, 1
chamber, 1
for, 1
to-night,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
late,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
is, 1
asleep., 1
To-morrow,, 1
perhaps,, 1
he, 1
may, 1
change, 1
you., 1
In, 1
the, 1
meantime, 1
there, 1
is, 1
bread,, 1
water,, 1
and, 1
fresh, 1
straw;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
a, 1
prisoner, 1
can, 1
wish, 1
for., 1
Goodnight.", 1
And, 1
before, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
open, 1
his, 1
mouth--before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
where, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
bread, 1
or, 1
the, 1
water--before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
glanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
where, 1
the, 1
straw, 1
was,, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
disappeared,, 1
taking, 1
with, 1
him, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
and, 1
closing, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
leaving, 1
stamped, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
prisoner's, 1
mind, 1
the, 1
dim, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dripping, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
darkness, 1
and, 1
in, 1
silence--cold, 1
as, 1
the, 1
shadows, 1
that, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
breathe, 1
on, 1
his, 1
burning, 1
forehead., 1
With, 1
the, 1
first, 1
dawn, 1
of, 1
day, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
returned,, 1
with, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
Dantes, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was., 1
He, 1
found, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
position,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
fixed, 1
there,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
swollen, 1
with, 1
weeping., 1
He, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night, 1
standing,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
sleep., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
advanced;, 1
Dantes, 1
appeared, 1
not, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
him., 1
He, 1
touched, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shoulder., 1
Edmond, 1
started., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
slept?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
jailer., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
stared., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
hungry?", 1
continued, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
anything?", 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
governor.", 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
chamber., 1
Dantes, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
stretched, 1
forth, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
open, 1
door;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
door, 1
closed., 1
All, 1
his, 1
emotion, 1
then, 1
burst, 1
forth;, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
weeping, 1
bitterly,, 1
and, 1
asking, 1
himself, 1
what, 1
crime, 1
he, 1
had, 1
committed, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
punished., 1
The, 1
day, 1
passed, 1
thus;, 1
he, 1
scarcely, 1
tasted, 1
food,, 1
but, 1
walked, 1
round, 1
and, 1
round, 1
the, 1
cell, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wild, 1
beast, 1
in, 1
its, 1
cage., 1
One, 1
thought, 1
in, 1
particular, 1
tormented, 1
him:, 1
namely,, 1
that, 1
during, 1
his, 1
journey, 1
hither, 1
he, 1
had, 1
sat, 1
so, 1
still,, 1
whereas, 1
he, 1
might,, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
times,, 1
have, 1
plunged, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
his, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
swimming,, 1
for, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
famous,, 1
have, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
concealed, 1
himself, 1
until, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Genoese, 1
or, 1
Spanish, 1
vessel,, 1
escaped, 1
to, 1
Spain, 1
or, 1
Italy,, 1
where, 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father, 1
could, 1
have, 1
joined, 1
him., 1
He, 1
had, 1
no, 1
fears, 1
as, 1
to, 1
how, 1
he, 1
should, 1
live--good, 1
seamen, 1
are, 1
welcome, 1
everywhere., 1
He, 1
spoke, 1
Italian, 1
like, 1
a, 1
Tuscan,, 1
and, 1
Spanish, 1
like, 1
a, 1
Castilian;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
free,, 1
and, 1
happy, 1
with, 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
whereas, 1
he, 1
was, 1
now, 1
confined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
that, 1
impregnable, 1
fortress,, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
future, 1
destiny, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father, 1
and, 1
Mercedes;, 1
and, 1
all, 1
this, 1
because, 1
he, 1
had, 1
trusted, 1
to, 1
Villefort's, 1
promise., 1
The, 1
thought, 1
was, 1
maddening,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
furiously, 1
down, 1
on, 1
his, 1
straw., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hour,, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
came, 1
again., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
more, 1
reasonable, 1
to-day?", 1
Dantes, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply., 1
"Come,, 1
cheer, 1
up;, 1
is, 1
there, 1
anything, 1
that, 1
I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
governor.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible.", 1
"Why, 1
so?", 1
"Because, 1
it, 1
is, 1
against, 1
prison, 1
rules,, 1
and, 1
prisoners, 1
must, 1
not, 1
even, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
it.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
allowed,, 1
then?", 1
"Better, 1
fare,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
books,, 1
and, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
about.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
want, 1
books,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
satisfied, 1
with, 1
my, 1
food,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
care, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
about;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
governor.", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
worry, 1
me, 1
by, 1
repeating, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
any, 1
more, 1
to, 1
eat.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Edmond,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
die, 1
of, 1
hunger--that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
saw, 1
by, 1
his, 1
tone, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
die;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
every, 1
prisoner, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
ten, 1
sous, 1
a, 1
day, 1
to, 1
his, 1
jailer,, 1
he, 1
replied, 1
in, 1
a, 1
more, 1
subdued, 1
tone., 1
"What, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
is, 1
impossible;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
very, 1
well, 1
behaved, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
about,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
day, 1
you, 1
will, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
chooses, 1
to, 1
reply,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
his, 1
affair.", 1
"But,", 1
asked, 1
Dantes,, 1
"how, 1
long, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
wait?", 1
"Ah,, 1
a, 1
month--six, 1
months--a, 1
year.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
too, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time., 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him, 1
at, 1
once.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
always, 1
brood, 1
over, 1
what, 1
is, 1
impossible,, 1
or, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
mad, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fortnight.", 1
"You, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
"Yes;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
an, 1
instance, 1
here;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
by, 1
always, 1
offering, 1
a, 1
million, 1
of, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
for, 1
his, 1
liberty, 1
that, 1
an, 1
abbe, 1
became, 1
mad,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
this, 1
chamber, 1
before, 1
you.", 1
"How, 1
long, 1
has, 1
he, 1
left, 1
it?", 1
"Two, 1
years.", 1
"Was, 1
he, 1
liberated,, 1
then?", 1
"No;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
put, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dungeon.", 1
"Listen!", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
an, 1
abbe,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mad;, 1
perhaps, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
present,, 1
unfortunately,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not., 1
I, 1
will, 1
make, 1
you, 1
another, 1
offer.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
a, 1
million,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
it, 1
not;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
crowns, 1
if,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
you, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Marseilles,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
seek, 1
out, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
named, 1
Mercedes,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
and, 1
give, 1
her, 1
two, 1
lines, 1
from, 1
me.", 1
"If, 1
I, 1
took, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
detected,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
lose, 1
my, 1
place,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
two, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
year;, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
a, 1
great, 1
fool, 1
to, 1
run, 1
such, 1
a, 1
risk, 1
for, 1
three, 1
hundred.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"mark, 1
this;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
at, 1
least, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
Mercedes, 1
I, 1
am, 1
here,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
some, 1
day, 1
hide, 1
myself, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
you, 1
enter, 1
I, 1
will, 1
dash, 1
out, 1
your, 1
brains, 1
with, 1
this, 1
stool.", 1
"Threats!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
retreating, 1
and, 1
putting, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
defensive;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
certainly, 1
going, 1
mad., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
began, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
three, 1
days, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
like, 1
him,, 1
mad, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
tie, 1
up;, 1
but,, 1
fortunately,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
dungeons, 1
here.", 1
Dantes, 1
whirled, 1
the, 1
stool, 1
round, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"All, 1
right,, 1
all, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
jailer;, 1
"all, 1
right,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
will, 1
have, 1
it, 1
so., 1
I, 1
will, 1
send, 1
word, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor.", 1
"Very, 1
well,", 1
returned, 1
Dantes,, 1
dropping, 1
the, 1
stool, 1
and, 1
sitting, 1
on, 1
it, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
mad., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
with, 1
a, 1
corporal, 1
and, 1
four, 1
soldiers., 1
"By, 1
the, 1
governor's, 1
orders,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"conduct, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
to, 1
the, 1
tier, 1
beneath.", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
dungeon,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
corporal., 1
"Yes;, 1
we, 1
must, 1
put, 1
the, 1
madman, 1
with, 1
the, 1
madmen.", 1
The, 1
soldiers, 1
seized, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
followed, 1
passively., 1
He, 1
descended, 1
fifteen, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dungeon, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thrust, 1
in., 1
The, 1
door, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
advanced, 1
with, 1
outstretched, 1
hands, 1
until, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
he, 1
then, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
until, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
became, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
was, 1
right;, 1
Dantes, 1
wanted, 1
but, 1
little, 1
of, 1
being, 1
utterly, 1
mad., 1
Chapter, 1
9., 1
The, 1
Evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Betrothal., 1
Villefort, 1
had,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
hastened, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Place, 1
du, 1
Grand, 1
Cours,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
house, 1
found, 1
that, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
at, 1
table, 1
were, 1
taking, 1
coffee, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
Renee, 1
was,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
company,, 1
anxiously, 1
awaiting, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
entrance, 1
was, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
general, 1
exclamation., 1
"Well,, 1
Decapitator,, 1
Guardian, 1
of, 1
the, 1
State,, 1
Royalist,, 1
Brutus,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
said, 1
one., 1
"Speak, 1
out.", 1
"Are, 1
we, 1
threatened, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
Reign, 1
of, 1
Terror?", 1
asked, 1
another., 1
"Has, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
ogre, 1
broken, 1
loose?", 1
cried, 1
a, 1
third., 1
"Marquise,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
approaching, 1
his, 1
future, 1
mother-in-law,, 1
"I, 1
request, 1
your, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
thus, 1
leaving, 1
you., 1
Will, 1
the, 1
marquis, 1
honor, 1
me, 1
by, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments', 1
private, 1
conversation?", 1
"Ah,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
really, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
matter,, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
remarking, 1
the, 1
cloud, 1
on, 1
Villefort's, 1
brow., 1
"So, 1
serious, 1
that, 1
I, 1
must, 1
take, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
you, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days;, 1
so,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Renee,, 1
"judge, 1
for, 1
yourself, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
not, 1
important.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
us?", 1
cried, 1
Renee,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
hide, 1
her, 1
emotion, 1
at, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
announcement., 1
"Alas,", 1
returned, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
must!", 1
"Where,, 1
then,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
marquise., 1
"That,, 1
madame,, 1
is, 1
an, 1
official, 1
secret;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
any, 1
commissions, 1
for, 1
Paris,, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine, 1
is, 1
going, 1
there, 1
to-night,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
with, 1
pleasure, 1
undertake, 1
them.", 1
The, 1
guests, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other., 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
alone?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
marquis., 1
"Yes,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
library,, 1
please.", 1
The, 1
marquis, 1
took, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
left, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
by, 1
themselves,, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is?", 1
"An, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
importance,, 1
that, 1
demands, 1
my, 1
immediate, 1
presence, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
Now,, 1
excuse, 1
the, 1
indiscretion,, 1
marquis,, 1
but, 1
have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
landed, 1
property?", 1
"All, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
funds;, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs.", 1
"Then, 1
sell, 1
out--sell, 1
out,, 1
marquis,, 1
or, 1
you, 1
will, 1
lose, 1
it, 1
all.", 1
"But, 1
how, 1
can, 1
I, 1
sell, 1
out, 1
here?", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
a, 1
broker,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
out, 1
without, 1
an, 1
instant's, 1
delay,, 1
perhaps, 1
even, 1
now, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
arrive, 1
too, 1
late.", 1
"The, 1
deuce, 1
you, 1
say!", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
lose, 1
no, 1
time,, 1
then!", 1
And,, 1
sitting, 1
down,, 1
he, 1
wrote, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
his, 1
broker,, 1
ordering, 1
him, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
out, 1
at, 1
the, 1
market, 1
price., 1
"Now,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
placing, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocketbook,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
have, 1
another!", 1
"To, 1
whom?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
king.", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
king?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
dare, 1
not, 1
write, 1
to, 1
his, 1
majesty.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
to, 1
write, 1
to, 1
his, 1
majesty,, 1
but, 1
ask, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Salvieux, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
I, 1
want, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
that, 1
will, 1
enable, 1
me, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
presence, 1
without, 1
all, 1
the, 1
formalities, 1
of, 1
demanding, 1
an, 1
audience;, 1
that, 1
would, 1
occasion, 1
a, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
precious, 1
time.", 1
"But, 1
address, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
keeper, 1
of, 1
the, 1
seals;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
the, 1
right, 1
of, 1
entry, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Tuileries,, 1
and, 1
can, 1
procure, 1
you, 1
audience, 1
at, 1
any, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
or, 1
night.", 1
"Doubtless;, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
divide, 1
the, 1
honors, 1
of, 1
my, 1
discovery, 1
with, 1
him., 1
The, 1
keeper, 1
would, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
background,, 1
and, 1
take, 1
all, 1
the, 1
glory, 1
to, 1
himself., 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
marquis,, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
made, 1
if, 1
I, 1
only, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
Tuileries, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
king, 1
will, 1
not, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
service, 1
I, 1
do, 1
him.", 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case, 1
go, 1
and, 1
get, 1
ready., 1
I, 1
will, 1
call, 1
Salvieux, 1
and, 1
make, 1
him, 1
write, 1
the, 1
letter.", 1
"Be, 1
as, 1
quick, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
in, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour.", 1
"Tell, 1
your, 1
coachman, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
present, 1
my, 1
excuses, 1
to, 1
the, 1
marquise, 1
and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Renee,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
on, 1
such, 1
a, 1
day, 1
with, 1
great, 1
regret.", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
find, 1
them, 1
both, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
can, 1
make, 1
your, 1
farewells, 1
in, 1
person.", 1
"A, 1
thousand, 1
thanks--and, 1
now, 1
for, 1
the, 1
letter.", 1
The, 1
marquis, 1
rang,, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
entered., 1
"Say, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
de, 1
Salvieux, 1
that, 1
I, 1
would, 1
like, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him.", 1
"Now,, 1
then,, 1
go,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
marquis., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
gone, 1
only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments.", 1
Villefort, 1
hastily, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
but, 1
reflecting, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
deputy, 1
procureur, 1
running, 1
through, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
would, 1
be, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
city, 1
into, 1
confusion,, 1
he, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
ordinary, 1
pace., 1
At, 1
his, 1
door, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
figure, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Mercedes,, 1
who,, 1
hearing, 1
no, 1
news, 1
of, 1
her, 1
lover,, 1
had, 1
come, 1
unobserved, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
after, 1
him., 1
As, 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
near,, 1
she, 1
advanced, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
instantly, 1
recognized, 1
her., 1
Her, 1
beauty, 1
and, 1
high, 1
bearing, 1
surprised, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
she, 1
inquired, 1
what, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
her, 1
lover,, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
the, 1
judge,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
the, 1
accused., 1
"The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
of,", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
abruptly,, 1
"is, 1
a, 1
great, 1
criminal,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
mademoiselle.", 1
Mercedes, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
tears,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
Villefort, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
her,, 1
again, 1
addressed, 1
him., 1
"But,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
is, 1
alive, 1
or, 1
dead,", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort., 1
And, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
putting, 1
an, 1
end, 1
to, 1
the, 1
interview,, 1
he, 1
pushed, 1
by, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
exclude, 1
the, 1
pain, 1
he, 1
felt., 1
But, 1
remorse, 1
is, 1
not, 1
thus, 1
banished;, 1
like, 1
Virgil's, 1
wounded, 1
hero,, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
arrow, 1
in, 1
his, 1
wound,, 1
and,, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
Villefort, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
sigh, 1
that, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
sob,, 1
and, 1
sank, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
first, 1
pangs, 1
of, 1
an, 1
unending, 1
torture, 1
seized, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
The, 1
man, 1
he, 1
sacrificed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ambition,, 1
that, 1
innocent, 1
victim, 1
immolated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
altar, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
faults,, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
him, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
threatening,, 1
leading, 1
his, 1
affianced, 1
bride, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
bringing, 1
with, 1
him, 1
remorse,, 1
not, 1
such, 1
as, 1
the, 1
ancients, 1
figured,, 1
furious, 1
and, 1
terrible,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
slow, 1
and, 1
consuming, 1
agony, 1
whose, 1
pangs, 1
are, 1
intensified, 1
from, 1
hour, 1
to, 1
hour, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
death., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
hesitation., 1
He, 1
had, 1
frequently, 1
called, 1
for, 1
capital, 1
punishment, 1
on, 1
criminals,, 1
and, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
his, 1
irresistible, 1
eloquence, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
condemned,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
remorse, 1
had, 1
never, 1
clouded, 1
Villefort's, 1
brow,, 1
because, 1
they, 1
were, 1
guilty;, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
so;, 1
but, 1
here, 1
was, 1
an, 1
innocent, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
happiness, 1
he, 1
had, 1
destroyed:, 1
in, 1
this, 1
case, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
judge,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
executioner., 1
As, 1
he, 1
thus, 1
reflected,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
we, 1
have, 1
described,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
been, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
arise, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bosom,, 1
and, 1
fill, 1
him, 1
with, 1
vague, 1
apprehensions., 1
It, 1
is, 1
thus, 1
that, 1
a, 1
wounded, 1
man, 1
trembles, 1
instinctively, 1
at, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
the, 1
finger, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wound, 1
until, 1
it, 1
be, 1
healed,, 1
but, 1
Villefort's, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
that, 1
never, 1
close,, 1
or, 1
if, 1
they, 1
do,, 1
only, 1
close, 1
to, 1
reopen, 1
more, 1
agonizing, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
If, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
sweet, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
Renee, 1
had, 1
sounded, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears, 1
pleading, 1
for, 1
mercy,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"In, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
God,, 1
I, 1
conjure, 1
you, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
me, 1
my, 1
affianced, 1
husband,", 1
his, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
trembling, 1
hands, 1
would, 1
have, 1
signed, 1
his, 1
release;, 1
but, 1
no, 1
voice, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
stillness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chamber,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened, 1
only, 1
by, 1
Villefort's, 1
valet,, 1
who, 1
came, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
travelling, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
in, 1
readiness., 1
Villefort, 1
rose,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
sprang,, 1
from, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
hastily, 1
opened, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drawers, 1
of, 1
his, 1
desk,, 1
emptied, 1
all, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
it, 1
contained, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
stood, 1
motionless, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
pressed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
muttered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
inarticulate, 1
sounds,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
perceiving, 1
that, 1
his, 1
servant, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
cloak, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulders,, 1
he, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
ordering, 1
the, 1
postilions, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's., 1
The, 1
hapless, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
doomed., 1
As, 1
the, 1
marquis, 1
had, 1
promised,, 1
Villefort, 1
found, 1
the, 1
marquise, 1
and, 1
Renee, 1
in, 1
waiting., 1
He, 1
started, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Renee,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
fancied, 1
she, 1
was, 1
again, 1
about, 1
to, 1
plead, 1
for, 1
Dantes., 1
Alas,, 1
her, 1
emotions, 1
were, 1
wholly, 1
personal:, 1
she, 1
was, 1
thinking, 1
only, 1
of, 1
Villefort's, 1
departure., 1
She, 1
loved, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
left, 1
her, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
become, 1
her, 1
husband., 1
Villefort, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
when, 1
he, 1
should, 1
return,, 1
and, 1
Renee,, 1
far, 1
from, 1
pleading, 1
for, 1
Dantes,, 1
hated, 1
the, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
crime, 1
separated, 1
her, 1
from, 1
her, 1
lover., 1
Meanwhile, 1
what, 1
of, 1
Mercedes?, 1
She, 1
had, 1
met, 1
Fernand, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Loge;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
despairingly, 1
cast, 1
herself, 1
on, 1
her, 1
couch., 1
Fernand,, 1
kneeling, 1
by, 1
her, 1
side,, 1
took, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
kisses, 1
that, 1
Mercedes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
feel., 1
She, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night, 1
thus., 1
The, 1
lamp, 1
went, 1
out, 1
for, 1
want, 1
of, 1
oil,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
heed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
and, 1
dawn, 1
came,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
day., 1
Grief, 1
had, 1
made, 1
her, 1
blind, 1
to, 1
all, 1
but, 1
one, 1
object--that, 1
was, 1
Edmond., 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
there,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Fernand., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
quitted, 1
you, 1
since, 1
yesterday,", 1
returned, 1
Fernand, 1
sorrowfully., 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
not, 1
readily, 1
given, 1
up, 1
the, 1
fight., 1
He, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
prison,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
all, 1
his, 1
friends,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
influential, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
the, 1
city;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
report, 1
was, 1
already, 1
in, 1
circulation, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
arrested, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist, 1
agent;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
most, 1
sanguine, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
any, 1
attempt, 1
of, 1
Napoleon, 1
to, 1
remount, 1
the, 1
throne, 1
as, 1
impossible,, 1
he, 1
met, 1
with, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
refusal,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
home, 1
in, 1
despair,, 1
declaring, 1
that, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
was, 1
serious, 1
and, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
could, 1
be, 1
done., 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
equally, 1
restless, 1
and, 1
uneasy,, 1
but, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
seeking,, 1
like, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
Dantes,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
shut, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
with, 1
two, 1
bottles, 1
of, 1
black, 1
currant, 1
brandy,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
drowning, 1
reflection., 1
But, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
succeed,, 1
and, 1
became, 1
too, 1
intoxicated, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
any, 1
more, 1
drink,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
not, 1
so, 1
intoxicated, 1
as, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
With, 1
his, 1
elbows, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
he, 1
sat, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
empty, 1
bottles,, 1
while, 1
spectres, 1
danced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
unsnuffed, 1
candle--spectres, 1
such, 1
as, 1
Hoffmann, 1
strews, 1
over, 1
his, 1
punch-drenched, 1
pages,, 1
like, 1
black,, 1
fantastic, 1
dust., 1
Danglars, 1
alone, 1
was, 1
content, 1
and, 1
joyous--he, 1
had, 1
got, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
an, 1
enemy, 1
and, 1
made, 1
his, 1
own, 1
situation, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
secure., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
men, 1
born, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pen, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
ear,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
inkstand, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
a, 1
heart., 1
Everything, 1
with, 1
him, 1
was, 1
multiplication, 1
or, 1
subtraction., 1
The, 1
life, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
was, 1
to, 1
him, 1
of, 1
far, 1
less, 1
value, 1
than, 1
a, 1
numeral,, 1
especially, 1
when,, 1
by, 1
taking, 1
it, 1
away,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
increase, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
total, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
desires., 1
He, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
at, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
slept, 1
in, 1
peace., 1
Villefort,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
received, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Salvieux', 1
letter,, 1
embraced, 1
Renee,, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
marquise's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
shaken, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
started, 1
for, 1
Paris, 1
along, 1
the, 1
Aix, 1
road., 1
Old, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
dying, 1
with, 1
anxiety, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
Edmond., 1
But, 1
we, 1
know, 1
very, 1
well, 1
what, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
Edmond., 1
Chapter, 1
10., 1
The, 1
King's, 1
Closet, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Tuileries., 1
We, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
Villefort, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
travelling--thanks, 1
to, 1
trebled, 1
fees--with, 1
all, 1
speed,, 1
and, 1
passing, 1
through, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
apartments,, 1
enter, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Tuileries, 1
the, 1
little, 1
room, 1
with, 1
the, 1
arched, 1
window,, 1
so, 1
well, 1
known, 1
as, 1
having, 1
been, 1
the, 1
favorite, 1
closet, 1
of, 1
Napoleon, 1
and, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1
Philippe., 1
There,, 1
seated, 1
before, 1
a, 1
walnut, 1
table, 1
he, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
with, 1
him, 1
from, 1
Hartwell,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
which,, 1
from, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
fancies, 1
not, 1
uncommon, 1
to, 1
great, 1
people,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
particularly, 1
attached,, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
was, 1
carelessly, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
fifty, 1
or, 1
fifty-two, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
with, 1
gray, 1
hair,, 1
aristocratic, 1
bearing,, 1
and, 1
exceedingly, 1
gentlemanly, 1
attire,, 1
and, 1
meanwhile, 1
making, 1
a, 1
marginal, 1
note, 1
in, 1
a, 1
volume, 1
of, 1
Gryphius's, 1
rather, 1
inaccurate,, 1
but, 1
much, 1
sought-after,, 1
edition, 1
of, 1
Horace--a, 1
work, 1
which, 1
was, 1
much, 1
indebted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sagacious, 1
observations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
philosophical, 1
monarch., 1
"You, 1
say,, 1
sir"--said, 1
the, 1
king., 1
"That, 1
I, 1
am, 1
exceedingly, 1
disquieted,, 1
sire.", 1
"Really,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
had, 1
a, 1
vision, 1
of, 1
the, 1
seven, 1
fat, 1
kine, 1
and, 1
the, 1
seven, 1
lean, 1
kine?", 1
"No,, 1
sire,, 1
for, 1
that, 1
would, 1
only, 1
betoken, 1
for, 1
us, 1
seven, 1
years, 1
of, 1
plenty, 1
and, 1
seven, 1
years, 1
of, 1
scarcity;, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
king, 1
as, 1
full, 1
of, 1
foresight, 1
as, 1
your, 1
majesty,, 1
scarcity, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
feared.", 1
"Then, 1
of, 1
what, 1
other, 1
scourge, 1
are, 1
you, 1
afraid,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Blacas?", 1
"Sire,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
every, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
a, 1
storm, 1
is, 1
brewing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
south.", 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
duke,", 1
replied, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
are, 1
wrongly, 1
informed,, 1
and, 1
know, 1
positively, 1
that,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
fine, 1
weather, 1
in, 1
that, 1
direction.", 1
Man, 1
of, 1
ability, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
liked, 1
a, 1
pleasant, 1
jest., 1
"Sire,", 1
continued, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Blacas,, 1
"if, 1
it, 1
only, 1
be, 1
to, 1
reassure, 1
a, 1
faithful, 1
servant,, 1
will, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1
send, 1
into, 1
Languedoc,, 1
Provence,, 1
and, 1
Dauphine,, 1
trusty, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
back, 1
a, 1
faithful, 1
report, 1

to, 1
the, 1
feeling, 1
in, 1
these, 1
three, 1
provinces?", 1
"Caninus, 1
surdis,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
continuing, 1
the, 1
annotations, 1
in, 1
his, 1
Horace., 1
"Sire,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
courtier,, 1
laughing,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
the, 1
quotation,, 1
"your, 1
majesty, 1
may, 1
be, 1
perfectly, 1
right, 1
in, 1
relying, 1
on, 1
the, 1
good, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
fear, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
altogether, 1
wrong, 1
in, 1
dreading, 1
some, 1
desperate, 1
attempt.", 1
"By, 1
whom?", 1
"By, 1
Bonaparte,, 1
or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
by, 1
his, 1
adherents.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Blacas,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
"you, 1
with, 1
your, 1
alarms, 1
prevent, 1
me, 1
from, 1
working.", 1
"And, 1
you,, 1
sire,, 1
prevent, 1
me, 1
from, 1
sleeping, 1
with, 1
your, 1
security.", 1
"Wait,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
such, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
note, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Pastor, 1
quum, 1
traheret--wait,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
you, 1
afterwards.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
pause,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
wrote,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
as, 1
small, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
another, 1
note, 1
on, 1
the, 1
margin, 1
of, 1
his, 1
Horace,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
duke, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
thinks, 1
he, 1
has, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
is, 1
only, 1
commenting, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
another,, 1
said,--, 1
"Go, 1
on,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
duke,, 1
go, 1
on--I, 1
listen.", 1
"Sire,", 1
said, 1
Blacas,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
sacrificing, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
profit,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1

you, 1
that, 1

not, 1
mere, 1
rumors, 1
destitute, 1
of, 1

thus, 1
disquiet, 1
me;, 1

a, 1
serious-minded, 1
man,, 1
deserving, 1

(the, 1

he, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
words),, 1

"Mala, 1

Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
still, 1
annotating., 1
"Does, 1
your, 1

me, 1
to, 1

"By, 1
no, 1

and, 1
M., 1
Dandre,, 1
announced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
chamberlain-in-waiting,, 1
entered., 1
"Come, 1

Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
with, 1
repressed, 1

of, 1
a, 1

with, 1
his, 1

"Speak, 1
as, 1
fully, 1
as, 1
you, 1

sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
who, 1
began, 1
to, 1
give, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
emotion, 1
which, 1
had, 1
showed, 1
itself, 1
in, 1
Blacas's, 1
face, 1
and, 1
affected, 1
Villefort's, 1
voice., 1
"Speak,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
pray, 1
begin, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning;, 1

like, 1

Villefort,, 1

must, 1
entreat, 1
your, 1
forgiveness, 1

my, 1
anxiety, 1
leads, 1
to, 1

obscurity, 1

A, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
king, 1
after, 1
this, 1
discreet, 1
and, 1
subtle, 1
exordium,, 1
assured, 1
Villefort, 1
of, 1
the, 1
benignity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
august, 1
auditor,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on:--, 1

exercise, 1
of, 1

meditates, 1

project,, 1

however, 1
mad,, 1
is, 1

terrible., 1

moment, 1

left, 1

go, 1

king,, 1

agitated;, 1

the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1

Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
pushed, 1
from, 1
him, 1
violently, 1
the, 1
table, 1
at, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
sitting., 1

you,, 1

M., 1
de, 1

moved, 1
suddenly, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
baron,, 1

the, 1
fright, 1
of, 1

was, 1

more, 1
to, 1

advantage, 1

"Sire"--stammered, 1
the, 1
baron., 1

it?", 1
asked, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1

minister, 1
of, 1
police,, 1

way, 1
to, 1
an, 1
impulse, 1
of, 1

at, 1

feet, 1
of, 1

retreated, 1
a, 1
step, 1

made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
indescribable, 1
anger, 1

alarm,, 1

then, 1
drew, 1
himself, 1
up, 1

blow, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
him, 1

"But"--said, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
suddenly, 1
checking, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
silent;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
"Your, 1
pardon,, 1

said,, 1
bowing,, 1

Villefort,, 1

detested, 1

advancing!", 1

Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
then, 1
advancing, 1
on, 1
Paris?", 1
The, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police, 1
maintained, 1
a, 1
silence, 1
which, 1
was, 1
equivalent, 1
to, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
avowal., 1

inquired, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
of, 1

cruel, 1
fact;, 1

the, 1
feeling, 1
in, 1

the, 1
reverse, 1

Louis,, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
well, 1
informed., 1
And, 1
how, 1
many, 1
men, 1
had, 1
he, 1
with, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1

with, 1
a, 1
withering, 1
smile., 1
"Sire,, 1

was, 1
impossible, 1

bowed, 1
his, 1
head,, 1

while, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
color, 1
overspread, 1

he, 1
stammered, 1
out,--, 1

have, 1
done., 1
"So, 1
then,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
turning, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
anger,, 1
"seven, 1
conjoined, 1
and, 1
allied, 1
armies, 1
overthrew, 1
that, 1
man., 1
A, 1
miracle, 1
of, 1
heaven, 1
replaced, 1
me, 1
on, 1
the, 1
throne, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fathers, 1
after, 1
five-and-twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
exile., 1
I, 1
have,, 1
during, 1
those, 1
five-and-twenty, 1
years,, 1
spared, 1
no, 1
pains, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
people, 1
of, 1
France, 1
and, 1
the, 1
interests, 1
which, 1
were, 1
confided, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
and, 1
now,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
see, 1
the, 1
fruition, 1
of, 1
my, 1
wishes, 1
almost, 1
within, 1
reach,, 1
the, 1
power, 1
I, 1
hold, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands, 1
bursts,, 1
and, 1
shatters, 1
me, 1
to, 1
atoms!", 1
"Sire,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
fatality!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
minister,, 1
feeling, 1
that, 1
the, 1
pressure, 1
of, 1
circumstances,, 1
however, 1
light, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
destiny,, 1
was, 1
too, 1
much, 1
for, 1
any, 1
human, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
endure., 1
"What, 1
our, 1
enemies, 1
say, 1
of, 1
us, 1
is, 1
then, 1
true., 1
We, 1
have, 1
learnt, 1
nothing,, 1
forgotten, 1
nothing!, 1
If, 1
I, 1
were, 1
betrayed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
console, 1
myself;, 1
but, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
persons, 1
elevated, 1
by, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
places, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
who, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
me, 1
more, 1
carefully, 1
than, 1
over, 1
themselves,--for, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
theirs--before, 1
me, 1
they, 1
were, 1
nothing--after, 1
me, 1
they, 1
will, 1
be, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
perish, 1
miserably, 1
from, 1
incapacity--ineptitude!, 1
Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right--it, 1
is, 1
fatality!", 1
The, 1
minister, 1
quailed, 1
before, 1
this, 1
outburst, 1
of, 1
sarcasm., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Blacas, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
moisture, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
Villefort, 1
smiled, 1
within, 1
himself,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
increased, 1
importance., 1
"To, 1
fall,", 1
continued, 1
King, 1
Louis,, 1
who, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
glance, 1
had, 1
sounded, 1
the, 1
abyss, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
monarchy, 1
hung, 1
suspended,--"to, 1
fall,, 1
and, 1
learn, 1
of, 1
that, 1
fall, 1
by, 1
telegraph!, 1
Oh,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
mount, 1
the, 1
scaffold, 1
of, 1
my, 1
brother,, 1
Louis, 1
XVI.,, 1
than, 1
thus, 1
descend, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Tuileries, 1
driven, 1
away, 1
by, 1
ridicule., 1
Ridicule,, 1
sir--why,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
not, 1
its, 1
power, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
know, 1
it!", 1
"Sire,, 1
sire,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
minister,, 1
"for, 1
pity's"--, 1
"Approach,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who,, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
breathless,, 1
was, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
a, 1
conversation, 1
on, 1
which, 1
depended, 1
the, 1
destiny, 1
of, 1
a, 1
kingdom., 1
"Approach,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
monsieur, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
know, 1
beforehand, 1
all, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
known.", 1
"Sire,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
really, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
secrets, 1
which, 1
that, 1
man, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Really, 1
impossible!, 1
Yes--that, 1
is, 1
a, 1
great, 1
word,, 1
sir., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
great, 1
words,, 1
as, 1
there, 1
are, 1
great, 1
men;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
measured, 1
them., 1
Really, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
a, 1
minister, 1
who, 1
has, 1
an, 1
office,, 1
agents,, 1
spies,, 1
and, 1
fifteen, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
secret, 1
service, 1
money,, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
is, 1
going, 1
on, 1
at, 1
sixty, 1
leagues, 1
from, 1
the, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
France!, 1
Well,, 1
then,, 1
see,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
who, 1
had, 1
none, 1
of, 1
these, 1
resources, 1
at, 1
his, 1
disposal--a, 1
gentleman,, 1
only, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
magistrate,, 1
who, 1
learned, 1
more, 1
than, 1
you, 1
with, 1
all, 1
your, 1
police,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
would, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
my, 1
crown,, 1
if,, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
directing, 1
a, 1
telegraph.", 1
The, 1
look, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police, 1
was, 1
turned, 1
with, 1
concentrated, 1
spite, 1
on, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
modest, 1
triumph., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
Blacas,", 1
continued, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.;, 1
"for, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
nothing,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
you, 1
have, 1
had, 1
the, 1
good, 1
sense, 1
to, 1
persevere, 1
in, 1
your, 1
suspicions., 1
Any, 1
other, 1
than, 1
yourself, 1
would, 1
have, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
disclosure, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
insignificant,, 1
or, 1
else, 1
dictated, 1
by, 1
venal, 1
ambition,", 1
These, 1
words, 1
were, 1
an, 1
allusion, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sentiments, 1
which, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police, 1
had, 1
uttered, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
confidence, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
before., 1
Villefort, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
intent., 1
Any, 1
other, 1
person, 1
would,, 1
perhaps,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
such, 1
an, 1
intoxicating, 1
draught, 1
of, 1
praise;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
make, 1
for, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
mortal, 1
enemy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
police, 1
minister,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
Dandre, 1
was, 1
irrevocably, 1
lost., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
minister,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
plenitude, 1
of, 1
his, 1
power,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
unearth, 1
Napoleon's, 1
secret,, 1
might, 1
in, 1
despair, 1
at, 1
his, 1
own, 1
downfall, 1
interrogate, 1
Dantes, 1
and, 1
so, 1
lay, 1
bare, 1
the, 1
motives, 1
of, 1
Villefort's, 1
plot., 1
Realizing, 1
this,, 1
Villefort, 1
came, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rescue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crest-fallen, 1
minister,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
aiding, 1
to, 1
crush, 1
him., 1
"Sire,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"the, 1
suddenness, 1
of, 1
this, 1
event, 1
must, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1
that, 1
the, 1
issue, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Providence;, 1
what, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1
is, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
attribute, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
profound, 1
perspicacity, 1
is, 1
simply, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
chance,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
profited, 1
by, 1
that, 1
chance,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
good, 1
and, 1
devoted, 1
servant--that's, 1
all., 1
Do, 1
not, 1
attribute, 1
to, 1
me, 1
more, 1
than, 1
I, 1
deserve,, 1
sire,, 1
that, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1
may, 1
never, 1
have, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
the, 1
first, 1
opinion, 1

have, 1
been, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
form, 1
of, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
by, 1
an, 1
eloquent, 1
look,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
his, 1
design;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
that, 1
without, 1
forfeiting, 1
the, 1
gratitude, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
one, 1
on, 1
whom,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
necessity,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
rely., 1
"'Tis, 1
well,", 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
king., 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Blacas, 1
and, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
further, 1
occasion, 1
for, 1
you,, 1

you, 1
may, 1
retire;, 1
what, 1
now, 1
remains, 1
to, 1
do, 1

in, 1
the, 1
department, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
war.", 1
"Fortunately,, 1
sire,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Blacas,, 1
"we, 1
can, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
the, 1
army;, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1
knows, 1
how, 1

report, 1
confirms, 1
their, 1

"Do, 1
not, 1

you, 1
learned, 1
with, 1
regard, 1
to, 1

"The, 1
affair, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Jacques!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Villefort,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
repress, 1
an, 1
exclamation., 1
Then,, 1
suddenly, 1
pausing,, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"Your, 1
pardon,, 1
sire,, 1

my, 1
devotion, 1
to, 1

deeply, 1
engraved, 1

"Go, 1
on,, 1
go, 1
on,, 1

replied, 1
the, 1
king;, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
to-day, 1
earned, 1
the, 1
right, 1
to, 1
make, 1
inquiries, 1

"Sire,", 1
interposed, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1

"I, 1
came, 1

the, 1
contrary,", 1

At, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
General, 1
Quesnel,, 1
Villefort, 1
trembled., 1
"Everything, 1
points, 1
to, 1
the, 1
conclusion,, 1

the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1

hung, 1
on, 1

speaker's, 1
lips,, 1
turned, 1
alternately, 1
red, 1

pale., 1

looked, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
"Do, 1

went, 1
on, 1
speaking, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
bend, 1
under, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
he, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
had, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
vigilance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agent, 1
who, 1
followed, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
breathed, 1
again., 1
"Continue, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
for, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
king, 1
to, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
of, 1
police;, 1
"for, 1
if,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1

convinced,, 1

his, 1
assassins,, 1
Bonapartists, 1

not,, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
cruelly, 1
punished.", 1
It, 1
required, 1
all, 1
Villefort's, 1
coolness, 1
not, 1
to, 1
betray, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
with, 1
which, 1
this, 1
declaration, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king, 1
inspired, 1
him., 1
"How, 1
strange,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
with, 1
some, 1
asperity;, 1
"the, 1
police, 1
think, 1
that, 1
they, 1
have, 1
disposed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
matter, 1
when, 1
they, 1
say,, 1
'A, 1
murder, 1
has, 1
been, 1
committed,', 1
and, 1
especially, 1
so, 1
when, 1
they, 1
can, 1
add,, 1
'And, 1
we, 1
are, 1
on, 1
the, 1
track, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guilty, 1
persons.'", 1
"Sire,, 1
your, 1
majesty, 1

course, 1

stopped, 1
at, 1
your, 1
father's?", 1
A, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
faintness, 1
came, 1
over, 1
Villefort., 1
"No,, 1
sire,", 1
he, 1
replied,, 1
"I, 1
alighted, 1
at, 1
the, 1

him,, 1
then?", 1

not,, 1

"Ah,, 1
I, 1
forgot,", 1
said, 1
Louis,, 1
smiling, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
all, 1
these, 1
questions, 1
were, 1
not, 1
made, 1
without, 1
a, 1
motive;, 1

the, 1

Villefort's, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
tears, 1
of, 1
joy, 1

the, 1
minister, 1

it, 1
be, 1
long, 1
first?", 1

Villefort,, 1
saluting, 1
the, 1
minister,, 1
whose, 1
career, 1
was, 1
ended,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
about, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
hackney-coach., 1

passed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
hailed;, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
address, 1
to, 1
the, 1
driver,, 1

springing, 1
in,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
loose, 1
to, 1
dreams, 1
of, 1
ambition., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
Villefort, 1
reached, 1
his, 1
hotel,, 1
ordered, 1
horses, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
in, 1
two, 1
hours,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
to, 1
have, 1
his, 1
breakfast, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
his, 1
repast, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
rang, 1
sharp, 1
and, 1
loud., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
heard, 1
some, 1
one, 1
speak, 1
his, 1
name., 1
"Who, 1
could, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
here, 1
already?", 1

the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
entered., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
it?--Who, 1
rang?--Who, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
me?", 1

stranger, 1

to, 1

"To, 1
me?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Did, 1
he, 1
mention, 1
my, 1

"Yes.", 1
"What, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
person, 1
is, 1
he?", 1

a, 1
man, 1
of, 1

dark;, 1
with, 1
black, 1
eyes,, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
black, 1
eyebrows.", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
dressed?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort, 1
quickly., 1
"In, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
frock-coat,, 1
buttoned, 1
up, 1
close,, 1
decorated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
he!", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
turning, 1
pale., 1
"Eh,, 1
pardieu,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
individual, 1
whose, 1
description, 1
we, 1
have, 1
twice, 1
given,, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
"what, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
ceremony!, 1

their, 1
fathers, 1
waiting, 1
in, 1
their, 1
anterooms?", 1
"Father!", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
"then, 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
deceived;, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
sure, 1

must, 1
be, 1
you.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
felt, 1
so, 1
sure,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
new-comer,, 1
putting, 1
his, 1
cane, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
my, 1

Gerard,, 1

waiting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
"Leave, 1
us,, 1
Germain,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
with, 1
evident, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
astonishment., 1
Chapter, 1
12., 1
Father, 1
and, 1
Son., 1
M., 1
Noirtier--for, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
he, 1
who, 1
entered--looked, 1
after, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
until, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
fearing,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
overheard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
again,, 1
nor, 1
was, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
useless,, 1
as, 1
appeared, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
retreat, 1
of, 1
Germain,, 1
who, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
exempt, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sin, 1
which, 1
ruined, 1
our, 1
first, 1
parents., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
then, 1
took, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
close, 1
and, 1
bolt, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber, 1
door,, 1
then, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed-chamber,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
all, 1
his, 1
motions, 1
with, 1
surprise, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
conceal., 1
"Well,, 1
now,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Gerard,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
very, 1
significant, 1
look,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
you, 1
seem, 1
as, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
not, 1
very, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me?", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
am,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
delighted;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
so, 1
little, 1
expected, 1
your, 1
visit,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
has, 1
somewhat, 1
overcome, 1
me.", 1
"But,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
seating, 1
himself,, 1
"I, 1
might, 1
say, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
announce, 1
to, 1
me, 1

"And, 1
if, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
Gerard,, 1
drawing, 1
closer, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
complain,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
you, 1
that, 1

came,, 1

my, 1
journey, 1

"Ah,, 1
indeed!", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
stretching, 1
himself, 1
out, 1
at, 1
his, 1
ease, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chair., 1
"Really,, 1
pray, 1

me, 1

it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
interesting.", 1
"Father,, 1

have, 1
heard, 1

of, 1
a, 1
certain, 1

the, 1
Rue, 1

"No., 1

"Father,, 1
your, 1
coolness, 1
makes, 1
me, 1

"Why,, 1
my, 1

boy,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
man, 1
has, 1
been, 1
proscribed, 1

the, 1
mountaineers,, 1
has, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1

go, 1
on,, 1
what, 1
about, 1

the, 1

they, 1
induced, 1

to, 1
go, 1
there,, 1

placed, 1
in, 1

of, 1
Villefort's, 1
of, 1
dark, 1
brown,, 1

cut, 1
away, 1
in, 1

tried, 1
on, 1
before, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
a, 1
narrow-brimmed, 1
hat, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son's,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
fit, 1
him, 1
perfectly,, 1

his, 1
cane, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
deposited, 1
it,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
up, 1
a, 1
small, 1
bamboo, 1
switch,, 1
cut, 1
the, 1
air, 1
with, 1
it, 1
once, 1
or, 1
twice,, 1
and, 1
walked, 1
about, 1
with, 1
that, 1
easy, 1
swagger, 1
which, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
principal, 1
characteristics., 1
"Well,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
wondering, 1
son,, 1
when, 1
this, 1
disguise, 1
was, 1
completed,, 1
"well,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
your, 1
police, 1
will, 1
recognize, 1
me, 1
now.", 1
"No,, 1
father,", 1
stammered, 1
Villefort;, 1
"at, 1
least,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
not.", 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
boy,", 1
continued, 1
Noirtier,, 1
"I, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
your, 1
prudence, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
all, 1
the, 1
things, 1

I, 1
leave, 1
in, 1
your, 1
care.", 1
"Oh,, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes;, 1
and, 1
now, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
really, 1
saved, 1
my, 1
life;, 1
be, 1
assured, 1
I, 1
will, 1
return, 1

favor, 1
hereafter.", 1
Villefort, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
not, 1
convinced, 1
yet?", 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be, 1
mistaken.", 1
"Shall, 1
you, 1
see, 1
the, 1
king, 1
again?", 1
"Perhaps.", 1
"Would, 1
you, 1
pass, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
for, 1
a, 1
prophet?", 1
"Prophets, 1
of, 1
evil, 1
are, 1
not, 1
in, 1
favor, 1
at, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
father.", 1
"True,, 1
but, 1
some, 1
day, 1
they, 1
do, 1
them, 1
justice;, 1
and, 1
supposing, 1
a, 1
second, 1
restoration,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
then, 1
pass, 1
for, 1
a, 1
great, 1

"Well,, 1
what, 1
should, 1
I, 1
say, 1
to, 1
the, 1
king?", 1
"Say, 1

had, 1
finished,, 1
with, 1
the, 1

calmness, 1
that, 1
had, 1
characterized, 1
him, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
this, 1
remarkable, 1
and, 1
trying, 1
conversation., 1
Villefort,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
agitated,, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
put, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
curtain,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
pass,, 1
cool, 1
and, 1
collected,, 1
by, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
ill-looking, 1
men, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1

street,, 1

were, 1
there,, 1
perhaps,, 1
to, 1
arrest, 1
a, 1
man, 1
with, 1
black, 1
whiskers,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
frock-coat,, 1
and, 1
hat, 1
with, 1
broad, 1
brim., 1
Villefort, 1
stood, 1
watching,, 1
breathless,, 1
until, 1
his, 1
father, 1
had, 1
disappeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Bussy., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
various, 1
articles, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
put, 1

black, 1
cravat, 1
and, 1
blue, 1
frock-coat, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
portmanteau,, 1
threw, 1
the, 1
hat, 1
into, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
closet,, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
cane, 1
into, 1
small, 1
bits, 1
and, 1
flung, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
put, 1
on, 1
his, 1
travelling-cap,, 1
and, 1
calling, 1
his, 1
valet,, 1
checked, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
the, 1
thousand, 1
questions, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
ask,, 1
paid, 1
his, 1
bill,, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
ready,, 1
learned, 1
at, 1
Lyons, 1
that, 1
Bonaparte, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
Grenoble,, 1

in, 1
the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
tumult, 1
which, 1
prevailed, 1
along, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
at, 1
length, 1
reached, 1
Marseilles,, 1
a, 1
prey, 1
to, 1
all, 1
the, 1
hopes, 1

fears, 1
which, 1
enter, 1
into, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1

successes., 1
Chapter, 1
13., 1
The, 1
Hundred, 1
Days., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
a, 1
true, 1
prophet,, 1
and, 1
things, 1
progressed, 1
rapidly,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
predicted., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
knows, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
return, 1
from, 1
Elba,, 1
a, 1
return, 1
which, 1
was, 1
unprecedented, 1
in, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
probably, 1
remain, 1
without, 1
a, 1
counterpart, 1
in, 1
the, 1
future., 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
made, 1
but, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
parry, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
blow;, 1
the, 1
monarchy, 1
he, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
reconstructed, 1
tottered, 1
on, 1
its, 1
precarious, 1
foundation,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
the, 1
incongruous, 1
structure, 1
of, 1
ancient, 1
prejudices, 1
and, 1
new, 1
ideas, 1
fell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
Villefort,, 1
therefore,, 1
gained, 1
nothing, 1
save, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
gratitude, 1
(which, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
injure, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
present, 1
time), 1
and, 1
the, 1
cross, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
prudence, 1
not, 1
to, 1
wear,, 1
although, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Blacas, 1
had, 1
duly, 1
forwarded, 1
the, 1
brevet., 1
Napoleon, 1
would,, 1
doubtless,, 1
have, 1
deprived, 1
Villefort, 1
of, 1
his, 1
office, 1
had, 1
it, 1
not, 1
been, 1
for, 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
all, 1
powerful, 1
at, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
the, 1
Girondin, 1
of, 1
'93, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Senator, 1
of, 1
1806, 1
protected, 1
him, 1
who, 1
so, 1
lately, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his, 1
protector., 1
All, 1
Villefort's, 1
influence, 1
barely, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
stifle, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
so, 1
nearly, 1
divulged., 1
The, 1
king's, 1
procureur, 1
alone, 1
was, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
his, 1
office,, 1
being, 1
suspected, 1
of, 1
royalism., 1
However,, 1
scarcely, 1
was, 1
the, 1
imperial, 1
power, 1
established--that, 1
is,, 1
scarcely, 1
had, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
re-entered, 1
the, 1
Tuileries, 1
and, 1
begun, 1
to, 1
issue, 1
orders, 1
from, 1
the, 1
closet, 1
into, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
introduced, 1
our, 1
readers,--he, 1
found, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
there, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.'s, 1
half-filled, 1
snuff-box,--scarcely, 1
had, 1
this, 1
occurred, 1
when, 1
Marseilles, 1
began,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
authorities,, 1
to, 1
rekindle, 1
the, 1
flames, 1
of, 1
civil, 1
war,, 1
always, 1
smouldering, 1
in, 1
the, 1
south,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
required, 1
but, 1
little, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
the, 1
populace, 1
to, 1
acts, 1
of, 1
far, 1
greater, 1
violence, 1
than, 1
the, 1
shouts, 1
and, 1
insults, 1
with, 1
which, 1
they, 1
assailed, 1
the, 1
royalists, 1
whenever, 1
they, 1
ventured, 1
abroad., 1
Owing, 1
to, 1
this, 1
change,, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
shipowner, 1
became, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment--we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
say, 1
all, 1
powerful,, 1
because, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
a, 1
prudent, 1
and, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
timid, 1
man,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
so,, 1
that, 1
many, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
zealous, 1
partisans, 1
of, 1
Bonaparte, 1
accused, 1
him, 1
of, 1
"moderation"--but, 1
sufficiently, 1
influential, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
demand, 1
in, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
Dantes., 1
Villefort, 1
retained, 1
his, 1
place,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
marriage, 1
was, 1
put, 1
off, 1
until, 1
a, 1
more, 1
favorable, 1
opportunity., 1
If, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
the, 1
throne,, 1
Gerard, 1
required, 1
a, 1
different, 1
alliance, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
his, 1
career;, 1
if, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
returned,, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
like, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
could, 1
be, 1
vastly, 1
increased,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
be, 1
still, 1
more, 1
suitable., 1
The, 1
deputy-procureur, 1
was,, 1
therefore,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
magistrate, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
when, 1
one, 1
morning, 1
his, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
announced., 1
Any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
would, 1
have, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
ability,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
this, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
weakness., 1
He, 1
made, 1
Morrel, 1
wait, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
one, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
reason, 1
that, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
procureur, 1
always, 1
makes, 1
every, 1
one, 1
wait,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
passing, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
in, 1
reading, 1
the, 1
papers,, 1
he, 1
ordered, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
be, 1
admitted., 1
Morrel, 1
expected, 1
Villefort, 1
would, 1
be, 1
dejected;, 1
he, 1
found, 1
him, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
him, 1
six, 1
weeks, 1
before,, 1
calm,, 1
firm,, 1
and, 1
full, 1
of, 1
that, 1
glacial, 1
politeness,, 1
that, 1
most, 1
insurmountable, 1
barrier, 1
which, 1
separates, 1
the, 1
well-bred, 1
from, 1
the, 1
vulgar, 1
man., 1
He, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
Villefort's, 1
office, 1
expecting, 1
that, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
would, 1
tremble, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
shudder, 1
all, 1
over, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Villefort, 1
sitting, 1
there, 1
with, 1
his, 1
elbow, 1
on, 1
his, 1
desk,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
head, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
He, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
Villefort, 1
gazed, 1
at, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
some, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
recognizing, 1
him;, 1
then,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
interval,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
the, 1
honest, 1
shipowner, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands,--, 1
"M., 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
believe?", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir.", 1
"Come, 1
nearer,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
patronizing, 1
wave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1
"and, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
to, 1
what, 1
circumstance, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
this, 1
visit.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
guess,, 1
monsieur?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
I, 1
can, 1
serve, 1
you, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
delighted.", 1
"Everything, 1
depends, 1
on, 1
you.", 1
"Explain, 1
yourself,, 1
pray.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
recovering, 1
his, 1
assurance, 1
as, 1
he, 1
proceeded,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
recollect, 1
that, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days, 1
before, 1
the, 1
landing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
majesty, 1
the, 1
emperor,, 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
intercede, 1
for, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
the, 1
mate, 1
of, 1
my, 1
ship,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
accused, 1
of, 1
being, 1
concerned, 1
in, 1
correspondence, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba?, 1
What, 1
was, 1
the, 1
other, 1
day, 1
a, 1
crime, 1
is, 1
to-day, 1
a, 1
title, 1
to, 1
favor., 1
You, 1
then, 1
served, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
show, 1
any, 1
favor--it, 1
was, 1
your, 1
duty;, 1
to-day, 1
you, 1
serve, 1
Napoleon,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
protect, 1
him--it, 1
is, 1
equally, 1
your, 1
duty;, 1
I, 1
come,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
Villefort, 1
by, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
effort, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
control, 1
himself., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Tell, 1
me, 1
his, 1
name.", 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes.", 1
Villefort, 1
would, 1
probably, 1
have, 1
rather, 1
stood, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
muzzle, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
at, 1
five-and-twenty, 1
paces, 1
than, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
this, 1
name, 1
spoken;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
blanch., 1
"Dantes,", 1
repeated, 1
he,, 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes.", 1
"Yes,, 1
monsieur.", 1
Villefort, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
large, 1
register,, 1
then, 1
went, 1
to, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
table, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
registers,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Morrel,--, 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
mistaken,, 1
monsieur?", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
natural, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
Had, 1
Morrel, 1
been, 1
a, 1
more, 1
quick-sighted, 1
man,, 1
or, 1
better, 1
versed, 1
in, 1
these, 1
matters,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
procureur, 1
answering, 1
him, 1
on, 1
such, 1
a, 1
subject,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
referring, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prison, 1
or, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
of, 1
the, 1
department., 1
But, 1
Morrel,, 1
disappointed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
expectations, 1
of, 1
exciting, 1
fear,, 1
was, 1
conscious, 1
only, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other's, 1
condescension., 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
calculated, 1
rightly., 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mistaken., 1
I, 1
have, 1
known, 1
him, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
years,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
my, 1
service., 1
Do, 1
not, 1
you, 1
recollect,, 1
I, 1
came, 1
about, 1
six, 1
weeks, 1
ago, 1
to, 1
plead, 1
for, 1
clemency,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
come, 1
to-day, 1
to, 1
plead, 1
for, 1
justice., 1
You, 1
received, 1
me, 1
very, 1
coldly., 1
Oh,, 1
the, 1
royalists, 1
were, 1
very, 1
severe, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Bonapartists, 1
in, 1
those, 1
days.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
returned, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
then, 1
a, 1
royalist,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
believed, 1
the, 1
Bourbons, 1
not, 1
only, 1
the, 1
heirs, 1
to, 1
the, 1
throne,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
chosen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nation., 1
The, 1
miraculous, 1
return, 1
of, 1
Napoleon, 1
has, 1
conquered, 1
me,, 1
the, 1
legitimate, 1
monarch, 1
is, 1
he, 1
who, 1
is, 1
loved, 1
by, 1
his, 1
people.", 1
"That's, 1
right!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel., 1
"I, 1
like, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
thus,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
augur, 1
well, 1
for, 1
Edmond, 1
from, 1
it.", 1
"Wait, 1
a, 1
moment,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
a, 1
register;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
it--a, 1
sailor,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
a, 1
young, 1
Catalan, 1
girl., 1
I, 1
recollect, 1
now;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
serious, 1
charge.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
when, 1
he, 1
left, 1
here, 1
he, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice.", 1
"Well?", 1
"I, 1
made, 1
my, 1
report, 1
to, 1
the, 1
authorities, 1
at, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
week, 1
after, 1
he, 1
was, 1
carried, 1
off.", 1
"Carried, 1
off!", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"What, 1
can, 1
they, 1
have, 1
done, 1
with, 1
him?", 1
"Oh,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
Fenestrelles,, 1
to, 1
Pignerol,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Sainte-Marguerite, 1
islands., 1
Some, 1
fine, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
will, 1
return, 1
to, 1
take, 1
command, 1
of, 1
your, 1
vessel.", 1
"Come, 1
when, 1
he, 1
will,, 1
it, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
kept, 1
for, 1
him., 1
But, 1
how, 1
is, 1
it, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
already, 1
returned?, 1
It, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
the, 1
first, 1
care, 1
of, 1
government, 1
should, 1
be, 1
to, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
for, 1
their, 1
adherence, 1
to, 1
it.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
too, 1
hasty,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort., 1
"The, 1
order, 1
of, 1
imprisonment, 1
came, 1
from, 1
high, 1
authority,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
order, 1
for, 1
his, 1
liberation, 1
must, 1
proceed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
same, 1
source;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
Napoleon, 1
has, 1
scarcely, 1
been, 1
reinstated, 1
a, 1
fortnight,, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
have, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
been, 1
forwarded.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"is, 1
there, 1
no, 1
way, 1
of, 1
expediting, 1
all, 1
these, 1
formalities--of, 1
releasing, 1
him, 1
from, 1
arrest?", 1
"There, 1
has, 1
been, 1
no, 1
arrest.", 1
"How?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
sometimes, 1
essential, 1
to, 1
government, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
a, 1
man's, 1
disappearance, 1
without, 1
leaving, 1
any, 1
traces,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
no, 1
written, 1
forms, 1
or, 1
documents, 1
may, 1
defeat, 1
their, 1
wishes.", 1
"It, 1
might, 1
be, 1
so, 1
under, 1
the, 1
Bourbons,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
present"--, 1
"It, 1
has, 1
always, 1
been, 1
so,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Morrel,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
reign, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1
XIV., 1
The, 1
emperor, 1
is, 1
more, 1
strict, 1
in, 1
prison, 1
discipline, 1
than, 1
even, 1
Louis, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
prisoners, 1
whose, 1
names, 1
are, 1
not, 1
on, 1
the, 1
register, 1
is, 1
incalculable.", 1
Had, 1
Morrel, 1
even, 1
any, 1
suspicions,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
kindness, 1
would, 1
have, 1
dispelled, 1
them., 1
"Well,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
how, 1
would, 1
you, 1
advise, 1
me, 1
to, 1
act?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"Petition, 1
the, 1
minister.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
that, 1
is;, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
receives, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
petitions, 1
every, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
does, 1
not, 1
read, 1
three.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
true;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
will, 1
read, 1
a, 1
petition, 1
countersigned, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
by, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
will, 1
you, 1
undertake, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
it?", 1
"With, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
pleasure., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
then, 1
guilty,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
he, 1
is, 1
innocent,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
as, 1
much, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
to, 1
free, 1
him, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
condemn, 1
him.", 1
Villefort, 1
thus, 1
forestalled, 1
any, 1
danger, 1
of, 1
an, 1
inquiry,, 1
which,, 1
however, 1
improbable, 1
it, 1
might, 1
be,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
did, 1
take, 1
place, 1
would, 1
leave, 1
him, 1
defenceless., 1
"But, 1
how, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
address, 1
the, 1
minister?", 1
"Sit, 1
down, 1
there,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
giving, 1
up, 1
his, 1
place, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
"and, 1
write, 1
what, 1
I, 1
dictate.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
be, 1
so, 1
good?", 1
"Certainly., 1
But, 1
lose, 1
no, 1
time;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
too, 1
much, 1
already.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
true., 1
Only, 1
think, 1
what, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
fellow, 1
may, 1
even, 1
now, 1
be, 1
suffering.", 1
Villefort, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
suggestion;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
too, 1
far, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
back., 1
Dantes, 1
must, 1
be, 1
crushed, 1
to, 1
gratify, 1
Villefort's, 1
ambition., 1
Villefort, 1
dictated, 1
a, 1
petition,, 1
in, 1
which,, 1
from, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
intention,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
Dantes', 1
patriotic, 1
services, 1
were, 1
exaggerated,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
made, 1
out, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
active, 1
agents, 1
of, 1
Napoleon's, 1
return., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
this, 1
document, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
would, 1
instantly, 1
release, 1
him., 1
The, 1
petition, 1
finished,, 1
Villefort, 1
read, 1
it, 1
aloud., 1
"That, 1
will, 1
do,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"leave, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"Will, 1
the, 1
petition, 1
go, 1
soon?", 1
"To-day.", 1
"Countersigned, 1
by, 1
you?", 1
"The, 1
best, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
will, 1
be, 1
to, 1
certify, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
your, 1
petition.", 1
And,, 1
sitting, 1
down,, 1
Villefort, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
certificate, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom., 1
"What, 1
more, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
done?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
whatever, 1
is, 1
necessary.", 1
This, 1
assurance, 1
delighted, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
took, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
to, 1
old, 1
Dantes, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
soon, 1
see, 1
his, 1
son., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Villefort,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
sending, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
he, 1
carefully, 1
preserved, 1
the, 1
petition, 1
that, 1
so, 1
fearfully, 1
compromised, 1
Dantes,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
an, 1
event, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
not, 1
unlikely,--that, 1
is,, 1
a, 1
second, 1
restoration., 1
Dantes, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
prisoner,, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
not, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fall, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.'s, 1
throne,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
still, 1
more, 1
tragic, 1
destruction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
empire., 1
Twice, 1
during, 1
the, 1
Hundred, 1
Days, 1
had, 1
Morrel, 1
renewed, 1
his, 1
demand,, 1
and, 1
twice, 1
had, 1
Villefort, 1
soothed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
promises., 1
At, 1
last, 1
there, 1
was, 1
Waterloo,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
came, 1
no, 1
more;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
power,, 1
and, 1
any, 1
fresh, 1
attempt, 1
would, 1
only, 1
compromise, 1
himself, 1
uselessly., 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
remounted, 1
the, 1
throne;, 1
Villefort,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
Marseilles, 1
had, 1
become, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
remorseful, 1
memories,, 1
sought, 1
and, 1
obtained, 1
the, 1
situation, 1
of, 1
king's, 1
procureur, 1
at, 1
Toulouse,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
married, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
whose, 1
father, 1
now, 1
stood, 1
higher, 1
at, 1
court, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
And, 1
so, 1
Dantes,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
Hundred, 1
Days, 1
and, 1
after, 1
Waterloo,, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
forgotten, 1
of, 1
earth, 1
and, 1
heaven., 1
Danglars, 1
comprehended, 1
the, 1
full, 1
extent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
fate, 1
that, 1
overwhelmed, 1
Dantes;, 1
and,, 1
when, 1
Napoleon, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
France,, 1
he,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
mediocre, 1
minds,, 1
termed, 1
the, 1
coincidence,, 1
"a, 1
decree, 1
of, 1
Providence.", 1
But, 1
when, 1
Napoleon, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
Danglars', 1
heart, 1
failed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
Dantes', 1
return, 1
on, 1
a, 1
mission, 1
of, 1
vengeance., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
informed, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
obtained, 1
a, 1
recommendation, 1
from, 1
him, 1
to, 1
a, 1
Spanish, 1
merchant,, 1
into, 1
whose, 1
service, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
March,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
ten, 1
or, 1
twelve, 1
days, 1
after, 1
Napoleon's, 1
return., 1
He, 1
then, 1
left, 1
for, 1
Madrid,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
no, 1
more, 1
heard, 1
of., 1
Fernand, 1
understood, 1
nothing, 1
except, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
absent., 1
What, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
him, 1
he, 1
cared, 1
not, 1
to, 1
inquire., 1
Only,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
respite, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
rival, 1
afforded, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
reflected,, 1
partly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
deceiving, 1
Mercedes, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
absence,, 1
partly, 1
on, 1
plans, 1
of, 1
emigration, 1
and, 1
abduction,, 1
as, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
he, 1
sat, 1
sad, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
on, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
Cape, 1
Pharo,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
Marseilles, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
are, 1
visible,, 1
watching, 1
for, 1
the, 1
apparition, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
handsome, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
for, 1
him, 1
also, 1
the, 1
messenger, 1
of, 1
vengeance., 1
Fernand's, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
made, 1
up;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
shoot, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
kill, 1
himself., 1
But, 1
Fernand, 1
was, 1
mistaken;, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
his, 1
disposition, 1
never, 1
kills, 1
himself,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
constantly, 1
hopes., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
empire, 1
made, 1
its, 1
last, 1
conscription,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
man, 1
in, 1
France, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
bearing, 1
arms, 1
rushed, 1
to, 1
obey, 1
the, 1
summons, 1
of, 1
the, 1
emperor., 1
Fernand, 1
departed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
bearing, 1
with, 1
him, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
away,, 1
his, 1
rival, 1
would, 1
perhaps, 1
return, 1
and, 1
marry, 1
Mercedes., 1
Had, 1
Fernand, 1
really, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
so, 1
when, 1
he, 1
parted, 1
from, 1
Mercedes., 1
His, 1
devotion,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
compassion, 1
he, 1
showed, 1
for, 1
her, 1
misfortunes,, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
they, 1
always, 1
produce, 1
on, 1
noble, 1
minds--Mercedes, 1
had, 1
always, 1
had, 1
a, 1
sincere, 1
regard, 1
for, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
was, 1
now, 1
strengthened, 1
by, 1
gratitude., 1
"My, 1
brother,", 1
said, 1
she, 1
as, 1
she, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
knapsack, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulders,, 1
"be, 1
careful, 1
of, 1
yourself,, 1
for, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
killed,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
These, 1
words, 1
carried, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
hope, 1
into, 1
Fernand's, 1
heart., 1
Should, 1
Dantes, 1
not, 1
return,, 1
Mercedes, 1
might, 1
one, 1
day, 1
be, 1
his., 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
left, 1
alone, 1
face, 1
to, 1
face, 1
with, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
plain, 1
that, 1
had, 1
never, 1
seemed, 1
so, 1
barren,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
that, 1
had, 1
never, 1
seemed, 1
so, 1
vast., 1
Bathed, 1
in, 1
tears, 1
she, 1
wandered, 1
about, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
village., 1
Sometimes, 1
she, 1
stood, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
a, 1
statue,, 1
looking, 1
towards, 1
Marseilles,, 1
at, 1
other, 1
times, 1
gazing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
debating, 1
as, 1
to, 1
whether, 1
it, 1
were, 1
not, 1
better, 1
to, 1
cast, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
abyss, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
end, 1
her, 1
woes., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
want, 1
of, 1
courage, 1
that, 1
prevented, 1
her, 1
putting, 1
this, 1
resolution, 1
into, 1
execution;, 1
but, 1
her, 1
religious, 1
feelings, 1
came, 1
to, 1
her, 1
aid, 1
and, 1
saved, 1
her., 1
Caderousse, 1
was,, 1
like, 1
Fernand,, 1
enrolled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
army,, 1
but,, 1
being, 1
married, 1
and, 1
eight, 1
years, 1
older,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
merely, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
the, 1
frontier., 1
Old, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
only, 1
sustained, 1
by, 1
hope,, 1
lost, 1
all, 1
hope, 1
at, 1
Napoleon's, 1
downfall., 1
Five, 1
months, 1
after, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
his, 1
arrest,, 1
he, 1
breathed, 1
his, 1
last, 1
in, 1
Mercedes', 1
arms., 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
paid, 1
the, 1
expenses, 1
of, 1
his, 1
funeral,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
few, 1
small, 1
debts, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
man, 1
had, 1
contracted., 1
There, 1
was, 1
more, 1
than, 1
benevolence, 1
in, 1
this, 1
action;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
courage;, 1
the, 1
south, 1
was, 1
aflame,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
assist,, 1
even, 1
on, 1
his, 1
death-bed,, 1
the, 1
father, 1
of, 1
so, 1
dangerous, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist, 1
as, 1
Dantes,, 1
was, 1
stigmatized, 1
as, 1
a, 1
crime., 1
Chapter, 1
14., 1
The, 1
Two, 1
Prisoners., 1
A, 1
year, 1
after, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.'s, 1
restoration,, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
was, 1
made, 1
by, 1
the, 1
inspector-general, 1
of, 1
prisons., 1
Dantes, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cell, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
preparation,--sounds, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
where, 1
he, 1
lay, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
inaudible, 1
to, 1
any, 1
but, 1
the, 1
ear, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prisoner,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
splash, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drop, 1
of, 1
water, 1
that, 1
every, 1
hour, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon., 1
He, 1
guessed, 1
something, 1
uncommon, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
among, 1
the, 1
living;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
long, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
have, 1
any, 1
intercourse, 1
with, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
himself, 1
as, 1
dead., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
visited,, 1
one, 1
after, 1
another,, 1
the, 1
cells, 1
and, 1
dungeons, 1
of, 1
several, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoners,, 1
whose, 1
good, 1
behavior, 1
or, 1
stupidity, 1
recommended, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
clemency, 1
of, 1
the, 1
government., 1
He, 1
inquired, 1
how, 1
they, 1
were, 1
fed,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
they, 1
had, 1
any, 1
request, 1
to, 1
make., 1
The, 1
universal, 1
response, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
fare, 1
was, 1
detestable,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
they, 1
wanted, 1
to, 1
be, 1
set, 1
free., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
asked, 1
if, 1
they, 1
had, 1
anything, 1
else, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
for., 1
They, 1
shook, 1
their, 1
heads., 1
What, 1
could, 1
they, 1
desire, 1
beyond, 1
their, 1
liberty?, 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
turned, 1
smilingly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
what, 1
reason, 1
government, 1
can, 1
assign, 1
for, 1
these, 1
useless, 1
visits;, 1
when, 1
you, 1
see, 1
one, 1
prisoner,, 1
you, 1
see, 1
all,--always, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing,--ill, 1
fed, 1
and, 1
innocent., 1
Are, 1
there, 1
any, 1
others?", 1
"Yes;, 1
the, 1
dangerous, 1
and, 1
mad, 1
prisoners, 1
are, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dungeons.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
visit, 1
them,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
fatigue., 1
"We, 1
must, 1
play, 1
the, 1
farce, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
the, 1
dungeons.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
first, 1
send, 1
for, 1
two, 1
soldiers,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"The, 1
prisoners, 1
sometimes,, 1
through, 1
mere, 1
uneasiness, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sentenced, 1
to, 1
death,, 1
commit, 1
acts, 1
of, 1
useless, 1
violence,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
might, 1
fall, 1
a, 1
victim.", 1
"Take, 1
all, 1
needful, 1
precautions,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
Two, 1
soldiers, 1
were, 1
accordingly, 1
sent, 1
for,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
descended, 1
a, 1
stairway,, 1
so, 1
foul,, 1
so, 1
humid,, 1
so, 1
dark,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
loathsome, 1
to, 1
sight,, 1
smell,, 1
and, 1
respiration., 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
"who, 1
can, 1
live, 1
here?", 1
"A, 1
most, 1
dangerous, 1
conspirator,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
we, 1
are, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
the, 1
most, 1
strict, 1
watch, 1
over,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
is, 1
daring, 1
and, 1
resolute.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
alone?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"How, 1
long, 1
has, 1
he, 1
been, 1
there?", 1
"Nearly, 1
a, 1
year.", 1
"Was, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
here, 1
when, 1
he, 1
first, 1
arrived?", 1
"No;, 1
not, 1
until, 1
he, 1
attempted, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
the, 1
turnkey,, 1
who, 1
took, 1
his, 1
food, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"To, 1
kill, 1
the, 1
turnkey?", 1
"Yes,, 1
the, 1
very, 1
one, 1
who, 1
is, 1
lighting, 1
us., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
true,, 1
Antoine?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"True, 1
enough;, 1
he, 1
wanted, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
me!", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
turnkey., 1
"He, 1
must, 1
be, 1
mad,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
worse, 1
than, 1
that,--he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
devil!", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
turnkey., 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
complain, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"Oh,, 1
no;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
useless., 1
Besides,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
mad, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
another, 1
year, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
so.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better, 1
for, 1
him,--he, 1
will, 1
suffer, 1
less,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
this, 1
remark, 1
shows,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
full, 1
of, 1
philanthropy,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
every, 1
way, 1
fit, 1
for, 1
his, 1
office., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
governor;, 1
"and, 1
this, 1
remark, 1
proves, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
deeply, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
Now, 1
we, 1
have, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dungeon, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
feet, 1
distant,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
which, 1
you, 1
descend, 1
by, 1
another, 1
stair,, 1
an, 1
abbe,, 1
formerly, 1
leader, 1
of, 1
a, 1
party, 1
in, 1
Italy,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
been, 1
here, 1
since, 1
1811,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
1813, 1
he, 1
went, 1
mad,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
change, 1
is, 1
astonishing., 1
He, 1
used, 1
to, 1
weep,, 1
he, 1
now, 1
laughs;, 1
he, 1
grew, 1
thin,, 1
he, 1
now, 1
grows, 1
fat., 1
You, 1
had, 1
better, 1
see, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
madness, 1
is, 1
amusing.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
see, 1
them, 1
both,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
inspector;, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
conscientiously, 1
perform, 1
my, 1
duty.", 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
inspector's, 1
first, 1
visit;, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
display, 1
his, 1
authority., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
visit, 1
this, 1
one, 1
first,", 1
added, 1
he., 1
"By, 1
all, 1
means,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
turnkey, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
key, 1
turning, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hinges,, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
crouched, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dungeon,, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
that, 1
came, 1
through, 1
a, 1
narrow, 1
iron, 1
grating, 1
above,, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head., 1
Seeing, 1
a, 1
stranger,, 1
escorted, 1
by, 1
two, 1
turnkeys, 1
holding, 1
torches, 1
and, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
two, 1
soldiers,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
spoke, 1
bareheaded,, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
guessed, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
address, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
superior, 1
authorities, 1
was, 1
come,, 1
sprang, 1
forward, 1
with, 1
clasped, 1
hands., 1
The, 1
soldiers, 1
interposed, 1
their, 1
bayonets,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
attack, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
recoiled, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
steps., 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
dangerous., 1
Then,, 1
infusing, 1
all, 1
the, 1
humility, 1
he, 1
possessed, 1
into, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
voice,, 1
he, 1
addressed, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
and, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
inspire, 1
him, 1
with, 1
pity., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
listened, 1
attentively;, 1
then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
observed,, 1
"He, 1
will, 1
become, 1
religious--he, 1
is, 1
already, 1
more, 1
gentle;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
afraid,, 1
and, 1
retreated, 1
before, 1
the, 1
bayonets--madmen, 1
are, 1
not, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
anything;, 1
I, 1
made, 1
some, 1
curious, 1
observations, 1
on, 1
this, 1
at, 1
Charenton.", 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
want, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
crime, 1
I, 1
have, 1
committed--to, 1
be, 1
tried;, 1
and, 1

I, 1

guilty,, 1
to, 1

shot;, 1

innocent,, 1
to, 1

set, 1
at, 1
liberty.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
well, 1
fed?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
so;, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know;, 1
it's, 1
of, 1
no, 1
consequence., 1
What, 1
matters, 1
really,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
officers, 1
of, 1
justice, 1
and, 1
the, 1
king,, 1
is, 1
that, 1
an, 1
innocent, 1
man, 1
should, 1
languish, 1
in, 1
prison,, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
of, 1
an, 1
infamous, 1
denunciation,, 1

"You, 1
are, 1
very, 1
humble, 1
to-day,", 1

the, 1
governor;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
not, 1

other, 1
day,, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1

he, 1
his, 1
always, 1
been, 1
very, 1
good, 1
to, 1
me,, 1

I, 1
was, 1
mad.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
so, 1
any, 1
longer?", 1
"No;, 1
captivity, 1
has, 1
subdued, 1
me--I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
here, 1
so, 1
long.", 1
"So, 1
long?--when, 1
were, 1
you, 1
arrested,, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"The, 1
28th, 1

seventeen, 1
months,", 1

Dantes., 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1

seventeen, 1

to, 1

months, 1
captivity, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
boundless, 1
ocean,, 1

a, 1
worse, 1
punishment, 1
than, 1

pity, 1
on, 1

trial;, 1
not, 1

a, 1
verdict--a, 1
trial,, 1

ask, 1
only, 1
for, 1
a, 1
trial;, 1

"We, 1

"On, 1
my, 1

"Certainly;, 1

you, 1

you, 1

me--you, 1
can, 1
have, 1
me, 1
tried--and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
ask., 1
Let, 1
me, 1

my, 1
crime,, 1

"Go, 1
on, 1
with, 1
the, 1
lights,", 1

the, 1
inspector., 1
"Monsieur,", 1

Dantes,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1

"I, 1
cannot, 1

the, 1

you?", 1

him,, 1

now, 1

"I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
my, 1
detention,", 1

Dantes,, 1

my, 1

protector, 1
is, 1
removed.", 1
"Had, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
any, 1

of, 1
personal, 1
dislike, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"None;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
very, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
can,, 1
then,, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
the, 1
notes, 1
he, 1
has, 1
left, 1
concerning, 1
you?", 1
"Entirely.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
well;, 1
wait, 1
patiently,, 1
then.", 1
Dantes, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
prayed, 1
earnestly., 1
The, 1
door, 1
closed;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
time, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
inmate, 1
was, 1
left, 1
with, 1
Dantes--hope., 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
see, 1
the, 1
register, 1
at, 1
once,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1

proceed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
cell?", 1

us, 1
visit, 1
them, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"If, 1
I, 1
once, 1
went, 1
up, 1
those, 1
stairs., 1
I, 1
should, 1
never, 1
have, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
to, 1

down, 1
again.", 1
"Ah,, 1
this, 1
one, 1
is, 1
not, 1
like, 1
the, 1
other,, 1

his, 1
madness, 1
is, 1
less, 1
affecting, 1

"What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
folly?", 1
"He, 1
fancies, 1

immense, 1
treasure., 1

"How, 1
curious!--what, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"The, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria.", 1
"No., 1
27,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
here;, 1
unlock, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
Antoine.", 1
The, 1
turnkey, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
gazed, 1
curiously, 1
into, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
the, 1
"mad, 1
abbe.", 1
In, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cell,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
circle, 1
traced, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fragment, 1
of, 1
plaster, 1
detached, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
sat, 1
a, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
tattered, 1
garments, 1
scarcely, 1
covered, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was, 1
drawing, 1
in, 1
this, 1
circle, 1
geometrical, 1
lines,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
much, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
problem, 1
as, 1
Archimedes, 1
was, 1
when, 1
the, 1
soldier, 1
of, 1
Marcellus, 1
slew, 1
him., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
move, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
his, 1
calculations, 1
until, 1
the, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
the, 1
torches, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
with, 1
an, 1
unwonted, 1
glare, 1
the, 1
sombre, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell;, 1
then,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
persons, 1
present., 1
He, 1
hastily, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
coverlet, 1
of, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
wrapped, 1
it, 1
round, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"I,, 1
monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
surprise--"I, 1
want, 1
nothing.", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
inspector;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sent, 1
here, 1
by, 1
government, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1

hear, 1
the, 1
requests, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoners.", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
different,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"and, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
understand, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
I, 1
hope.", 1
"There,, 1
now,", 1
whispered, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
just, 1
as, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1

for, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
Cardinal, 1

beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
year, 1

my, 1
liberty, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
and, 1
French, 1
government.", 1
"Why, 1
from, 1
the, 1
French, 1
government?", 1
"Because, 1
I, 1
was, 1
arrested, 1
at, 1
Piombino,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
presume, 1
that,, 1
like, 1
Milan, 1
and, 1
Florence,, 1
Piombino, 1
has, 1
become, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
some, 1
French, 1
department.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1

have, 1
not, 1
the, 1
latest, 1
news, 1
from, 1
Italy?", 1

information, 1
dates, 1
from, 1
the, 1
day, 1
on, 1
which, 1
I, 1
was, 1
arrested,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria;, 1
"and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
had, 1
created, 1
the, 1
kingdom, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1
for, 1
his, 1
infant, 1
son,, 1
I, 1

that, 1

has, 1
realized, 1
the, 1
dream, 1
of, 1
Machiavelli, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia,, 1

was, 1
to, 1
make, 1
Italy, 1
a, 1
united, 1
kingdom.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
"providence, 1
has, 1
changed, 1
this, 1
gigantic, 1
plan, 1
you, 1
advocate, 1
so, 1
warmly.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1

of, 1
rendering, 1
Italy, 1
strong,, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
independent.", 1
"Very, 1

only, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1

prisons,--that, 1
is,, 1

bad;, 1

importance.", 1
"We, 1
are, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point,", 1
whispered, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
for, 1
that, 1
reason, 1
I, 1
am, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1

you,", 1

you, 1
have, 1
disturbed, 1
me, 1
in, 1
a, 1
most, 1
important, 1
calculation,, 1

if, 1
it, 1
succeeded,, 1
would, 1
possibly, 1
change, 1
Newton's, 1
system., 1

you, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
in, 1

"What, 1
did, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you?", 1

the, 1
governor., 1

knew, 1
him,", 1

the, 1
inspector, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"What, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
is, 1
impossible,, 1
monsieur,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
addressing, 1
Faria., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you, 1
of, 1
a, 1
large, 1
sum,, 1
amounting, 1
to, 1
five, 1
millions.", 1
"The, 1
very, 1
sum, 1
you, 1
named,", 1
whispered, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn., 1
"However,", 1
continued, 1
Faria,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
depart,, 1

is, 1
not, 1
absolutely, 1
necessary, 1

us, 1
to, 1

you, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1
say;, 1
it, 1
concerns, 1
your, 1
treasures,, 1

it, 1
not?", 1
Faria, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
him, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
convinced, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sanity., 1
"Of, 1
course,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"of, 1
what, 1
else, 1
should, 1
I, 1
speak?", 1
"Mr., 1
Inspector,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
story, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
he,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
has, 1
been, 1
dinned, 1
in, 1
my, 1
ears, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
years.", 1
"That, 1
proves,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Holy, 1
Writ,, 1
who, 1
having, 1
ears, 1
hear, 1
not,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
eyes, 1
see, 1
not.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
the, 1
government, 1
is, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
does, 1
not, 1
want, 1
your, 1
treasures,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
inspector;, 1
"keep, 1
them, 1
until, 1
you, 1
are, 1
liberated.", 1
The, 1
abbe's, 1
eyes, 1
glistened;, 1
he, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
inspector's, 1
hand., 1
"But, 1
what, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
liberated,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
"and, 1
am, 1
detained, 1
here, 1
until, 1
my, 1
death?, 1
this, 1
treasure, 1
will, 1
be, 1
lost., 1
Had, 1
not, 1
government, 1
better, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
it?, 1
I, 1
will, 1
offer, 1
six, 1
millions,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
content, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
if, 1
they, 1
will, 1
only, 1
give, 1
me, 1
my, 1
liberty.", 1
"On, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
"had, 1
I, 1
not, 1
been, 1
told, 1
beforehand, 1
that, 1
this, 1
man, 1
was, 1
mad,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
believe, 1
what, 1
he, 1
says.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mad,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
acuteness, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
prisoners., 1
"The, 1
treasure, 1
I, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
really, 1
exists,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
offer, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
an, 1
agreement, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
dig;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
deceive, 1
you,, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
here, 1
again,--I, 1
ask, 1
no, 1
more.", 1
The, 1
governor, 1
laughed., 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
far, 1
from, 1
here?", 1
"A, 1
hundred, 1
leagues.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
ill-planned,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"If, 1
all, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
took, 1
it, 1
into, 1
their, 1
heads, 1
to, 1
travel, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
leagues,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
guardians, 1
consented, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
them,, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
a, 1
capital, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
escaping.", 1
"The, 1
scheme, 1
is, 1
well, 1
known,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector;, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
plan, 1
has, 1
not, 1
even, 1
the, 1
merit, 1
of, 1
originality.", 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Faria--"I, 1
inquired, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
well, 1
fed?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Swear, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
"to, 1
free, 1
me, 1
if, 1
what, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
prove, 1
true,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
stay, 1
here, 1
while, 1
you, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
well, 1
fed?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"Monsieur,, 1
you, 1
run, 1
no, 1
risk,, 1
for,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
stay, 1
here;, 1
so, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
my, 1
escaping.", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
my, 1
question,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
impatiently., 1
"Nor, 1
you, 1
to, 1
mine,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
not, 1
accept, 1
my, 1
gold;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
keep, 1
it, 1
for, 1
myself., 1
You, 1
refuse, 1
me, 1
my, 1
liberty;, 1
God, 1
will, 1
give, 1
it, 1
me.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
casting, 1
away, 1
his, 1
coverlet,, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
his, 1
calculations., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
he, 1
doing, 1
there?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"Counting, 1
his, 1
treasures,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
Faria, 1
replied, 1
to, 1
this, 1
sarcasm, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
contempt., 1
They, 1
went, 1
out., 1
The, 1
turnkey, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
behind, 1
them., 1
"He, 1
was, 1
wealthy, 1
once,, 1
perhaps?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector., 1
"Or, 1
dreamed, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
and, 1
awoke, 1
mad.", 1
"After, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
"if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
rich,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
here.", 1
So, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
ended, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria., 1
He, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
visit, 1
only, 1
increased, 1
the, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
his, 1
insanity., 1
Caligula, 1
or, 1
Nero,, 1
those, 1
treasure-seekers,, 1
those, 1
desirers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
impossible,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
accorded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
wretch,, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
for, 1
his, 1
wealth,, 1
the, 1
liberty, 1
he, 1
so, 1
earnestly, 1
prayed, 1
for., 1
But, 1
the, 1
kings, 1
of, 1
modern, 1
times,, 1
restrained, 1
by, 1
the, 1
limits, 1
of, 1
mere, 1
probability,, 1
have, 1
neither, 1
courage, 1
nor, 1
desire., 1
They, 1
fear, 1
the, 1
ear, 1
that, 1
hears, 1
their, 1
orders,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
that, 1
scrutinizes, 1
their, 1
actions., 1
Formerly, 1
they, 1
believed, 1
themselves, 1
sprung, 1
from, 1
Jupiter,, 1
and, 1
shielded, 1
by, 1
their, 1
birth;, 1
but, 1
nowadays, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not, 1
inviolable., 1
It, 1
has, 1
always, 1
been, 1
against, 1
the, 1
policy, 1
of, 1
despotic, 1
governments, 1
to, 1
suffer, 1
the, 1
victims, 1
of, 1
their, 1
persecutions, 1
to, 1
reappear., 1
As, 1
the, 1
Inquisition, 1
rarely, 1
allowed, 1
its, 1
victims, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
with, 1
their, 1
limbs, 1
distorted, 1
and, 1
their, 1
flesh, 1
lacerated, 1
by, 1
torture,, 1
so, 1
madness, 1
is, 1
always, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
its, 1
cell,, 1
from, 1
whence,, 1
should, 1
it, 1
depart,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
conveyed, 1
to, 1
some, 1
gloomy, 1
hospital,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
has, 1
no, 1
thought, 1
for, 1
man, 1
or, 1
mind, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mutilated, 1
being, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
delivers, 1
to, 1
him., 1
The, 1
very, 1
madness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1
gone, 1
mad, 1
in, 1
prison,, 1
condemned, 1
him, 1
to, 1
perpetual, 1
captivity., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
word, 1
with, 1
Dantes;, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
register,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
the, 1
following, 1
note, 1
concerning, 1
him:--, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes:, 1
Violent, 1
Bonapartist;, 1
took, 1
an, 1
active, 1
part, 1
in, 1
the, 1
return, 1
from, 1
Elba., 1
The, 1
greatest, 1
watchfulness, 1
and, 1
care, 1
to, 1
be, 1
exercised., 1
This, 1
note, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
different, 1
hand, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
which, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
added, 1
since, 1
his, 1
confinement., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
could, 1
not, 1
contend, 1
against, 1
this, 1
accusation;, 1
he, 1
simply, 1
wrote,--"Nothing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
done.", 1
This, 1
visit, 1
had, 1
infused, 1
new, 1
vigor, 1
into, 1
Dantes;, 1
he, 1
had,, 1
till, 1
then,, 1
forgotten, 1
the, 1
date;, 1
but, 1
now,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fragment, 1
of, 1
plaster,, 1
he, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
date,, 1
30th, 1
July,, 1
1816,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
a, 1
mark, 1
every, 1
day,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
his, 1
reckoning, 1
again., 1
Days, 1
and, 1
weeks, 1
passed, 1
away,, 1
then, 1
months--Dantes, 1
still, 1
waited;, 1
he, 1
at, 1
first, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
be, 1
freed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fortnight., 1
This, 1
fortnight, 1
expired,, 1
he, 1
decided, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
would, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
until, 1
his, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
reach, 1
there, 1
until, 1
his, 1
circuit, 1
was, 1
finished,, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
fixed, 1
three, 1
months;, 1
three, 1
months, 1
passed, 1
away,, 1
then, 1
six, 1
more., 1
Finally, 1
ten, 1
months, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
by, 1
and, 1
no, 1
favorable, 1
change, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
began, 1
to, 1
fancy, 1
the, 1
inspector's, 1
visit, 1
but, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
an, 1
illusion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brain., 1
At, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
a, 1
year, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
was, 1
transferred;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
obtained, 1
charge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fortress, 1
at, 1
Ham., 1
He, 1
took, 1
with, 1
him, 1
several, 1
of, 1
his, 1
subordinates,, 1
and, 1
amongst, 1
them, 1
Dantes', 1
jailer., 1
A, 1
new, 1
governor, 1
arrived;, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
too, 1
tedious, 1
to, 1
acquire, 1
the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoners;, 1
he, 1
learned, 1
their, 1
numbers, 1
instead., 1
This, 1
horrible, 1
place, 1
contained, 1
fifty, 1
cells;, 1
their, 1
inhabitants, 1
were, 1
designated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
numbers, 1
of, 1
their, 1
cell,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
called, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes--he, 1
was, 1
now, 1
number, 1
34., 1
Chapter, 1
15., 1
Number, 1
34, 1
and, 1
Number, 1
27., 1
Dantes, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
all, 1
the, 1
stages, 1
of, 1
torture, 1
natural, 1
to, 1
prisoners, 1
in, 1
suspense., 1
He, 1
was, 1
sustained, 1
at, 1
first, 1
by, 1
that, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
conscious, 1
innocence, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
sequence, 1
to, 1
hope;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
doubt, 1
his, 1
own, 1
innocence,, 1
which, 1
justified, 1
in, 1
some, 1
measure, 1
the, 1
governor's, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mental, 1
alienation;, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
relaxing, 1
his, 1
sentiment, 1
of, 1
pride,, 1
he, 1
addressed, 1
his, 1
supplications,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
God,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
man., 1
God, 1
is, 1
always, 1
the, 1
last, 1
resource., 1
Unfortunates,, 1
who, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
with, 1
God,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
have, 1
any, 1
hope, 1
in, 1
him, 1
till, 1
they, 1
have, 1
exhausted, 1
all, 1
other, 1
means, 1
of, 1
deliverance., 1
Dantes, 1
asked, 1
to, 1
be, 1
removed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
present, 1
dungeon, 1
into, 1
another;, 1
for, 1
a, 1
change,, 1
however, 1
disadvantageous,, 1
was, 1
still, 1
a, 1
change,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
afford, 1
him, 1
some, 1
amusement., 1
He, 1
entreated, 1
to, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
about,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
fresh, 1
air,, 1
books,, 1
and, 1
writing, 1
materials., 1
His, 1
requests, 1
were, 1
not, 1
granted,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
asking, 1
all, 1
the, 1
same., 1
He, 1
accustomed, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
new, 1
jailer,, 1
although, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
was,, 1
if, 1
possible,, 1
more, 1
taciturn, 1
than, 1
the, 1
old, 1
one;, 1
but, 1
still,, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
even, 1
though, 1
mute,, 1
was, 1
something., 1
Dantes, 1
spoke, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
his, 1
own, 1
voice;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
when, 1
alone,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
terrified, 1
him., 1
Often,, 1
before, 1
his, 1
captivity,, 1
Dantes', 1
mind, 1
had, 1
revolted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
assemblages, 1
of, 1
prisoners,, 1
made, 1
up, 1
of, 1
thieves,, 1
vagabonds,, 1
and, 1
murderers., 1
He, 1
now, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
be, 1
amongst, 1
them,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
see, 1
some, 1
other, 1
face, 1
besides, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
jailer;, 1
he, 1
sighed, 1
for, 1
the, 1
galleys,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
infamous, 1
costume,, 1
the, 1
chain,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
brand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shoulder., 1
The, 1
galley-slaves, 1
breathed, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
air, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
each, 1
other., 1
They, 1
were, 1
very, 1
happy., 1
He, 1
besought, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
one, 1
day, 1
to, 1
let, 1
him, 1
have, 1
a, 1
companion,, 1
were, 1
it, 1
even, 1
the, 1
mad, 1
abbe., 1
The, 1
jailer,, 1
though, 1
rough, 1
and, 1
hardened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
constant, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
so, 1
much, 1
suffering,, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
a, 1
man., 1
At, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
he, 1
had, 1
often, 1
had, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
pity, 1
for, 1
this, 1
unhappy, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
suffered, 1
so;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
request, 1
of, 1
number, 1
34, 1
before, 1
the, 1
governor;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
sapiently, 1
imagined, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
conspire, 1
or, 1
attempt, 1
an, 1
escape,, 1
and, 1
refused, 1
his, 1
request., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
exhausted, 1
all, 1
human, 1
resources,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
God., 1
All, 1
the, 1
pious, 1
ideas, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
long, 1
forgotten,, 1
returned;, 1
he, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
prayers, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
had, 1
taught, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
discovered, 1
a, 1
new, 1
meaning, 1
in, 1
every, 1
word;, 1
for, 1
in, 1
prosperity, 1
prayers, 1
seem, 1
but, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
medley, 1
of, 1
words,, 1
until, 1
misfortune, 1
comes, 1
and, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
sufferer, 1
first, 1
understands, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sublime, 1
language, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
invokes, 1
the, 1
pity, 1
of, 1
heaven!, 1
He, 1
prayed,, 1
and, 1
prayed, 1
aloud,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
terrified, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
voice,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
ecstasy., 1
He, 1
laid, 1
every, 1
action, 1
of, 1
his, 1
life, 1
before, 1
the, 1
Almighty,, 1
proposed, 1
tasks, 1
to, 1
accomplish,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
every, 1
prayer, 1
introduced, 1
the, 1
entreaty, 1
oftener, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
man, 1
than, 1
to, 1
God:, 1
"Forgive, 1
us, 1
our, 1
trespasses, 1
as, 1
we, 1
forgive, 1
them, 1
that, 1
trespass, 1
against, 1
us.", 1
Yet, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
earnest, 1
prayers,, 1
Dantes, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
prisoner., 1
Then, 1
gloom, 1
settled, 1
heavily, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
great, 1
simplicity, 1
of, 1
thought,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
education;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not,, 1
therefore,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
solitude, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
traverse, 1
in, 1
mental, 1
vision, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ages,, 1
bring, 1
to, 1
life, 1
the, 1
nations, 1
that, 1
had, 1
perished,, 1
and, 1
rebuild, 1
the, 1
ancient, 1
cities, 1
so, 1
vast, 1
and, 1
stupendous, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
imagination,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
pass, 1
before, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
glowing, 1
with, 1
celestial, 1
colors, 1
in, 1
Martin's, 1
Babylonian, 1
pictures., 1
He, 1
could, 1
not, 1
do, 1
this,, 1
he, 1
whose, 1
past, 1
life, 1
was, 1
so, 1
short,, 1
whose, 1
present, 1
so, 1
melancholy,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
future, 1
so, 1
doubtful., 1
Nineteen, 1
years, 1
of, 1
light, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
upon, 1
in, 1
eternal, 1
darkness!, 1
No, 1
distraction, 1
could, 1
come, 1
to, 1
his, 1
aid;, 1
his, 1
energetic, 1
spirit,, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
exalted, 1
in, 1
thus, 1
revisiting, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
was, 1
imprisoned, 1
like, 1
an, 1
eagle, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cage., 1
He, 1
clung, 1
to, 1
one, 1
idea--that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
happiness,, 1
destroyed,, 1
without, 1
apparent, 1
cause,, 1
by, 1
an, 1
unheard-of, 1
fatality;, 1
he, 1
considered, 1
and, 1
reconsidered, 1
this, 1
idea,, 1
devoured, 1
it, 1
(so, 1
to, 1
speak),, 1
as, 1
the, 1
implacable, 1
Ugolino, 1
devours, 1
the, 1
skull, 1
of, 1
Archbishop, 1
Roger, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Inferno, 1
of, 1
Dante., 1
Rage, 1
supplanted, 1
religious, 1
fervor., 1
Dantes, 1
uttered, 1
blasphemies, 1
that, 1
made, 1
his, 1
jailer, 1
recoil, 1
with, 1
horror,, 1
dashed, 1
himself, 1
furiously, 1
against, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
his, 1
prison,, 1
wreaked, 1
his, 1
anger, 1
upon, 1
everything,, 1
and, 1
chiefly, 1
upon, 1
himself,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
least, 1
thing,--a, 1
grain, 1
of, 1
sand,, 1
a, 1
straw,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
breath, 1
of, 1
air, 1
that, 1
annoyed, 1
him,, 1
led, 1
to, 1
paroxysms, 1
of, 1
fury., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
showed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
recurred, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
line, 1
gleamed, 1
forth, 1
in, 1
fiery, 1
letters, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
like, 1
the, 1
mene, 1
tekel, 1
upharsin, 1
of, 1
Belshazzar., 1
He, 1
told, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
enmity, 1
of, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
the, 1
vengeance, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
that, 1
had, 1
thus, 1
plunged, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
misery., 1
He, 1
consigned, 1
his, 1
unknown, 1
persecutors, 1
to, 1
the, 1
most, 1
horrible, 1
tortures, 1
he, 1
could, 1
imagine,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
them, 1
all, 1
insufficient,, 1
because, 1
after, 1
torture, 1
came, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
death,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
repose,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
the, 1
boon, 1
of, 1
unconsciousness., 1
By, 1
dint, 1
of, 1
constantly, 1
dwelling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
tranquillity, 1
was, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
punishment, 1
were, 1
the, 1
end, 1
in, 1
view, 1
other, 1
tortures, 1
than, 1
death, 1
must, 1
be, 1
invented,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
on, 1
suicide., 1
Unhappy, 1
he,, 1
who,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brink, 1
of, 1
misfortune,, 1
broods, 1
over, 1
ideas, 1
like, 1
these!, 1
Before, 1
him, 1
is, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
sea, 1
that, 1
stretches, 1
in, 1
azure, 1
calm, 1
before, 1
the, 1
eye;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
who, 1
unwarily, 1
ventures, 1
within, 1
its, 1
embrace, 1
finds, 1
himself, 1
struggling, 1
with, 1
a, 1
monster, 1
that, 1
would, 1
drag, 1
him, 1
down, 1
to, 1
perdition., 1
Once, 1
thus, 1
ensnared,, 1
unless, 1
the, 1
protecting, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
God, 1
snatch, 1
him, 1
thence,, 1
all, 1
is, 1
over,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
struggles, 1
but, 1
tend, 1
to, 1
hasten, 1
his, 1
destruction., 1
This, 1
state, 1
of, 1
mental, 1
anguish, 1
is,, 1
however,, 1
less, 1
terrible, 1
than, 1
the, 1
sufferings, 1
that, 1
precede, 1
or, 1
the, 1
punishment, 1
that, 1
possibly, 1
will, 1
follow., 1
There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
consolation, 1
at, 1
the, 1
contemplation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yawning, 1
abyss,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
which, 1
lie, 1
darkness, 1
and, 1
obscurity., 1
Edmond, 1
found, 1
some, 1
solace, 1
in, 1
these, 1
ideas., 1
All, 1
his, 1
sorrows,, 1
all, 1
his, 1
sufferings,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
train, 1
of, 1
gloomy, 1
spectres,, 1
fled, 1
from, 1
his, 1
cell, 1
when, 1
the, 1
angel, 1
of, 1
death, 1
seemed, 1
about, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
Dantes, 1
reviewed, 1
his, 1
past, 1
life, 1
with, 1
composure,, 1
and,, 1
looking, 1
forward, 1
with, 1
terror, 1
to, 1
his, 1
future, 1
existence,, 1
chose, 1
that, 1
middle, 1
line, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
afford, 1
him, 1
a, 1
refuge., 1
"Sometimes,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"in, 1
my, 1
voyages,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
and, 1
commanded, 1
other, 1
men,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
heavens, 1
overcast,, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
rage, 1
and, 1
foam,, 1
the, 1
storm, 1
arise,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
monstrous, 1
bird,, 1
beating, 1
the, 1
two, 1
horizons, 1
with, 1
its, 1
wings., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
my, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
a, 1
vain, 1
refuge,, 1
that, 1
trembled, 1
and, 1
shook, 1
before, 1
the, 1
tempest., 1
Soon, 1
the, 1
fury, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
rocks, 1
announced, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
death, 1
then, 1
terrified, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
used, 1
all, 1
my, 1
skill, 1
and, 1
intelligence, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wrath, 1
of, 1
God., 1
But, 1
I, 1
did, 1
so, 1
because, 1
I, 1
was, 1
happy,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
courted, 1
death,, 1
because, 1
to, 1
be, 1
cast, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
rocks, 1
and, 1
seaweed, 1
seemed, 1
terrible,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
was, 1
unwilling, 1
that, 1
I,, 1
a, 1
creature, 1
made, 1
for, 1
the, 1
service, 1
of, 1
God,, 1
should, 1
serve, 1
for, 1
food, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gulls, 1
and, 1
ravens., 1
But, 1
now, 1
it, 1
is, 1
different;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
all, 1
that, 1
bound, 1
me, 1
to, 1
life,, 1
death, 1
smiles, 1
and, 1
invites, 1
me, 1
to, 1
repose;, 1
I, 1
die, 1
after, 1
my, 1
own, 1
manner,, 1
I, 1
die, 1
exhausted, 1
and, 1
broken-spirited,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
fall, 1
asleep, 1
when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
paced, 1
three, 1
thousand, 1
times, 1
round, 1
my, 1
cell.", 1
No, 1
sooner, 1
had, 1
this, 1
idea, 1
taken, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
him, 1
than, 1
he, 1
became, 1
more, 1
composed,, 1
arranged, 1
his, 1
couch, 1
to, 1
the, 1
best, 1
of, 1
his, 1
power,, 1
ate, 1
little, 1
and, 1
slept, 1
less,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
existence, 1
almost, 1
supportable,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
throw, 1
it, 1
off, 1
at, 1
pleasure,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
worn-out, 1
garment., 1
Two, 1
methods, 1
of, 1
self-destruction, 1
were, 1
at, 1
his, 1
disposal., 1
He, 1
could, 1
hang, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window, 1
bars,, 1
or, 1
refuse, 1
food, 1
and, 1
die, 1
of, 1
starvation., 1
But, 1
the, 1
first, 1
was, 1
repugnant, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
always, 1
entertained, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
horror, 1
of, 1
pirates,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
hung, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
yard-arm;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
die, 1
by, 1
what, 1
seemed, 1
an, 1
infamous, 1
death., 1
He, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
adopt, 1
the, 1
second,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
that, 1
day, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
out, 1
his, 1
resolve., 1
Nearly, 1
four, 1
years, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
away;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
mark, 1
the, 1
lapse, 1
of, 1
time., 1
Dantes, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
die,", 1
and, 1
had, 1
chosen, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
his, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
fearful, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
an, 1
oath, 1
to, 1
die., 1
"When, 1
my, 1
morning, 1
and, 1
evening, 1
meals, 1
are, 1
brought,", 1
thought, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
cast, 1
them, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
will, 1
think, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
eaten, 1
them.", 1
He, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
word;, 1
twice, 1
a, 1
day, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
out,, 1
through, 1
the, 1
barred, 1
aperture,, 1
the, 1
provisions, 1
his, 1
jailer, 1
brought, 1
him--at, 1
first, 1
gayly,, 1
then, 1
with, 1
deliberation,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
last, 1
with, 1
regret., 1
Nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
his, 1
oath, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
proceed., 1
Hunger, 1
made, 1
viands, 1
once, 1
repugnant,, 1
now, 1
acceptable;, 1
he, 1
held, 1
the, 1
plate, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
for, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
at, 1
a, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
gazed, 1
thoughtfully, 1
at, 1
the, 1
morsel, 1
of, 1
bad, 1
meat,, 1
of, 1
tainted, 1
fish,, 1
of, 1
black, 1
and, 1
mouldy, 1
bread., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
last, 1
yearning, 1
for, 1
life, 1
contending, 1
with, 1
the, 1
resolution, 1
of, 1
despair;, 1
then, 1
his, 1
dungeon, 1
seemed, 1
less, 1
sombre,, 1
his, 1
prospects, 1
less, 1
desperate., 1
He, 1
was, 1
still, 1
young--he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty--he, 1
had, 1
nearly, 1
fifty, 1
years, 1
to, 1
live., 1
What, 1
unforseen, 1
events, 1
might, 1
not, 1
open, 1
his, 1
prison, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
restore, 1
him, 1
to, 1
liberty?, 1
Then, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
the, 1
repast, 1
that,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
voluntary, 1
Tantalus,, 1
he, 1
refused, 1
himself;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
his, 1
oath,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
break, 1
it., 1
He, 1
persisted, 1
until,, 1
at, 1
last,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
sufficient, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
rise, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
supper, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
loophole., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
or, 1
hear;, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
feared, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dangerously, 1
ill., 1
Edmond, 1
hoped, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dying., 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
day, 1
passed, 1
away., 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
stupor, 1
creeping, 1
over, 1
him, 1
which, 1
brought, 1
with, 1
it, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
almost, 1
of, 1
content;, 1
the, 1
gnawing, 1
pain, 1
at, 1
his, 1
stomach, 1
had, 1
ceased;, 1
his, 1
thirst, 1
had, 1
abated;, 1
when, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
myriads, 1
of, 1
lights, 1
dancing, 1
before, 1
them, 1
like, 1
the, 1
will-o'-the-wisps, 1
that, 1
play, 1
about, 1
the, 1
marshes., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
twilight, 1
of, 1
that, 1
mysterious, 1
country, 1
called, 1
Death!, 1
Suddenly,, 1
about, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
Edmond, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
hollow, 1
sound, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
against, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
lying., 1
So, 1
many, 1
loathsome, 1
animals, 1
inhabited, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
that, 1
their, 1
noise, 1
did, 1
not,, 1
in, 1
general,, 1
awake, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
whether, 1
abstinence, 1
had, 1
quickened, 1
his, 1
faculties,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
was, 1
really, 1
louder, 1
than, 1
usual,, 1
Edmond, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
listened., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
continual, 1
scratching,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
made, 1
by, 1
a, 1
huge, 1
claw,, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
tooth,, 1
or, 1
some, 1
iron, 1
instrument, 1
attacking, 1
the, 1
stones., 1
Although, 1
weakened,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
brain, 1
instantly, 1
responded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
haunts, 1
all, 1
prisoners--liberty!, 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
heaven, 1
had, 1
at, 1
length, 1
taken, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
this, 1
noise, 1
to, 1
warn, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
very, 1
brink, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abyss., 1
Perhaps, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
beloved, 1
ones, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
was, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
diminish, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
that, 1
separated, 1
them., 1
No,, 1
no,, 1
doubtless, 1
he, 1
was, 1
deceived,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
but, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
dreams, 1
that, 1
forerun, 1
death!, 1
Edmond, 1
still, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound., 1
It, 1
lasted, 1
nearly, 1
three, 1
hours;, 1
he, 1
then, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
something, 1
falling,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
was, 1
silent., 1
Some, 1
hours, 1
afterwards, 1
it, 1
began, 1
again,, 1
nearer, 1
and, 1
more, 1
distinct., 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
intensely, 1
interested., 1
Suddenly, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
entered., 1
For, 1
a, 1
week, 1
since, 1
he, 1
had, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
the, 1
four, 1
days, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
carrying, 1
out, 1
his, 1
purpose,, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
not, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
attendant,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
answered, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
inquired, 1
what, 1
was, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
face, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
when, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
too, 1
curiously, 1
at, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
now, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
might, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
put, 1
an, 1
end, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
destroy, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
something, 1
like, 1
hope, 1
that, 1
soothed, 1
his, 1
last, 1
moments., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
his, 1
breakfast., 1
Dantes, 1
raised, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
about, 1
everything;, 1
about, 1
the, 1
bad, 1
quality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
food,, 1
about, 1
the, 1
coldness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
grumbling, 1
and, 1
complaining,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
have, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
for, 1
speaking, 1
louder,, 1
and, 1
wearying, 1
the, 1
patience, 1
of, 1
his, 1
jailer,, 1
who, 1
out, 1
of, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
heart, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
broth, 1
and, 1
white, 1
bread, 1
for, 1
his, 1
prisoner., 1
Fortunately,, 1
he, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
delirious;, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
the, 1
food, 1
on, 1
the, 1
rickety, 1
table,, 1
he, 1
withdrew., 1
Edmond, 1
listened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
became, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
distinct., 1
"There, 1
can, 1
be, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
about, 1
it,", 1
thought, 1
he;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
some, 1
prisoner, 1
who, 1
is, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
his, 1
freedom., 1
Oh,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
only, 1
there, 1
to, 1
help, 1
him!", 1
Suddenly, 1
another, 1
idea, 1
took, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
so, 1
used, 1
to, 1
misfortune,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
hope--the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
was, 1
made, 1
by, 1
workmen, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
had, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
repair, 1
the, 1
neighboring, 1
dungeon., 1
It, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
this;, 1
but, 1
how, 1
could, 1
he, 1
risk, 1
the, 1
question?, 1
It, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
call, 1
his, 1
jailer's, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1
noise,, 1
and, 1
watch, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
as, 1
he, 1
listened;, 1
but, 1
might, 1
he, 1
not, 1
by, 1
this, 1
means, 1
destroy, 1
hopes, 1
far, 1
more, 1
important, 1
than, 1
the, 1
short-lived, 1
satisfaction, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
curiosity?, 1
Unfortunately,, 1
Edmond's, 1
brain, 1
was, 1
still, 1
so, 1
feeble, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
bend, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
to, 1
anything, 1
in, 1
particular., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
but, 1
one, 1
means, 1
of, 1
restoring, 1
lucidity, 1
and, 1
clearness, 1
to, 1
his, 1
judgment., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
soup, 1
which, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
had, 1
brought,, 1
rose,, 1
staggered, 1
towards, 1
it,, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
off, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
with, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
indescribable, 1
pleasure., 1
He, 1
had, 1
often, 1
heard, 1
that, 1
shipwrecked, 1
persons, 1
had, 1
died, 1
through, 1
having, 1
eagerly, 1
devoured, 1
too, 1
much, 1
food., 1
Edmond, 1
replaced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
the, 1
bread, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
devour,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
couch--he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
die., 1
He, 1
soon, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
his, 1
ideas, 1
became, 1
again, 1
collected--he, 1
could, 1
think,, 1
and, 1
strengthen, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
by, 1
reasoning., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
put, 1
this, 1
to, 1
the, 1
test,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
compromising, 1
anybody., 1
If, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
workman,, 1
I, 1
need, 1
but, 1
knock, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
will, 1
cease, 1
to, 1
work,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
find, 1
out, 1
who, 1
is, 1
knocking,, 1
and, 1
why, 1
he, 1
does, 1
so;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
his, 1
occupation, 1
is, 1
sanctioned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
resume, 1
it., 1
If,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
prisoner,, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
I, 1
make, 1
will, 1
alarm, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
cease,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
begin, 1
again, 1
until, 1
he, 1
thinks, 1
every, 1
one, 1
is, 1
asleep.", 1
Edmond, 1
rose, 1
again,, 1
but, 1
this, 1
time, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
did, 1
not, 1
tremble,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
sight, 1
was, 1
clear;, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
detached, 1
a, 1
stone,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
it, 1
knocked, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
where, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
came., 1
He, 1
struck, 1
thrice., 1
At, 1
the, 1
first, 1
blow, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
ceased,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
by, 1
magic., 1
Edmond, 1
listened, 1
intently;, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
passed,, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
passed,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wall--all, 1
was, 1
silent, 1
there., 1
Full, 1
of, 1
hope,, 1
Edmond, 1
swallowed, 1
a, 1
few, 1
mouthfuls, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
water,, 1
and,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vigor, 1
of, 1
his, 1
constitution,, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
well-nigh, 1
recovered., 1
The, 1
day, 1
passed, 1
away, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
silence--night, 1
came, 1
without, 1
recurrence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
noise., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
prisoner,", 1
said, 1
Edmond, 1
joyfully., 1
The, 1
night, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
perfect, 1
silence., 1
Edmond, 1
did, 1
not, 1
close, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
In, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
fresh, 1
provisions--he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
devoured, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
day;, 1
he, 1
ate, 1
these, 1
listening, 1
anxiously, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sound,, 1
walking, 1
round, 1
and, 1
round, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
shaking, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
bars, 1
of, 1
the, 1
loophole,, 1
restoring, 1
vigor, 1
and, 1
agility, 1
to, 1
his, 1
limbs, 1
by, 1
exercise,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
preparing, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
his, 1
future, 1
destiny., 1
At, 1
intervals, 1
he, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
if, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
had, 1
not, 1
begun, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
grew, 1
impatient, 1
at, 1
the, 1
prudence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
who, 1
did, 1
not, 1
guess, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
captive, 1
as, 1
anxious, 1
for, 1
liberty, 1
as, 1
himself., 1
Three, 1
days, 1
passed--seventy-two, 1
long, 1
tedious, 1
hours, 1
which, 1
he, 1
counted, 1
off, 1
by, 1
minutes!, 1
At, 1
length, 1
one, 1
evening,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
was, 1
visiting, 1
him, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
time, 1
that, 1
night,, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
for, 1
the, 1
hundredth, 1
time, 1
at, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
imperceptible, 1
movement, 1
among, 1
the, 1
stones., 1
He, 1
moved, 1
away,, 1
walked, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
his, 1
cell, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
his, 1
thoughts,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
back, 1
and, 1
listened., 1
The, 1
matter, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
doubtful., 1
Something, 1
was, 1
at, 1
work, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
had, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
danger,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
substituted, 1
a, 1
lever, 1
for, 1
a, 1
chisel., 1
Encouraged, 1
by, 1
this, 1
discovery,, 1
Edmond, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
assist, 1
the, 1
indefatigable, 1
laborer., 1
He, 1
began, 1
by, 1
moving, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
anything, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
pierce, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
penetrate, 1
the, 1
moist, 1
cement,, 1
and, 1
displace, 1
a, 1
stone., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
nothing,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
knife, 1
or, 1
sharp, 1
instrument,, 1
the, 1
window, 1
grating, 1
was, 1
of, 1
iron,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
too, 1
often, 1
assured, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
its, 1
solidity., 1
All, 1
his, 1
furniture, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bed,, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
a, 1
pail,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
jug., 1
The, 1
bed, 1
had, 1
iron, 1
clamps,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
screwed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wood,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
required, 1
a, 1
screw-driver, 1
to, 1
take, 1
them, 1
off., 1
The, 1
table, 1
and, 1
chair, 1
had, 1
nothing,, 1
the, 1
pail, 1
had, 1
once, 1
possessed, 1
a, 1
handle,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
removed., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
but, 1
one, 1
resource,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
break, 1
the, 1
jug,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
fragments, 1
attack, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
He, 1
let, 1
the, 1
jug, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
broke, 1
in, 1
pieces., 1
Dantes, 1
concealed, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sharpest, 1
fragments, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
The, 1
breaking, 1
of, 1
his, 1
jug, 1
was, 1
too, 1
natural, 1
an, 1
accident, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
suspicion., 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
all, 1
the, 1
night, 1
to, 1
work, 1
in,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
do, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
working, 1
against, 1
something, 1
very, 1
hard;, 1
he, 1
pushed, 1
back, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
day., 1
All, 1
night, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
subterranean, 1
workman,, 1
who, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
mine, 1
his, 1
way., 1
Day, 1
came,, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
entered., 1
Dantes, 1
told, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
jug, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
drinking,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
went, 1
grumblingly, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
another,, 1
without, 1
giving, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
the, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
one., 1
He, 1
returned, 1
speedily,, 1
advised, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
to, 1
be, 1
more, 1
careful,, 1
and, 1
departed., 1
Dantes, 1
heard, 1
joyfully, 1
the, 1
key, 1
grate, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock;, 1
he, 1
listened, 1
until, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
steps, 1
died, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
hastily, 1
displacing, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
saw, 1
by, 1
the, 1
faint, 1
light, 1
that, 1
penetrated, 1
into, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
labored, 1
uselessly, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening, 1
in, 1
attacking, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
removing, 1
the, 1
plaster, 1
that, 1
surrounded, 1
it., 1
The, 1
damp, 1
had, 1
rendered, 1
it, 1
friable,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
able, 1
to, 1
break, 1
it, 1
off--in, 1
small, 1
morsels,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
he, 1
had, 1
scraped, 1
off, 1
a, 1
handful;, 1
a, 1
mathematician, 1
might, 1
have, 1
calculated, 1
that, 1
in, 1
two, 1
years,, 1
supposing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
was, 1
not, 1
encountered,, 1
a, 1
passage, 1
twenty, 1
feet, 1
long, 1
and, 1
two, 1
feet, 1
broad,, 1
might, 1
be, 1
formed., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
reproached, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
not, 1
having, 1
thus, 1
employed, 1
the, 1
hours, 1
he, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
hopes,, 1
prayer,, 1
and, 1
despondency., 1
During, 1
the, 1
six, 1
years, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
imprisoned,, 1
what, 1
might, 1
he, 1
not, 1
have, 1
accomplished?, 1
In, 1
three, 1
days, 1
he, 1
had, 1
succeeded,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
precaution,, 1
in, 1
removing, 1
the, 1
cement,, 1
and, 1
exposing, 1
the, 1
stone-work., 1
The, 1
wall, 1
was, 1
built, 1
of, 1
rough, 1
stones,, 1
among, 1
which,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
the, 1
structure,, 1
blocks, 1
of, 1
hewn, 1
stone, 1
were, 1
at, 1
intervals, 1
imbedded., 1
It, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
he, 1
had, 1
uncovered,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
must, 1
remove, 1
from, 1
its, 1
socket., 1
Dantes, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
do, 1
this, 1
with, 1
his, 1
nails,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
too, 1
weak., 1
The, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jug, 1
broke,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
useless, 1
toil,, 1
he, 1
paused., 1
Was, 1
he, 1
to, 1
be, 1
thus, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
he, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
inactive, 1
until, 1
his, 1
fellow, 1
workman, 1
had, 1
completed, 1
his, 1
task?, 1
Suddenly, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
him--he, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
dried, 1
on, 1
his, 1
forehead., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
always, 1
brought, 1
Dantes', 1
soup, 1
in, 1
an, 1
iron, 1
saucepan;, 1
this, 1
saucepan, 1
contained, 1
soup, 1
for, 1
both, 1
prisoners,, 1
for, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
either, 1
quite, 1
full,, 1
or, 1
half, 1
empty,, 1
according, 1
as, 1
the, 1
turnkey, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
to, 1
him, 1
or, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
first., 1
The, 1
handle, 1
of, 1
this, 1
saucepan, 1
was, 1
of, 1
iron;, 1
Dantes, 1
would, 1
have, 1
given, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
his, 1
life, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
for, 1
it., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
pour, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
the, 1
saucepan, 1
into, 1
Dantes', 1
plate,, 1
and, 1
Dantes,, 1
after, 1
eating, 1
his, 1
soup, 1
with, 1
a, 1
wooden, 1
spoon,, 1
washed, 1
the, 1
plate,, 1
which, 1
thus, 1
served, 1
for, 1
every, 1
day., 1
Now, 1
when, 1
evening, 1
came, 1
Dantes, 1
put, 1
his, 1
plate, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
near, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
entered,, 1
stepped, 1
on, 1
it, 1
and, 1
broke, 1
it., 1
This, 1
time, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
blame, 1
Dantes., 1
He, 1
was, 1
wrong, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
it, 1
there,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
was, 1
wrong, 1
not, 1
to, 1
have, 1
looked, 1
before, 1
him., 1
The, 1
jailer,, 1
therefore,, 1
only, 1
grumbled., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
about, 1
for, 1
something, 1
to, 1
pour, 1
the, 1
soup, 1
into;, 1
Dantes', 1
entire, 1
dinner, 1
service, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
one, 1
plate--there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
alternative., 1
"Leave, 1
the, 1
saucepan,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
take, 1
it, 1
away, 1
when, 1
you, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
my, 1
breakfast.", 1
This, 1
advice, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
jailer's, 1
taste,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
spared, 1
him, 1
the, 1
necessity, 1
of, 1
making, 1
another, 1
trip., 1
He, 1
left, 1
the, 1
saucepan., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
beside, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
He, 1
rapidly, 1
devoured, 1
his, 1
food,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
waiting, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
should, 1
change, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
and, 1
return,, 1
he, 1
removed, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
handle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
saucepan,, 1
inserted, 1
the, 1
point, 1
between, 1
the, 1
hewn, 1
stone, 1
and, 1
rough, 1
stones, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
employed, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
lever., 1
A, 1
slight, 1
oscillation, 1
showed, 1
Dantes, 1
that, 1
all, 1
went, 1
well., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
was, 1
extricated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
leaving, 1
a, 1
cavity, 1
a, 1
foot, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
in, 1
diameter., 1
Dantes, 1
carefully, 1
collected, 1
the, 1
plaster,, 1
carried, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
earth., 1
Then,, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
best, 1
use, 1
of, 1
his, 1
time, 1
while, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
labor,, 1
he, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
work, 1
without, 1
ceasing., 1
At, 1
the, 1
dawn, 1
of, 1
day, 1
he, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
pushed, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
lay, 1
down., 1
The, 1
breakfast, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
bread;, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
entered, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
bread, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"Well,, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
another, 1
plate?", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
turnkey;, 1
"you, 1
destroy, 1
everything., 1
First, 1
you, 1
break, 1
your, 1
jug,, 1
then, 1
you, 1
make, 1
me, 1
break, 1
your, 1
plate;, 1
if, 1
all, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
followed, 1
your, 1
example,, 1
the, 1
government, 1
would, 1
be, 1
ruined., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
the, 1
saucepan,, 1
and, 1
pour, 1
your, 1
soup, 1
into, 1
that., 1
So, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
destructive.", 1
Dantes, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
and, 1
clasped, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
coverlet., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
more, 1
gratitude, 1
for, 1
the, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
this, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
iron, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
felt, 1
for, 1
anything., 1
He, 1
had, 1
noticed,, 1
however,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
had, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
labor;, 1
no, 1
matter,, 1
this, 1
was, 1
a, 1
greater, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
proceeding--if, 1
his, 1
neighbor, 1
would, 1
not, 1
come, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
go, 1
to, 1
his, 1
neighbor., 1
All, 1
day, 1
he, 1
toiled, 1
on, 1
untiringly,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
extracting, 1
ten, 1
handfuls, 1
of, 1
plaster, 1
and, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
stone., 1
When, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
for, 1
his, 1
jailer's, 1
visit, 1
arrived,, 1
Dantes, 1
straightened, 1
the, 1
handle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
saucepan, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
its, 1
accustomed, 1
place., 1
The, 1
turnkey, 1
poured, 1
his, 1
ration, 1
of, 1
soup, 1
into, 1
it,, 1
together, 1
with, 1
the, 1
fish--for, 1
thrice, 1
a, 1
week, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
were, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
meat., 1
This, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
method, 1
of, 1
reckoning, 1
time,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
Dantes, 1
long, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
Having, 1
poured, 1
out, 1
the, 1
soup,, 1
the, 1
turnkey, 1
retired., 1
Dantes, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
whether, 1
his, 1
neighbor, 1
had, 1
really, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
work., 1
He, 1
listened--all, 1
was, 1
silent,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
days., 1
Dantes, 1
sighed;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
his, 1
neighbor, 1
distrusted, 1
him., 1
However,, 1
he, 1
toiled, 1
on, 1
all, 1
the, 1
night, 1
without, 1
being, 1
discouraged;, 1
but, 1
after, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
hours, 1
he, 1
encountered, 1
an, 1
obstacle., 1
The, 1
iron, 1
made, 1
no, 1
impression,, 1
but, 1
met, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smooth, 1
surface;, 1
Dantes, 1
touched, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
beam., 1
This, 1
beam, 1
crossed,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
blocked, 1
up,, 1
the, 1
hole, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
made;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
necessary,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
dig, 1
above, 1
or, 1
under, 1
it., 1
The, 1
unhappy, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
not, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
this., 1
"O, 1
my, 1
God,, 1
my, 1
God!", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
so, 1
earnestly, 1
prayed, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
hoped, 1
my, 1
prayers, 1
had, 1
been, 1
heard., 1
After, 1
having, 1
deprived, 1
me, 1
of, 1
my, 1
liberty,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
deprived, 1
me, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
recalled, 1
me, 1
to, 1
existence,, 1
my, 1
God,, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
me, 1
die, 1
in, 1
despair!", 1
"Who, 1
talks, 1
of, 1
God, 1
and, 1
despair, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time?", 1
said, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
come, 1
from, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
and,, 1
deadened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
distance,, 1
sounded, 1
hollow, 1
and, 1
sepulchral, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
ears., 1
Edmond's, 1
hair, 1
stood, 1
on, 1
end,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
his, 1
knees., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
hear, 1
a, 1
human, 1
voice.", 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
any, 1
one, 1
speak, 1
save, 1
his, 1
jailer, 1
for, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
years;, 1
and, 1
a, 1
jailer, 1
is, 1
no, 1
man, 1
to, 1
a, 1
prisoner--he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
living, 1
door,, 1
a, 1
barrier, 1
of, 1
flesh, 1
and, 1
blood, 1
adding, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
restraints, 1
of, 1
oak, 1
and, 1
iron., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
heaven,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
"speak, 1
again,, 1
though, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
your, 1
voice, 1
terrifies, 1
me., 1
Who, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
"Who, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
voice., 1
"An, 1
unhappy, 1
prisoner,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
made, 1
no, 1
hesitation, 1
in, 1
answering., 1
"Of, 1
what, 1
country?", 1
"A, 1
Frenchman.", 1
"Your, 1
name?", 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes.", 1
"Your, 1
profession?", 1
"A, 1
sailor.", 1
"How, 1
long, 1
have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
here?", 1
"Since, 1
the, 1
28th, 1
of, 1
February,, 1
1815.", 1
"Your, 1
crime?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
innocent.", 1
"But, 1
of, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
accused?", 1
"Of, 1
having, 1
conspired, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
the, 1
emperor's, 1
return.", 1
"What!, 1
For, 1
the, 1
emperor's, 1
return?--the, 1
emperor, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
on, 1
the, 1
throne,, 1
then?", 1
"He, 1
abdicated, 1
at, 1
Fontainebleau, 1
in, 1
1814,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba., 1
But, 1
how, 1
long, 1
have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
here, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
"Since, 1
1811.", 1
Dantes, 1
shuddered;, 1
this, 1
man, 1
had, 1
been, 1
four, 1
years, 1
longer, 1
than, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
prison., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
dig, 1
any, 1
more,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
voice;, 1
"only, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
how, 1
high, 1
up, 1
is, 1
your, 1
excavation?", 1
"On, 1
a, 1
level, 1
with, 1
the, 1
floor.", 1
"How, 1
is, 1
it, 1
concealed?", 1
"Behind, 1
my, 1
bed.", 1
"Has, 1
your, 1
bed, 1
been, 1
moved, 1
since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
prisoner?", 1
"No.", 1
"What, 1
does, 1
your, 1
chamber, 1
open, 1
on?", 1
"A, 1
corridor.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
corridor?", 1
"On, 1
a, 1
court.", 1
"Alas!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
voice., 1
"Oh,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
cried, 1
Dantes., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
mistake, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
an, 1
error, 1
in, 1
my, 1
plans., 1
I, 1
took, 1
the, 1
wrong, 1
angle,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
come, 1
out, 1
fifteen, 1
feet, 1
from, 1
where, 1
I, 1
intended., 1
I, 1
took, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
you, 1
are, 1
mining, 1
for, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
wall, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fortress.", 1
"But, 1
then, 1
you, 1
would, 1
be, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sea?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
hoped.", 1
"And, 1
supposing, 1
you, 1
had, 1
succeeded?", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
thrown, 1
myself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
gained, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
islands, 1
near, 1
here--the, 1
Isle, 1
de, 1
Daume, 1
or, 1
the, 1
Isle, 1
de, 1
Tiboulen--and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
safe.", 1
"Could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
swum, 1
so, 1
far?", 1
"Heaven, 1
would, 1
have, 1
given, 1
me, 1
strength;, 1
but, 1
now, 1
all, 1
is, 1
lost.", 1
"All?", 1
"Yes;, 1
stop, 1
up, 1
your, 1
excavation, 1
carefully,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
work, 1
any, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
wait, 1
until, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
from, 1
me.", 1
"Tell, 1
me,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
who, 1
you, 1
are?", 1
"I, 1
am--I, 1
am, 1
No., 1
27.", 1
"You, 1
mistrust, 1
me,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
Edmond, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
laugh, 1
resounding, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths., 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
Christian,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
guessing, 1
instinctively, 1
that, 1
this, 1
man, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
abandon, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you, 1
by, 1
him, 1
who, 1
died, 1
for, 1
us, 1
that, 1
naught, 1
shall, 1
induce, 1
me, 1
to, 1
breathe, 1
one, 1
syllable, 1
to, 1
my, 1
jailers;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
conjure, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
abandon, 1
me., 1
If, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
got, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
my, 1
strength,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
will, 1
dash, 1
my, 1
brains, 1
out, 1
against, 1

you, 1
will, 1
have, 1
my, 1
death, 1
to, 1
reproach, 1
yourself, 1
with.", 1
"How, 1
old, 1
are, 1
you?, 1
Your, 1
voice, 1
is, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man.", 1

do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
my, 1

I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
counted, 1
the, 1
years, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
here., 1
All, 1
I, 1
do, 1
know, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
just, 1
nineteen, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
arrested,, 1
the, 1
28th, 1
of, 1
February,, 1
1815.", 1
"Not, 1
quite, 1
twenty-six!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
voice;, 1
"at, 1
that, 1
age, 1
he, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
a, 1
traitor.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes., 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you, 1
again,, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
betray, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
allow, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
hacked, 1
in, 1
pieces!", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
done, 1
well, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
my, 1
assistance,, 1

about, 1
to, 1

age, 1

me., 1

you., 1
Wait.", 1
"How, 1
long?", 1
"I, 1
must, 1
calculate, 1
our, 1
chances;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
the, 1
signal.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
me;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
come, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
or, 1
you, 1
will, 1
let, 1
me, 1
come, 1
to, 1
you., 1
We, 1
will, 1
escape,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
we, 1
cannot, 1
escape, 1
we, 1
will, 1
talk;, 1
you, 1
of, 1
those, 1
whom, 1
you, 1

and, 1
I, 1
of, 1
those, 1

I, 1

You, 1
must, 1
love, 1
somebody?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
will, 1
love, 1
me., 1
If, 1
you, 1
are, 1
young,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
your, 1
comrade;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
old,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
your, 1
son., 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
father, 1
who, 1
is, 1
seventy, 1
if, 1
he, 1
yet, 1
lives;, 1
I, 1
only, 1
love, 1
him, 1
and, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
called, 1
Mercedes., 1
My, 1
father, 1
has, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
forgotten, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure,, 1
but, 1
God, 1
alone, 1
knows, 1
if, 1
she, 1
loves, 1
me, 1
still;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
love, 1
you, 1
as, 1
I, 1
loved, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
voice;, 1
"to-morrow.", 1
These, 1
few, 1
words, 1
were, 1
uttered, 1
with, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
that, 1
left, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sincerity;, 1
Dantes, 1
rose,, 1
dispersed, 1
the, 1
fragments, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
precaution, 1
as, 1
before,, 1
and, 1
pushed, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
back, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
He, 1
then, 1
gave, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
to, 1
his, 1
happiness., 1
He, 1
would, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
be, 1
alone., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
perhaps,, 1
about, 1
to, 1
regain, 1
his, 1
liberty;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
worst,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
a, 1
companion,, 1
and, 1
captivity, 1
that, 1
is, 1
shared, 1
is, 1
but, 1
half, 1
captivity., 1
Plaints, 1
made, 1
in, 1
common, 1
are, 1
almost, 1
prayers,, 1
and, 1
prayers, 1
where, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
are, 1
gathered, 1
together, 1
invoke, 1
the, 1
mercy, 1
of, 1
heaven., 1
All, 1
day, 1
Dantes, 1
walked, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
He, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
occasionally, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
pressing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
At, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
noise, 1
he, 1
bounded, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Once, 1
or, 1
twice, 1
the, 1
thought, 1
crossed, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
this, 1
unknown,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
loved, 1
already;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
made, 1
up--when, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
moved, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
stooped, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
kill, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
water, 1
jug., 1
He, 1
would, 1
be, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
die, 1
of, 1
grief, 1
and, 1
despair, 1
when, 1
this, 1
miraculous, 1
noise, 1
recalled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
life., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
came, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
thus, 1
he, 1
better, 1
guarded, 1
the, 1
unfinished, 1
opening., 1
Doubtless, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
expression, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
said,, 1
"Come,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
mad, 1
again?", 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer;, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
the, 1
emotion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
would, 1
betray, 1
him., 1
The, 1
jailer, 1
went, 1
away, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head., 1
Night, 1
came;, 1
Dantes, 1
hoped, 1
that, 1
his, 1
neighbor, 1
would, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
to, 1
address, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
mistaken., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning,, 1
however,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
removed, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
three, 1
knocks;, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
here.", 1
"Is, 1
your, 1
jailer, 1
gone?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
return, 1
until, 1
the, 1
evening;, 1
so, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
twelve, 1
hours, 1
before, 1
us.", 1
"I, 1
can, 1
work,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
voice., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes;, 1
this, 1
instant,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
you.", 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
on, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
resting, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
knelt, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
suddenly, 1
gave, 1
way;, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
smartly,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
stones, 1
and, 1
earth, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hole, 1
that, 1
opened, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
aperture, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
formed., 1
Then, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
this, 1
passage,, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
of, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
measure,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
appear,, 1
first, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
shoulders,, 1
and, 1
lastly, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
sprang, 1
lightly, 1
into, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
Chapter, 1
16., 1
A, 1
Learned, 1
Italian., 1
Seizing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
the, 1
friend, 1
so, 1
long, 1
and, 1
ardently, 1
desired,, 1
Dantes, 1
almost, 1
carried, 1
him, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
better, 1
view, 1
of, 1
his, 1
features, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
imperfect, 1
light, 1
that, 1
struggled, 1
through, 1
the, 1
grating., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
small, 1
stature,, 1
with, 1
hair, 1
blanched, 1
rather, 1
by, 1
suffering, 1
and, 1
sorrow, 1
than, 1
by, 1
age., 1
He, 1
had, 1
a, 1
deep-set,, 1
penetrating, 1
eye,, 1
almost, 1
buried, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
gray, 1
eyebrow,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
long, 1
(and, 1
still, 1
black), 1
beard, 1
reaching, 1
down, 1
to, 1
his, 1
breast., 1
His, 1
thin, 1
face,, 1
deeply, 1
furrowed, 1
by, 1
care,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
bold, 1
outline, 1
of, 1
his, 1
strongly, 1
marked, 1
features,, 1
betokened, 1
a, 1
man, 1
more, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
exercise, 1
his, 1
mental, 1
faculties, 1
than, 1
his, 1
physical, 1
strength., 1
Large, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
perspiration, 1
were, 1
now, 1
standing, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
garments, 1
that, 1
hung, 1
about, 1
him, 1
were, 1
so, 1
ragged, 1
that, 1
one, 1
could, 1
only, 1
guess, 1
at, 1
the, 1
pattern, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
originally, 1
been, 1
fashioned., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
might, 1
have, 1
numbered, 1
sixty, 1
or, 1
sixty-five, 1
years;, 1
but, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
briskness, 1
and, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
vigor, 1
in, 1
his, 1
movements, 1
made, 1
it, 1
probable, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
aged, 1
more, 1
from, 1
captivity, 1
than, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
time., 1
He, 1
received, 1
the, 1
enthusiastic, 1
greeting, 1
of, 1
his, 1
young, 1
acquaintance, 1
with, 1
evident, 1
pleasure,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
his, 1
chilled, 1
affections, 1
were, 1
rekindled, 1
and, 1
invigorated, 1
by, 1
his, 1
contact, 1
with, 1
one, 1
so, 1
warm, 1
and, 1
ardent., 1
He, 1
thanked, 1
him, 1
with, 1
grateful, 1
cordiality, 1
for, 1
his, 1
kindly, 1
welcome,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
must, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
have, 1
been, 1
suffering, 1
bitterly, 1
to, 1
find, 1
another, 1
dungeon, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
fondly, 1
reckoned, 1
on, 1
discovering, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
regaining, 1
his, 1
liberty., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
first, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"whether, 1
it, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
the, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
my, 1
entrance, 1
here--our, 1
future, 1
tranquillity, 1
depends, 1
upon, 1
our, 1
jailers, 1
being, 1
entirely, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
Advancing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
he, 1
stooped, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
easily, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
its, 1
weight;, 1
then,, 1
fitting, 1
it, 1
into, 1
its, 1
place,, 1
he, 1
said,--, 1
"You, 1
removed, 1
this, 1
stone, 1
very, 1
carelessly;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
you, 1
had, 1
no, 1
tools, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
you.", 1
"Why,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
astonishment,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
possess, 1
any?", 1
"I, 1
made, 1
myself, 1
some;, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
a, 1
file,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
all, 1
that, 1
are, 1
necessary,--a, 1
chisel,, 1
pincers,, 1
and, 1
lever.", 1
"Oh,, 1
how, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
see, 1
these, 1
products, 1
of, 1
your, 1
industry, 1
and, 1
patience.", 1
"Well,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
chisel.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
he, 1
displayed, 1
a, 1
sharp, 1
strong, 1
blade,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
handle, 1
made, 1
of, 1
beechwood., 1
"And, 1
with, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
contrive, 1
to, 1
make, 1
that?", 1
inquired, 1
Dantes., 1
"With, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clamps, 1
of, 1
my, 1
bedstead;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
very, 1
tool, 1
has, 1
sufficed, 1
me, 1
to, 1
hollow, 1
out, 1
the, 1
road, 1
by, 1
which, 1
I, 1
came, 1
hither,, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1

"Fifty, 1
feet!", 1
responded, 1
Dantes,, 1
almost, 1
terrified., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
so, 1
loud,, 1
young, 1
man--don't, 1
speak, 1
so, 1
loud., 1

frequently, 1
occurs, 1
in, 1
a, 1
state, 1
prison, 1

this,, 1
that, 1
persons, 1

stationed, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
the, 1

the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
prisoners.", 1
"But, 1
they, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
am, 1
shut, 1
up, 1
alone, 1
here.", 1
"That, 1
makes, 1
no, 1
difference.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
dug, 1
your, 1
way, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
fifty, 1
feet, 1

get, 1
here?", 1
"I, 1

about, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
that, 1
separates, 1
your, 1
chamber, 1
from, 1
mine;, 1
only,, 1
unfortunately,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
curve, 1
aright;, 1

want, 1
of, 1
the, 1
necessary, 1
geometrical, 1
instruments, 1
to, 1
calculate, 1
my, 1
scale, 1
of, 1
proportion,, 1

of, 1
taking, 1
an, 1
ellipsis, 1
of, 1

made, 1
it, 1
fifty., 1

throw, 1
myself, 1
into, 1

have,, 1
however,, 1
kept, 1
along, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
on, 1

opens,, 1

of, 1
going, 1
beneath, 1

labor, 1
is, 1
all, 1
in, 1
vain,, 1

I, 1
find, 1
that, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
looks, 1
into, 1
a, 1
courtyard, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
soldiers.", 1
"That's, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1

the, 1
corridor, 1

built, 1
against, 1

it, 1
face?", 1
The, 1
wall, 1
of, 1

he, 1
spoke, 1

the, 1

in, 1
which, 1
was, 1
fixed, 1
the, 1
loophole, 1
by, 1
which, 1
light, 1
was, 1
admitted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chamber., 1
This, 1
loophole,, 1
which, 1
gradually, 1
diminished, 1
in, 1
size, 1
as, 1
it, 1
approached, 1

an, 1

a, 1
child, 1
could, 1

for, 1
better, 1
security,, 1
furnished, 1
with, 1
three, 1
iron, 1
bars,, 1

as, 1
to, 1
quiet, 1
all, 1
apprehensions, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1

suspicious, 1
jailer, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
possibility, 1
of, 1

prisoner's, 1
escape., 1
As, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
asked, 1
the, 1
question,, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
the, 1
table, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
window., 1
"Climb, 1
up,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
obeyed,, 1
mounted, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and,, 1
divining, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
back, 1
securely, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
and, 1
held, 1
out, 1
both, 1
hands., 1
The, 1
stranger,, 1
whom, 1
as, 1
yet, 1
Dantes, 1
knew, 1
only, 1
by, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
sprang, 1
up, 1
with, 1
an, 1
agility, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
to, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
in, 1
a, 1
person, 1
of, 1
his, 1
years,, 1
and,, 1
light, 1
and, 1
steady, 1
on, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
as, 1
a, 1
cat, 1
or, 1
a, 1
lizard,, 1
climbed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
table, 1
to, 1
the, 1
outstretched, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
them, 1
to, 1
his, 1
shoulders;, 1
then,, 1
bending, 1
double,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
ceiling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dungeon, 1
prevented, 1
him, 1
from, 1
holding, 1
himself, 1
erect,, 1
he, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
slip, 1
his, 1
head, 1
between, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
bars, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
command, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
view, 1
from, 1
top, 1
to, 1
bottom., 1
An, 1
instant, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
hastily, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
saying,, 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
so!", 1
and, 1
sliding, 1
from, 1
the, 1
shoulders, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
as, 1
dextrously, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ascended,, 1
he, 1
nimbly, 1
leaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
table, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
"What, 1
was, 1
it, 1
that, 1
you, 1
thought?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
anxiously,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
descending, 1
from, 1
the, 1
table., 1
The, 1
elder, 1
prisoner, 1
pondered, 1
the, 1
matter., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
so., 1
This, 1
side, 1
of, 1
your, 1
chamber, 1
looks, 1
out, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
open, 1
gallery,, 1
where, 1
patrols, 1
are, 1
continually, 1
passing,, 1
and, 1
sentries, 1
keep, 1
watch, 1
day, 1
and, 1
night.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
that?", 1
"Certain., 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
soldier's, 1
shape, 1
and, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
his, 1
musket;, 1
that, 1
made, 1
me, 1
draw, 1
in, 1
my, 1
head, 1
so, 1
quickly,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
was, 1
fearful, 1
he, 1
might, 1
also, 1
see, 1
me.", 1
"Well?", 1
inquired, 1
Dantes., 1
"You, 1
perceive, 1
then, 1
the, 1
utter, 1
impossibility, 1
of, 1
escaping, 1
through, 1
your, 1
dungeon?", 1
"Then,", 1
pursued, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
eagerly--, 1
"Then,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
prisoner,, 1
"the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
God, 1
be, 1
done!", 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
slowly, 1
pronounced, 1
those, 1
words,, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
resignation, 1
spread, 1
itself, 1
over, 1
his, 1
careworn, 1
countenance., 1
Dantes, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
could, 1
thus, 1
philosophically, 1
resign, 1
hopes, 1
so, 1
long, 1
and, 1
ardently, 1
nourished, 1
with, 1
an, 1
astonishment, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
admiration., 1
"Tell, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
and, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are?", 1
said, 1
he, 1
at, 1
length;, 1
"never, 1
have, 1
I, 1
met, 1
with, 1
so, 1
remarkable, 1
a, 1
person, 1
as, 1
yourself.", 1
"Willingly,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
stranger;, 1
"if,, 1
indeed,, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
any, 1
curiosity, 1
respecting, 1
one,, 1
now,, 1
alas,, 1
powerless, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
you, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way.", 1
"Say, 1
not, 1
so;, 1
you, 1
can, 1
console, 1
and, 1
support, 1
me, 1
by, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
your, 1
own, 1
powerful, 1
mind., 1
Pray, 1
let, 1
me, 1
know, 1
who, 1
you, 1
really, 1
are?", 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
smiled, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
smile., 1
"Then, 1
listen,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
been, 1
imprisoned, 1
as, 1
you, 1
know, 1
in, 1
this, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
since, 1
the, 1
year, 1
1811;, 1
previously, 1
to, 1

I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
confined, 1
for, 1
three, 1
years, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fortress, 1
of, 1
Fenestrelle., 1
In, 1
the, 1
year, 1
1811, 1
I, 1
was, 1
transferred, 1
to, 1
Piedmont, 1
in, 1
France., 1
It, 1
was, 1
at, 1
this, 1
period, 1

learned, 1
that, 1
the, 1
destiny, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
subservient, 1
to, 1
every, 1
wish, 1
formed, 1

king, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1

in, 1

was, 1
very, 1
far, 1

from, 1
expecting, 1
the, 1
change, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
informed, 1
me, 1
of;, 1

that, 1
four, 1
years, 1
afterwards,, 1
this, 1
colossus, 1
of, 1
power, 1
would, 1
be, 1
overthrown., 1
Then, 1
who, 1
reigns, 1
in, 1
France, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment--Napoleon, 1
II.?", 1
"No,, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII.", 1
"The, 1
brother, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1
XVII.!, 1
How, 1
inscrutable, 1
are, 1
the, 1
ways, 1

up, 1

abased?", 1
Dantes', 1
whole, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
riveted, 1
on, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
could, 1
thus, 1
forget, 1
his, 1
own, 1
misfortunes, 1

occupying, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
the, 1

said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1

and, 1
surveying, 1
him, 1
with, 1
the, 1
kindling, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prophet,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1

"Probably,, 1
if, 1
ever, 1
I, 1
get, 1
out, 1
of, 1
prison!", 1
"True,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
prisoners;, 1

I, 1
forget, 1
this, 1
sometimes,, 1

there, 1
are, 1
even, 1
moments, 1
when, 1
my, 1
mental, 1
vision, 1
transports, 1
me, 1
beyond, 1

I, 1
fancy, 1

at, 1
liberty.", 1
"But, 1
wherefore, 1
are, 1
you, 1
here?", 1
"Because, 1
in, 1
1807, 1
I, 1
dreamed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
very, 1
plan, 1
Napoleon, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
realize, 1
in, 1
1811;, 1
because,, 1
like, 1
Machiavelli,, 1
I, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
alter, 1
the, 1
political, 1
face, 1
of, 1
Italy,, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1

it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
split, 1
up, 1
into, 1
a, 1
quantity, 1

petty, 1
principalities,, 1

by, 1

sought, 1
to, 1
form, 1
one, 1
large,, 1
compact,, 1

powerful, 1
empire;, 1

lastly,, 1

had, 1
found, 1
my, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1

a, 1
crowned, 1
simpleton,, 1
who, 1
feigned, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
into, 1
my, 1
views, 1
only, 1
to, 1
betray, 1
me., 1

was, 1
the, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
Alexander, 1
VI., 1

Clement, 1
VII.,, 1

it, 1
will, 1
never, 1
succeed, 1
now,, 1

they, 1
attempted, 1
it, 1
fruitlessly,, 1

Napoleon, 1
was, 1
unable, 1

to, 1
misfortune.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
bowed, 1
his, 1
head., 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
a, 1
man, 1
risking, 1
his, 1
life, 1
for, 1
such, 1
matters., 1
Napoleon, 1
certainly, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
something, 1
of,, 1

he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1

spoken, 1
with, 1
him;, 1

of, 1
Clement, 1
VII., 1

Alexander, 1
VI., 1

knew, 1
nothing., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not,", 1
he, 1
asked,, 1
"the, 1
priest, 1

you?", 1
"I, 1

such, 1
innocent, 1
beings, 1
could, 1
be, 1
found, 1
in, 1
an, 1
abode, 1
devoted, 1
like, 1
this, 1
to, 1
suffering, 1
and, 1
despair.", 1
Dantes, 1
remained, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
motionless;, 1
at, 1
length, 1
he, 1
said,--"Then, 1
you, 1
abandon, 1
all, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
escape?", 1
"I, 1
perceive, 1
its, 1
utter, 1
impossibility;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
it, 1
impious, 1
to, 1
attempt, 1
that, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Almighty, 1
evidently, 1
does, 1
not, 1
approve.", 1
"Nay,, 1
be, 1
not, 1
discouraged., 1
Would, 1
it, 1
not, 1
be, 1
expecting, 1
too, 1
much, 1
to, 1
hope, 1
to, 1
succeed, 1
at, 1
your, 1
first, 1
attempt?, 1
Why, 1
not, 1
try, 1
to, 1
find, 1
an, 1
opening, 1
in, 1
another, 1
direction, 1
from, 1
that, 1
which, 1
has, 1
so, 1
unfortunately, 1
failed?", 1
"Alas,, 1
it, 1
shows, 1
how, 1
little, 1
notion, 1
you, 1
can, 1
have, 1
of, 1
all, 1
it, 1
has, 1
cost, 1
me, 1
to, 1
effect, 1
a, 1
purpose, 1
so, 1
unexpectedly, 1
frustrated,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
beginning, 1
over, 1
again., 1
In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
four, 1
years, 1
making, 1
the, 1
tools, 1
I, 1
possess,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
been, 1
two, 1
years, 1
scraping, 1
and, 1
digging, 1
out, 1
earth,, 1
hard, 1
as, 1
granite, 1
itself;, 1
then, 1
what, 1
toil, 1
and, 1
fatigue, 1
has, 1
it, 1
not, 1
been, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
huge, 1
stones, 1
I, 1
should, 1
once, 1
have, 1
deemed, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
loosen., 1
Whole, 1
days, 1
have, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
these, 1
Titanic, 1
efforts,, 1
considering, 1
my, 1
labor, 1
well, 1
repaid, 1
if,, 1
by, 1
night-time, 1
I, 1
had, 1
contrived, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
away, 1
a, 1
square, 1
inch, 1
of, 1
this, 1
hard-bound, 1
cement,, 1
changed, 1
by, 1
ages, 1
into, 1
a, 1
substance, 1
unyielding, 1
as, 1
the, 1
stones, 1
themselves;, 1
then, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
earth, 1
and, 1
rubbish, 1
I, 1
dug, 1
up,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
break, 1
through, 1
a, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
throw, 1
the, 1
fruits, 1
of, 1
my, 1
labor, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hollow, 1
part, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
well, 1
is, 1
now, 1
so, 1
completely, 1
choked, 1
up,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
scarcely, 1
think, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
add, 1
another, 1
handful, 1
of, 1
dust, 1
without, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
discovery., 1
Consider, 1
also, 1
that, 1
I, 1
fully, 1
believed, 1
I, 1
had, 1
accomplished, 1
the, 1
end, 1
and, 1
aim, 1
of, 1
my, 1
undertaking,, 1
for, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
so, 1
exactly, 1
husbanded, 1

strength, 1

to, 1
make, 1
it, 1
just, 1

out, 1

at, 1

Almighty's, 1
pleasure.", 1
Dantes, 1
held, 1
down, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
other, 1
might, 1
not, 1
see, 1
how, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
the, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
having, 1
a, 1
companion, 1
outweighed, 1
the, 1
sympathy, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
for, 1
the, 1
failure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
plans., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
sank, 1
upon, 1
Edmond's, 1
bed,, 1

Edmond, 1
himself, 1
remained, 1
standing., 1
Escape, 1
had, 1
never, 1
once, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
him., 1
There, 1
are,, 1
indeed,, 1
some, 1
things, 1
which, 1
appear, 1
so, 1
impossible, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
does, 1
not, 1
dwell, 1
on, 1
them, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant., 1

ground, 1
for, 1
fifty, 1
feet--to, 1
devote, 1
three, 1
years, 1
to, 1
a, 1
labor, 1

if, 1
successful,, 1
would, 1
conduct, 1
you, 1
to, 1
a, 1
precipice, 1
overhanging, 1

sea--to, 1
plunge, 1
into, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
from, 1
the, 1
height, 1
of, 1
fifty,, 1
sixty,, 1
perhaps, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
feet,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1
dashed, 1
to, 1
pieces, 1
against, 1
the, 1
rocks,, 1

you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
fortunate, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
have, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sentinels;, 1
and, 1
even,, 1
supposing, 1
all, 1
these, 1
perils, 1
past,, 1
then, 1
to, 1
have, 1
to, 1
swim, 1
for, 1
your, 1
life, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
at, 1
least, 1
three, 1
miles, 1
ere, 1
you, 1
could, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
shore--were, 1
difficulties, 1
so, 1
startling, 1

formidable, 1

Dantes, 1

never, 1
even, 1
dreamed, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
scheme,, 1
resigning, 1
himself, 1
rather, 1
to, 1
death., 1
But, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
man, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
life, 1
with, 1
so, 1
desperate, 1
a, 1
courage,, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ideas,, 1
and, 1
inspired, 1
him, 1
with, 1
new, 1
courage., 1
Another,, 1
older, 1
and, 1
less, 1
strong, 1
than, 1
he,, 1
had, 1
attempted, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
had, 1
sufficient, 1
resolution, 1
to, 1
undertake,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
only, 1
because, 1
of, 1
an, 1
error, 1
in, 1
calculation., 1
This, 1
same, 1
person,, 1
with, 1
almost, 1
incredible, 1
patience, 1
and, 1
perseverance,, 1
had, 1
contrived, 1
to, 1
provide, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
tools, 1
requisite, 1
for, 1
so, 1
unparalleled, 1
an, 1
attempt., 1
Another, 1
had, 1
done, 1
all, 1
this;, 1
why,, 1
then,, 1
was, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
Dantes?, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
dug, 1
his, 1
way, 1
through, 1
fifty, 1
feet,, 1
Dantes, 1
would, 1
dig, 1
a, 1
hundred;, 1
Faria,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
age, 1
of, 1
fifty,, 1
had, 1
devoted, 1
three, 1
years, 1
to, 1
the, 1
task;, 1
he,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
but, 1
half, 1
as, 1
old,, 1
would, 1
sacrifice, 1
six;, 1
Faria,, 1
a, 1
priest, 1
and, 1
savant,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
shrunk, 1
from, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
risking, 1
his, 1
life, 1
by, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
swim, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
three, 1
miles, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
islands--Daume,, 1
Rattonneau,, 1
or, 1
Lemaire;, 1
should, 1
a, 1
hardy, 1
sailer,, 1
an, 1
experienced, 1
diver,, 1
like, 1
himself,, 1
shrink, 1
from, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
task;, 1
should, 1
he,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
for, 1
mere, 1
amusement's, 1
sake, 1
plunged, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
up, 1
the, 1
bright, 1
coral, 1
branch,, 1
hesitate, 1
to, 1
entertain, 1
the, 1
same, 1
project?, 1
He, 1
could, 1
do, 1
it, 1
in, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
how, 1
many, 1
times, 1
had, 1
he,, 1
for, 1
pure, 1
pastime,, 1
continued, 1
in, 1
the, 1
water, 1
for, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twice, 1
as, 1
long!, 1
At, 1
once, 1
Dantes, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
the, 1
brave, 1
example, 1
of, 1
his, 1
energetic, 1
companion,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
what, 1
has, 1
once, 1
been, 1
done, 1
may, 1
be, 1
done, 1
again., 1
After, 1
continuing, 1
some, 1
time, 1
in, 1
profound, 1
meditation,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
suddenly, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
found, 1
what, 1
you, 1
were, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of!", 1
Faria, 1
started:, 1
"Have, 1
you,, 1
indeed?", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
quick, 1
anxiety;, 1
"pray,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
know, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discovered?", 1
"The, 1
corridor, 1
through, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
bored, 1
your, 1
way, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cell, 1
you, 1
occupy, 1
here,, 1

in, 1
the, 1

direction, 1

it, 1
not?", 1
"It, 1
does.", 1
"And, 1
is, 1
not, 1
above, 1
fifteen, 1
feet, 1
from, 1
it?", 1
"About, 1
that.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what, 1
we, 1
must, 1
do., 1
We, 1
must, 1
pierce, 1
through, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
by, 1
forming, 1
a, 1
side, 1
opening, 1
about, 1
the, 1
middle,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
were, 1
the, 1
top, 1
part, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cross., 1
This, 1
time, 1
you, 1
will, 1
lay, 1
your, 1
plans, 1
more, 1
accurately;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
get, 1
out, 1
into, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
you, 1
have, 1
described;, 1
kill, 1
the, 1
sentinel, 1
who, 1
guards, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
make, 1
our, 1
escape., 1
All, 1
we, 1
require, 1
to, 1
insure, 1
success, 1
is, 1
courage,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
possess,, 1
and, 1
strength,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
deficient, 1
in;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
patience,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
abundantly, 1
proved, 1
yours--you, 1
shall, 1
now, 1
see, 1
me, 1
prove, 1
mine.", 1
"One, 1
instant,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
clear, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
endowed,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
use, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
making, 1
of, 1
my, 1
strength., 1
As, 1
for, 1
patience,, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
abundantly, 1
exercised, 1
that, 1
in, 1
beginning, 1
every, 1
morning, 1
the, 1
task, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night, 1
before,, 1

every, 1
night, 1
renewing, 1
the, 1
task, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day., 1
But, 1
then,, 1
young, 1
man, 1
(and, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
of, 1
you, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
your, 1
full, 1
attention),, 1
then, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
doing, 1
anything, 1
displeasing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Almighty, 1
in, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
set, 1
an, 1
innocent, 1
being, 1
at, 1
liberty--one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
committed, 1
no, 1
offence,, 1
and, 1
merited, 1
not, 1
condemnation.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
your, 1
notions, 1
changed?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes, 1
with, 1
much, 1
surprise;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
yourself, 1
more, 1
guilty, 1
in, 1

you, 1
have, 1
encountered, 1
me?", 1
"No;, 1
neither, 1
do, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
incur, 1
guilt., 1
Hitherto, 1
I, 1
have, 1
fancied, 1
myself, 1
merely, 1
waging, 1
war, 1
against, 1
circumstances,, 1
not, 1
men., 1
I, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
no, 1
sin, 1
to, 1
bore, 1
through, 1
a, 1
wall,, 1
or, 1
destroy, 1
a, 1
staircase;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
so, 1
easily, 1
persuade, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
pierce, 1
a, 1
heart, 1
or, 1
take, 1
away, 1
a, 1
life.", 1
A, 1
slight, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
surprise, 1
escaped, 1
Dantes., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
where, 1
your, 1
liberty, 1
is, 1
at, 1
stake, 1
you, 1
can, 1
allow, 1
any, 1
such, 1
scruple, 1
to, 1
deter, 1
you, 1
from, 1
obtaining, 1
it?", 1
"Tell, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
"what, 1
has, 1
hindered, 1
you, 1
from, 1
knocking, 1
down, 1
your, 1
jailer, 1
with, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
wood, 1
torn, 1
from, 1
your, 1
bedstead,, 1
dressing, 1
yourself, 1
in, 1

endeavoring, 1
to, 1

"Simply, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
never, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
answered, 1
Dantes., 1
"Because,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"the, 1
natural, 1
repugnance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
commission, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
crime, 1
prevented, 1
you, 1
from, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
it, 1
ever, 1
is, 1
because, 1
in, 1
simple, 1
and, 1
allowable, 1
things, 1
our, 1
natural, 1
instincts, 1
keep, 1
us, 1
from, 1
deviating, 1
from, 1
the, 1
strict, 1
line, 1
of, 1
duty., 1
The, 1
tiger,, 1
whose, 1
nature, 1
teaches, 1
him, 1
to, 1
delight, 1
in, 1
shedding, 1
blood,, 1
needs, 1

the, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
smell, 1
to, 1
show, 1
him, 1
when, 1
his, 1
prey, 1
is, 1
within, 1
his, 1
reach,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
following, 1
this, 1
instinct, 1
he, 1
is, 1
enabled, 1
to, 1
measure, 1
the, 1
leap, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
permit, 1
him, 1
to, 1
spring, 1
on, 1
his, 1
victim;, 1
but, 1
man,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
loathes, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
blood--it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
alone, 1
that, 1
the, 1
laws, 1
of, 1
social, 1
life, 1
inspire, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
shrinking, 1
dread, 1
of, 1
taking, 1
life;, 1
his, 1
natural, 1
construction, 1
and, 1
physiological, 1
formation"--, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
confused, 1
and, 1
silent, 1
at, 1
this, 1
explanation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thoughts, 1
which, 1
had, 1
unconsciously, 1
been, 1
working, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
soul;, 1
for, 1
there, 1
are, 1
two, 1
distinct, 1
sorts, 1
of, 1
ideas,, 1
those, 1
that, 1
proceed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
head, 1
and, 1
those, 1
that, 1
emanate, 1
from, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
"Since, 1
my, 1
imprisonment,", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
over, 1
all, 1
the, 1
most, 1
celebrated, 1
cases, 1
of, 1
escape, 1
on, 1
record., 1
They, 1
have, 1
rarely, 1
been, 1
successful., 1
Those, 1
that, 1
have, 1
been, 1
crowned, 1
with, 1
full, 1
success, 1
have, 1
been, 1
long, 1
meditated, 1
upon,, 1
and, 1
carefully, 1
arranged;, 1
such,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
escape, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Duc, 1
de, 1
Beaufort, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
de, 1
Vincennes,, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Dubuquoi, 1
from, 1
For, 1
l'Eveque;, 1
of, 1
Latude, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Bastille., 1
Then, 1
there, 1
are, 1
those, 1
for, 1
which, 1
chance, 1
sometimes, 1
affords, 1
opportunity,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
are, 1
the, 1
best, 1
of, 1
all., 1
Let, 1
us,, 1
therefore,, 1
wait, 1
patiently, 1
for, 1
some, 1
favorable, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
it, 1
presents, 1
itself,, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
it.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"you, 1
might, 1
well, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
tedious, 1
delay;, 1
you, 1
were, 1
constantly, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
task, 1
you, 1
set, 1
yourself,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
weary, 1
with, 1
toil,, 1
you, 1
had, 1
your, 1
hopes, 1
to, 1
refresh, 1
and, 1
encourage, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
assure, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
that, 1
source, 1
for, 1
recreation, 1
or, 1
support.", 1
"What, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
then?", 1
"I, 1
wrote, 1
or, 1
studied.", 1
"Were, 1
you, 1
then, 1
permitted, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
pens,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
none, 1
but, 1
what, 1
I, 1
made, 1
for, 1
myself.", 1
"You, 1
made, 1
paper,, 1
pens, 1
and, 1
ink?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Dantes, 1
gazed, 1
with, 1
admiration,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
some, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
believing., 1
Faria, 1
saw, 1
this., 1
"When, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
me, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
in, 1
my, 1
cell,, 1
my, 1
young, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
show, 1
you, 1
an, 1
entire, 1
work,, 1
the, 1
fruits, 1
of, 1

thoughts, 1
and, 1
reflections, 1
of, 1
my, 1
whole, 1

many, 1

"And, 1
on, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
written, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
"On, 1
two, 1
of, 1
my, 1

invented, 1
a, 1

for, 1

after, 1

"You, 1
are,, 1

acquainted, 1
with, 1
a, 1
variety, 1
of, 1

have, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1

"Yes,, 1

"Improve, 1
yourself!", 1
repeated, 1
Dantes;, 1
"why,, 1
how, 1
can, 1
you, 1
manage, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so?", 1
"Why,, 1
I, 1
made, 1
a, 1
vocabulary, 1
of, 1
the, 1
words, 1

me, 1
to, 1
express, 1
my, 1

should, 1

should, 1

Stronger, 1
grew, 1
the, 1
wonder, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
almost, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
one, 1
gifted, 1
with, 1
supernatural, 1
powers;, 1
still, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
find, 1
some, 1
imperfection, 1
which, 1
might, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
down, 1
to, 1
a, 1
level, 1
with, 1
human, 1
beings,, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"Then, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
not, 1
furnished, 1

manage, 1
to, 1
write, 1
the, 1
work, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
of?", 1
"I, 1
made, 1
myself, 1
some, 1
excellent, 1
ones,, 1

would, 1

I, 1
selected, 1
the, 1
cartilages, 1
of, 1

heads, 1
of, 1
these, 1
fishes,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
imagine, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
welcomed, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
each, 1
Wednesday,, 1
Friday,, 1

Saturday,, 1

affording, 1
me, 1

means, 1
of, 1
increasing, 1
my, 1
stock, 1
of, 1
pens;, 1
for, 1

will, 1
freely, 1
confess, 1
that, 1
my, 1
historical, 1
labors, 1
have, 1
been, 1
my, 1
greatest, 1
solace, 1
and, 1
relief., 1

retracing, 1

at, 1
will, 1

cease, 1
to, 1
remember, 1

am, 1
myself, 1
a, 1
prisoner.", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
ink,", 1
said, 1
Dantes;, 1
"of, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
make, 1
your, 1
ink?", 1
"There, 1
was, 1
formerly, 1
a, 1
fireplace, 1
in, 1
my, 1
dungeon,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
"but, 1
it, 1

closed, 1
up, 1
long, 1

Still,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
many, 1

thickly, 1
covered, 1

I, 1
assure, 1

very, 1
important, 1
notes,, 1
for, 1

closer, 1
attention, 1
is, 1
required,, 1
I, 1
pricked, 1

the, 1

"Oh,, 1

directly!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Follow, 1
me,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
re-entered, 1
the, 1
subterranean, 1
passage,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
disappeared,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Dantes., 1
Chapter, 1
17., 1
The, 1
Abbe's, 1
Chamber., 1
After, 1
having, 1
passed, 1
with, 1
tolerable, 1
ease, 1
through, 1
the, 1
subterranean, 1
passage,, 1
which,, 1
however,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
admit, 1
of, 1
their, 1
holding, 1
themselves, 1
erect,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
further, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
into, 1
which, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
cell, 1
opened;, 1
from, 1
that, 1
point, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
became, 1
much, 1
narrower,, 1
and, 1
barely, 1
permitted, 1
one, 1
to, 1
creep, 1
through, 1
on, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
knees., 1
The, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
cell, 1
was, 1
paved,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
by, 1
raising, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stones, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
obscure, 1
corner, 1
that, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
to, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
commence, 1
the, 1
laborious, 1
task, 1
of, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
witnessed, 1
the, 1
completion., 1
As, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
Dantes, 1
cast, 1
around, 1
one, 1
eager, 1
and, 1
searching, 1
glance, 1
in, 1
quest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
expected, 1
marvels,, 1
but, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
common, 1
met, 1
his, 1
view., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
some, 1
hours, 1
before, 1
us--it, 1
is, 1
now, 1
just, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
past, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock.", 1
Instinctively, 1
Dantes, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
by, 1
what, 1
watch, 1
or, 1
clock, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
so, 1
accurately, 1
to, 1
specify, 1
the, 1
hour., 1
"Look, 1
at, 1
this, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
which, 1
enters, 1
by, 1
my, 1
window,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"and, 1
then, 1
observe, 1
the, 1
lines, 1
traced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
Well,, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
these, 1
lines,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
in, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
double, 1
motion, 1
of, 1

and, 1
the, 1
ellipse, 1
it, 1
describes, 1
round, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1

am, 1
enabled, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
the, 1
precise, 1
hour, 1
with, 1
more, 1
minuteness, 1
than, 1
if, 1
I, 1
possessed, 1
a, 1
watch;, 1
for, 1
that, 1
might, 1
be, 1
broken, 1

deranged, 1
in, 1
its, 1
movements,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
and, 1
earth, 1
never, 1
vary, 1
in, 1
their, 1
appointed, 1
paths.", 1
This, 1
last, 1
explanation, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
lost, 1
upon, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
always, 1
imagined,, 1
from, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
rise, 1
from, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
mountains, 1
and, 1
set, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
moved,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
the, 1
earth., 1
A, 1
double, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
globe, 1
he, 1
inhabited,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
feel, 1
nothing,, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
him, 1
perfectly, 1
impossible., 1
Each, 1
word, 1
that, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
companion's, 1
lips, 1
seemed, 1
fraught, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mysteries, 1
of, 1
science,, 1
as, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
digging, 1
out, 1
as, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
diamonds, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mines, 1
of, 1
Guzerat, 1
and, 1
Golconda,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
just, 1
recollect, 1
having, 1
visited, 1
during, 1
a, 1
voyage, 1
made, 1
in, 1
his, 1
earliest, 1
youth., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
your, 1
treasures.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
smiled,, 1
and,, 1
proceeding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
disused, 1
fireplace,, 1
raised,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
his, 1
chisel,, 1
a, 1
long, 1
stone,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
doubtless, 1
been, 1
the, 1
hearth,, 1
beneath, 1
which, 1
was, 1
a, 1
cavity, 1
of, 1
considerable, 1
depth,, 1
serving, 1
as, 1
a, 1
safe, 1
depository, 1
of, 1
the, 1
articles, 1
mentioned, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
first?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Oh,, 1
your, 1
great, 1
work, 1
on, 1
the, 1
monarchy, 1
of, 1
Italy!", 1
Faria, 1
then, 1
drew, 1
forth, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hiding-place, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
rolls, 1
of, 1
linen,, 1
laid, 1
one, 1
over, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
like, 1
folds, 1
of, 1
papyrus., 1
These, 1
rolls, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
slips, 1
of, 1
cloth, 1
about, 1
four, 1
inches, 1
wide, 1
and, 1
eighteen, 1
long;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
all, 1
carefully, 1
numbered, 1
and, 1
closely, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
writing,, 1
so, 1
legible, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
easily, 1
read, 1
it,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
make, 1
out, 1
the, 1
sense--it, 1
being, 1
in, 1
Italian,, 1
a, 1
language, 1
he,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Provencal,, 1
perfectly, 1
understood., 1
"There,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
the, 1
work, 1
complete., 1
I, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
word, 1
finis, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sixty-eighth, 1
strip, 1
about, 1
a, 1
week, 1
ago., 1
I, 1
have, 1
torn, 1
up, 1
two, 1
of, 1
my, 1
shirts,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
many, 1
handkerchiefs, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
master, 1
of,, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
the, 1
precious, 1
pages., 1
Should, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
get, 1
out, 1
of, 1
prison, 1
and, 1
find, 1
in, 1
all, 1
Italy, 1
a, 1
printer, 1
courageous, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
publish, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
composed,, 1
my, 1
literary, 1
reputation, 1
is, 1
forever, 1
secured.", 1
"I, 1
see,", 1
answered, 1
Dantes., 1
"Now, 1
let, 1
me, 1
behold, 1
the, 1
curious, 1
pens, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
written, 1
your, 1
work.", 1
"Look!", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
showing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
a, 1
slender, 1
stick, 1
about, 1
six, 1
inches, 1
long,, 1
and, 1
much, 1
resembling, 1
the, 1
size, 1
of, 1
the, 1
handle, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
painting-brush,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
tied,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
thread,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
cartilages, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
before, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
Dantes;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
pointed,, 1
and, 1
divided, 1
at, 1
the, 1
nib, 1
like, 1
an, 1
ordinary, 1
pen., 1
Dantes, 1
examined, 1
it, 1
with, 1
intense, 1
admiration,, 1
then, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
instrument, 1
with, 1
which, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
shaped, 1
so, 1
correctly, 1
into, 1
form., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Faria;, 1
"the, 1
penknife., 1
That's, 1
my, 1
masterpiece., 1
I, 1
made, 1
it,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
this, 1
larger, 1
knife,, 1
out, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
iron, 1
candlestick.", 1
The, 1
penknife, 1
was, 1
sharp, 1
and, 1
keen, 1
as, 1
a, 1
razor;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
the, 1
other, 1
knife,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
serve, 1
a, 1
double, 1
purpose,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
it, 1
one, 1
could, 1
cut, 1
and, 1
thrust., 1
Dantes, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
various, 1
articles, 1
shown, 1
to, 1
him, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
attention, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
curiosities, 1
and, 1
strange, 1
tools, 1
exhibited, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shops, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
as, 1
the, 1
works, 1
of, 1
the, 1
savages, 1
in, 1
the, 1
South, 1
Seas, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
brought, 1
by, 1
the, 1
different, 1
trading, 1
vessels., 1
"As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
ink,", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
how, 1
I, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
that--and, 1
I, 1
only, 1
just, 1
make, 1
it, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
require, 1
it.", 1
"One, 1
thing, 1
still, 1
puzzles, 1
me,", 1
observed, 1
Dantes,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
how, 1
you, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
do, 1
all, 1
this, 1
by, 1
daylight?", 1
"I, 1
worked, 1
at, 1
night, 1
also,", 1
replied, 1
Faria., 1
"Night!--why,, 1
for, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
are, 1
your, 1
eyes, 1
like, 1
cats',, 1
that, 1
you, 1
can, 1
see, 1
to, 1
work, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark?", 1
"Indeed, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not;, 1
but, 1
God, 1
has, 1
supplied, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
intelligence, 1
that, 1
enables, 1
him, 1
to, 1
overcome, 1
the, 1
limitations, 1
of, 1
natural, 1
conditions., 1
I, 1
furnished, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
a, 1
light.", 1
"You, 1
did?, 1
Pray, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
how.", 1
"I, 1
separated, 1
the, 1
fat, 1
from, 1
the, 1
meat, 1
served, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
melted, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
made, 1
oil--here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
lamp.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
exhibited, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
torch, 1
very, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
those, 1
used, 1
in, 1
public, 1
illuminations., 1
"But, 1
light?", 1
"Here, 1
are, 1
two, 1
flints, 1
and, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
burnt, 1
linen.", 1
"And, 1
matches?", 1
"I, 1
pretended, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
disorder, 1
of, 1
the, 1
skin,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
little, 1
sulphur,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
readily, 1
supplied.", 1
Dantes, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
different, 1
things, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
drooping, 1
on, 1
his, 1
breast,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
overwhelmed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
perseverance, 1
and, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
Faria's, 1
mind., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
all, 1
yet,", 1
continued, 1
Faria,, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
it, 1
wise, 1
to, 1
trust, 1
all, 1
my, 1
treasures, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hiding-place., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
shut, 1
this, 1
one, 1
up.", 1
They, 1
put, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
back, 1
in, 1
its, 1
place;, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
sprinkled, 1
a, 1
little, 1
dust, 1
over, 1
it, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
its, 1
having, 1
been, 1
removed,, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
well, 1
on, 1
it, 1
to, 1
make, 1
it, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
same, 1
appearance, 1
as, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
going, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
he, 1
removed, 1
it, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
it, 1
stood, 1
in., 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
fitting, 1
in, 1
so, 1
closely, 1
as, 1
to, 1
defy, 1
all, 1
suspicion,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
hollow, 1
space,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
this, 1
space, 1
a, 1
ladder, 1
of, 1
cords, 1
between, 1
twenty-five, 1
and, 1
thirty, 1
feet, 1
in, 1
length., 1
Dantes, 1
closely, 1
and, 1
eagerly, 1
examined, 1
it;, 1
he, 1
found, 1
it, 1
firm,, 1
solid,, 1
and, 1
compact, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
any, 1
weight., 1
"Who, 1
supplied, 1
you, 1
with, 1
the, 1
materials, 1
for, 1
making, 1
this, 1
wonderful, 1
work?", 1
"I, 1
tore, 1
up, 1
several, 1
of, 1
my, 1
shirts,, 1
and, 1
ripped, 1
out, 1
the, 1
seams, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sheets, 1
of, 1
my, 1
bed,, 1
during, 1
my, 1
three, 1
years', 1
imprisonment, 1
at, 1
Fenestrelle;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
removed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
I, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
ravellings, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
my, 1
work, 1
here.", 1
"And, 1
was, 1
it, 1
not, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
your, 1
sheets, 1
were, 1
unhemmed?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
for, 1
when, 1
I, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
out, 1
the, 1
thread, 1
I, 1
required,, 1
I, 1
hemmed, 1
the, 1
edges, 1
over, 1
again.", 1
"With, 1
what?", 1
"With, 1
this, 1
needle,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
as,, 1
opening, 1
his, 1
ragged, 1
vestments,, 1
he, 1
showed, 1
Dantes, 1
a, 1
long,, 1
sharp, 1
fish-bone,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
small, 1
perforated, 1
eye, 1
for, 1
the, 1
thread,, 1
a, 1
small, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
which, 1
still, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
it., 1
"I, 1
once, 1
thought,", 1
continued, 1
Faria,, 1
"of, 1
removing, 1
these, 1
iron, 1
bars,, 1
and, 1
letting, 1
myself, 1
down, 1
from, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
is, 1
somewhat, 1
wider, 1
than, 1
yours,, 1
although, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
enlarged, 1
it, 1
still, 1
more, 1
preparatory, 1
to, 1
my, 1
flight;, 1
however,, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
merely, 1
have, 1
dropped, 1
into, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
inner, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
therefore, 1
renounced, 1
the, 1
project, 1
altogether, 1
as, 1
too, 1
full, 1
of, 1
risk, 1
and, 1
danger., 1
Nevertheless,, 1
I, 1
carefully, 1
preserved, 1
my, 1
ladder, 1
against, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
unforeseen, 1
opportunities, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
just, 1
now,, 1

which, 1
sudden, 1
chance, 1
frequently, 1
brings, 1
about.", 1
While, 1
affecting, 1
to, 1
be, 1
deeply, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
ladder,, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
busily, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
a, 1
person, 1
so, 1
intelligent,, 1
ingenious,, 1
and, 1
clear-sighted, 1
as, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
might, 1
probably, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
solve, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
mystery, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
misfortunes,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
could, 1
see, 1
nothing., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
thinking, 1
of?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
smilingly,, 1
imputing, 1
the, 1
deep, 1
abstraction, 1
in, 1
which, 1
his, 1
visitor, 1
was, 1
plunged, 1
to, 1
the, 1
excess, 1
of, 1
his, 1
awe, 1
and, 1
wonder., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
reflecting,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
"upon, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
intelligence, 1
and, 1
ability, 1
you, 1
must, 1

employed, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
high, 1
perfection, 1
to, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
attained., 1
What, 1
would, 1
you, 1
not, 1

"Possibly, 1
nothing, 1

of, 1
my, 1

"No,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
"I, 1
know, 1
nothing., 1
Some, 1
of, 1
your, 1
words, 1
are, 1

me, 1

passed, 1
through, 1
any, 1
very, 1
important, 1
events.", 1
"It, 1
has, 1
been, 1
long, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
inflict, 1
on, 1
me, 1
a, 1
great, 1
and, 1
undeserved, 1
misfortune., 1
I, 1
would, 1
fain, 1
fix, 1
the, 1
source, 1
of, 1
it, 1
on, 1
man, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
vent, 1
reproaches, 1
upon, 1

"Then, 1
you, 1
profess, 1
ignorance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
are, 1
charged?", 1
"I, 1
do,, 1
indeed;, 1
and, 1
this, 1

"Come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
closing, 1
his, 1
hiding-place,, 1
and, 1
pushing, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
back, 1
to, 1
its, 1
original, 1
situation,, 1
"let, 1
me, 1
hear, 1
your, 1
story.", 1
Dantes, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
commenced, 1
what, 1
he, 1
called, 1
his, 1
history,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
consisted, 1
only, 1
of, 1
the, 1
account, 1
of, 1
a, 1
voyage, 1
to, 1
India,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
voyages, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Levant, 1
until, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
recital, 1
of, 1
his, 1
last, 1
cruise,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
to, 1
be, 1
delivered, 1
by, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
marshal;, 1
his, 1
interview, 1
with, 1
that, 1
personage,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
receiving,, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
packet, 1
brought,, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
Monsieur, 1
Noirtier--his, 1
arrival, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
interview, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father--his, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
Mercedes,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
nuptual, 1
feast--his, 1
arrest, 1
and, 1
subsequent, 1
examination,, 1
his, 1
temporary, 1
detention, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
de, 1
Justice,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
final, 1
imprisonment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
From, 1
this, 1
point, 1
everything, 1
was, 1
a, 1
blank, 1
to, 1
Dantes--he, 1
knew, 1
nothing, 1
more,, 1
not, 1
even, 1
the, 1
length, 1
of, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
imprisoned., 1
His, 1
recital, 1
finished,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
reflected, 1
long, 1
and, 1
earnestly., 1
"There, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
his, 1
meditations,, 1
"a, 1
clever, 1
maxim,, 1
which, 1
bears, 1
upon, 1
what, 1
I, 1
was, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
you, 1
some, 1
little, 1
while, 1
ago,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
unless, 1
wicked, 1
ideas, 1
take, 1
root, 1
in, 1
a, 1
naturally, 1
depraved, 1
mind,, 1
human, 1
nature,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
right, 1
and, 1
wholesome, 1
state,, 1
revolts, 1
at, 1
crime., 1
Still,, 1
from, 1
an, 1
artificial, 1
civilization, 1
have, 1
originated, 1
wants,, 1
vices,, 1
and, 1
false, 1
tastes,, 1
which, 1
occasionally, 1
become, 1
so, 1
powerful, 1
as, 1
to, 1
stifle, 1
within, 1
us, 1
all, 1
good, 1
feelings,, 1
and, 1
ultimately, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
us, 1
into, 1
guilt, 1
and, 1
wickedness., 1
From, 1
this, 1
view, 1
of, 1
things,, 1
then,, 1
comes, 1
the, 1
axiom, 1
that, 1
if, 1
you, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
author, 1
of, 1
any, 1
bad, 1
action,, 1
seek, 1
first, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
perpetration, 1
of, 1
that, 1
bad, 1
action, 1
could, 1
be, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
advantageous., 1
Now,, 1
to, 1
apply, 1
it, 1
in, 1
your, 1
case,--to, 1
whom, 1
could, 1
your, 1
disappearance, 1
have, 1
been, 1
serviceable?", 1
"To, 1
no, 1
one,, 1
by, 1
heaven!, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
insignificant, 1
person.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
thus,, 1
for, 1
your, 1
reply, 1
evinces, 1
neither, 1
logic, 1
nor, 1
philosophy;, 1
everything, 1
is, 1
relative,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
young, 1
friend,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
king, 1
who, 1
stands, 1
in, 1
the, 1
way, 1
of, 1
his, 1
successor,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
employee, 1
who, 1
keeps, 1
his, 1
rival, 1
out, 1
of, 1
a, 1
place., 1
Now,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
event, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
death,, 1
his, 1
successor, 1
inherits, 1
a, 1
crown,--when, 1
the, 1
employee, 1
dies,, 1
the, 1
supernumerary, 1
steps, 1
into, 1
his, 1
shoes,, 1
and, 1
receives, 1
his, 1
salary, 1
of, 1
twelve, 1
thousand, 1
livres., 1
Well,, 1
these, 1
twelve, 1
thousand, 1
livres, 1
are, 1
his, 1
civil, 1
list,, 1
and, 1
are, 1
as, 1
essential, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
the, 1
twelve, 1
millions, 1
of, 1
a, 1
king., 1
Every, 1
one,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
to, 1
the, 1
lowest, 1
degree,, 1
has, 1
his, 1
place, 1
on, 1
the, 1
social, 1
ladder,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
beset, 1
by, 1
stormy, 1
passions, 1
and, 1
conflicting, 1
interests,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
Descartes', 1
theory, 1
of, 1
pressure, 1
and, 1
impulsion., 1
But, 1
these, 1
forces, 1
increase, 1
as, 1
we, 1
go, 1
higher,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
a, 1
spiral, 1
which, 1
in, 1
defiance, 1
of, 1
reason, 1
rests, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
apex, 1
and, 1
not, 1
on, 1
the, 1
base., 1
Now, 1
let, 1
us, 1
return, 1
to, 1
your, 1
particular, 1
world., 1
You, 1
say, 1
you, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
being, 1
made, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
about, 1
to, 1
become, 1
the, 1
husband, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
lovely, 1
girl?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Now,, 1
could, 1
any, 1
one, 1
have, 1
had, 1
any, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
preventing, 1
the, 1
accomplishment, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
things?, 1
But, 1
let, 1
us, 1
first, 1
settle, 1
the, 1
question, 1
as, 1
to, 1
its, 1
being, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
of, 1
any, 1
one, 1
to, 1
hinder, 1
you, 1
from, 1
being, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon., 1
What, 1
say, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
believe, 1
such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
case., 1
I, 1
was, 1
generally, 1
liked, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
possessed, 1
the, 1
right, 1
of, 1
selecting, 1
a, 1
captain, 1
themselves,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
convinced, 1
their, 1
choice, 1
would, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
me., 1
There, 1
was, 1
only, 1
one, 1
person, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
who, 1
had, 1
any, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
ill-will, 1
towards, 1
me., 1
I, 1
had, 1
quarelled, 1
with, 1
him, 1
some, 1
time, 1
previously,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
even, 1
challenged, 1
him, 1
to, 1
fight, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
refused.", 1
"Now, 1
we, 1
are, 1
getting, 1
on., 1
And, 1
what, 1
was, 1
this, 1
man's, 1
name?", 1
"Danglars.", 1
"What, 1
rank, 1
did, 1
he, 1
hold, 1
on, 1
board?", 1
"He, 1
was, 1
supercargo.", 1
"And, 1
had, 1
you, 1
been, 1
captain,, 1
should, 1
you, 1
have, 1
retained, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
employment?", 1
"Not, 1
if, 1
the, 1
choice, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
had, 1
frequently, 1
observed, 1
inaccuracies, 1
in, 1
his, 1
accounts.", 1
"Good, 1
again!, 1
Now, 1
then,, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
was, 1
any, 1
person, 1
present, 1
during, 1
your, 1
last, 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere?", 1
"No;, 1
we, 1
were, 1
quite, 1
alone.", 1
"Could, 1
your, 1
conversation, 1
have, 1
been, 1
overheard, 1
by, 1
any, 1
one?", 1
"It, 1
might,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
cabin, 1
door, 1
was, 1
open--and--stay;, 1
now, 1
I, 1
recollect,--Danglars, 1
himself, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Captain, 1
Leclere, 1
was, 1
giving, 1
me, 1
the, 1
packet, 1
for, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
marshal.", 1
"That's, 1
better,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"now, 1
we, 1
are, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right, 1
scent., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
take, 1
anybody, 1
with, 1
you, 1
when, 1
you, 1
put, 1
into, 1
the, 1
port, 1
of, 1
Elba?", 1
"Nobody.", 1
"Somebody, 1
there, 1
received, 1
your, 1
packet,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
you, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
"Yes;, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
marshal, 1
did.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
that, 1
letter?", 1
"Put, 1
it, 1
into, 1
my, 1
portfolio.", 1
"You, 1
had, 1
your, 1
portfolio, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
then?, 1
Now,, 1
how, 1
could, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
find, 1
room, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
for, 1
a, 1
portfolio, 1
large, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
contain, 1
an, 1
official, 1
letter?", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
left, 1
on, 1
board.", 1
"Then, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
till, 1
your, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
that, 1
you, 1
put, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
the, 1
portfolio?", 1
"No.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
this, 1
same, 1
letter, 1
while, 1
returning, 1
from, 1
Porto-Ferrajo, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vessel?", 1
"I, 1
carried, 1
it, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hand.", 1
"So, 1
that, 1
when, 1
you, 1
went, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
everybody, 1
could, 1
see, 1
that, 1
you, 1
held, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hand?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Danglars,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
rest?", 1
"Danglars,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
others.", 1
"Now,, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
try, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
every, 1
circumstance, 1
attending, 1
your, 1
arrest., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
recollect, 1
the, 1
words, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
information, 1
against, 1
you, 1
was, 1
formulated?", 1
"Oh, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
read, 1
it, 1
over, 1
three, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
words, 1
sank, 1
deeply, 1
into, 1
my, 1
memory.", 1
"Repeat, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Dantes, 1
paused, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
"This, 1
is, 1
it,, 1
word, 1
for, 1
word:, 1
'The, 1
king's, 1

with, 1
a, 1

The, 1
abbe, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"The, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
clear, 1
as, 1
day,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1

a, 1
handsome,, 1
running, 1

how, 1
was, 1

abbe, 1
smiled., 1
"Disguised.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
very, 1
boldly, 1
written,, 1

disguised.", 1
"Stop, 1
a, 1
bit,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
what, 1
he, 1
called, 1
his, 1
pen,, 1

after, 1
dipping, 1
it, 1
into, 1

left, 1

the, 1
first, 1
two, 1

three, 1

Dantes, 1
drew, 1
back,, 1

gazed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sensation, 1
almost, 1
amounting, 1
to, 1
terror., 1
"How, 1
very, 1
astonishing!", 1
cried, 1
he, 1
at, 1
length., 1
"Why, 1
your, 1

exactly, 1
resembles, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
accusation.", 1
"Simply, 1
because, 1

had, 1
been, 1

person, 1

is, 1
a, 1
Spanish, 1
name,, 1

was, 1
a, 1
Catalan.", 1

imagine, 1
him, 1
capable, 1
of, 1

no;, 1
he, 1
would, 1

a, 1
little., 1
Pray,, 1
was, 1
Danglars, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
Fernand?", 1
"No--yes,, 1
he, 1
was., 1
Now, 1
I, 1
recollect"--, 1
"What?", 1
"To, 1
have, 1

were, 1
in, 1
earnest, 1
conversation., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
joking, 1
in, 1
a, 1
friendly, 1
way,, 1

Fernand, 1
looked, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
agitated.", 1
"Were, 1
they, 1
alone?", 1
"There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
third, 1
person, 1
with, 1
them, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
perfectly, 1
well,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
made, 1
their, 1
acquaintance;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tailor, 1
named, 1
Caderousse,, 1

he, 1
was, 1
very, 1

Stay!--stay!--How, 1
strange, 1
that, 1

should, 1
not, 1

well,, 1
that, 1
on, 1

table, 1
round, 1

were, 1
sitting, 1
were, 1
pens,, 1
ink,, 1

Oh,, 1
the, 1
heartless,, 1
treacherous, 1
scoundrels!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes,, 1
pressing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
throbbing, 1
brows., 1
"Is, 1
there, 1
anything, 1
else, 1

can, 1

you, 1
in, 1
discovering,, 1

with, 1
a, 1
laugh., 1

yes,", 1

eagerly;, 1

to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1

mystery, 1
seems, 1

an, 1
easy, 1
riddle,, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
me, 1
how, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
I, 1
underwent, 1
no, 1
second, 1
examination,, 1
was, 1
never, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
trial,, 1

above, 1
all,, 1
was, 1
condemned, 1
without, 1
ever, 1
having, 1
had, 1
sentence, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
me?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
altogether, 1
a, 1
different, 1
and, 1
more, 1
serious, 1
matter,", 1
responded, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"The, 1
ways, 1
of, 1
justice, 1
are, 1
frequently, 1

dark, 1

easily, 1
penetrated., 1
All, 1
we, 1
have, 1
hitherto, 1
done, 1
in, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
has, 1
been, 1
child's, 1

for,, 1
in, 1
good, 1
truth,, 1

you,--the, 1

attorney,, 1

deputy,, 1

a, 1
magistrate?", 1
"The, 1
deputy.", 1

he, 1
young, 1

old?", 1

six, 1

seven, 1

twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1

should, 1

"So,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Old, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
be, 1

too, 1
young, 1

did, 1
he, 1
treat, 1
you?", 1
"With, 1
more, 1
of, 1
mildness, 1

you, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
your, 1
whole, 1

did.", 1

did, 1
his, 1
conduct, 1
change, 1
at, 1
all, 1
in, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
your, 1
examination?", 1
"He, 1
did, 1
appear, 1
much, 1
disturbed, 1
when, 1
he, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
that, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
me, 1
into, 1
this, 1

overcome, 1
by, 1
my, 1

"By, 1
your, 1
misfortune?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
it, 1

your, 1
misfortune, 1
he, 1
deplored?", 1
"He, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
one, 1
great, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sympathy,, 1
at, 1
any, 1
rate.", 1
"And, 1
that?", 1
"He, 1
burnt, 1

sole, 1
evidence, 1
that, 1
could, 1
at, 1

the, 1
letter.", 1

you, 1
sure?", 1

natural.", 1
"You, 1

so?", 1

am, 1

bright, 1
light, 1
shot, 1
through, 1

cleared, 1
up, 1

magistrate,, 1

seemed, 1
rather, 1
to, 1

mercy, 1

to, 1
pronounce, 1
punishment,--all, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stunning, 1
force, 1
to, 1
his, 1
memory., 1
He, 1
cried, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
staggered, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
like, 1
a, 1
drunken, 1
man,, 1

from, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
cell, 1

he, 1
regained, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1

the, 1
turnkey, 1
found, 1
him, 1
in, 1

evening, 1

sitting, 1
with, 1
fixed, 1
gaze, 1
and, 1
contracted, 1
features,, 1
dumb, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
a, 1
statue., 1
During, 1
these, 1
hours, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
meditation,, 1

to, 1
him, 1
had, 1
seemed, 1
only, 1
minutes,, 1

had, 1
formed, 1

resolution,, 1

bound, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
its, 1
fulfilment, 1
by, 1
a, 1
solemn, 1
oath., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
at, 1
length, 1
roused, 1
from, 1
his, 1
revery, 1
by, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
Faria,, 1
who,, 1
having, 1
also, 1
been, 1
visited, 1
by, 1
his, 1
jailer,, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
invite, 1
his, 1
fellow-sufferer, 1
to, 1
share, 1
his, 1
supper., 1
The, 1
reputation, 1
of, 1
being, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1

harmlessly, 1
and, 1
even, 1
amusingly, 1
so,, 1
had, 1
procured, 1
for, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
unusual, 1
privileges., 1
He, 1
was, 1
supplied, 1
with, 1
bread, 1
of, 1
a, 1
finer,, 1
whiter, 1
quality, 1
than, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
prison, 1
fare,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
regaled, 1
each, 1
Sunday, 1
with, 1
a, 1
small, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
wine., 1
Now, 1
this, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Sunday,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
his, 1
young, 1
companion, 1
to, 1
share, 1
the, 1
luxuries, 1
with, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
followed;, 1
his, 1
features, 1
were, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
contracted,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
wore, 1
their, 1
usual, 1
expression,, 1
but, 1
there, 1
was, 1
that, 1
in, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
appearance, 1
that, 1
bespoke, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
a, 1
fixed, 1
and, 1
desperate, 1
resolve., 1
Faria, 1
bent, 1
on, 1
him, 1
his, 1
penetrating, 1
eye:, 1
"I, 1
regret, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"having, 1
helped, 1
you, 1
in, 1
your, 1
late, 1
inquiries,, 1
or, 1
having, 1
given, 1
you, 1
the, 1
information, 1
I, 1
did.", 1
"Why, 1
so?", 1
inquired, 1
Dantes., 1
"Because, 1
it, 1
has, 1
instilled, 1
a, 1
new, 1
passion, 1
in, 1
your, 1
heart--that, 1
of, 1
vengeance.", 1
Dantes, 1
smiled., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
something, 1
else,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
Again, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
then, 1
mournfully, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
Dantes', 1
request,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
other, 1
matters., 1
The, 1
elder, 1
prisoner, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
persons, 1
whose, 1
conversation,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
all, 1
who, 1
have, 1
experienced, 1
many, 1
trials,, 1
contained, 1
many, 1
useful, 1
and, 1
important, 1
hints, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
sound, 1
information;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
never, 1
egotistical,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
man, 1
never, 1
alluded, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
sorrows., 1
Dantes, 1
listened, 1
with, 1
admiring, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
all, 1
he, 1
said;, 1
some, 1
of, 1
his, 1
remarks, 1
corresponded, 1
with, 1
what, 1
he, 1
already, 1
knew,, 1
or, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
knowledge, 1
his, 1
nautical, 1
life, 1
had, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
acquire., 1
A, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
good, 1
abbe's, 1
words,, 1
however,, 1
were, 1
wholly, 1
incomprehensible, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
but,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
aurora, 1
which, 1
guides, 1
the, 1
navigator, 1
in, 1
northern, 1
latitudes,, 1
opened, 1
new, 1
vistas, 1
to, 1
the, 1
inquiring, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
the, 1
listener,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
fantastic, 1
glimpses, 1
of, 1
new, 1
horizons,, 1
enabling, 1
him, 1
justly, 1
to, 1
estimate, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
an, 1
intellectual, 1
mind, 1
would, 1
have, 1
in, 1
following, 1
one, 1
so, 1
richly, 1
gifted, 1
as, 1
Faria, 1
along, 1
the, 1
heights, 1
of, 1
truth,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
so, 1
much, 1
at, 1
home., 1
"You, 1
must, 1
teach, 1
me, 1
a, 1
small, 1
part, 1
of, 1
what, 1
you, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"if, 1
only, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
your, 1
growing, 1
weary, 1
of, 1
me., 1
I, 1
can, 1
well, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
so, 1
learned, 1
a, 1
person, 1
as, 1
yourself, 1
would, 1
prefer, 1
absolute, 1
solitude, 1
to, 1
being, 1
tormented, 1
with, 1
the, 1
company, 1
of, 1
one, 1
as, 1
ignorant, 1
and, 1
uninformed, 1
as, 1
myself., 1
If, 1
you, 1
will, 1
only, 1
agree, 1
to, 1
my, 1
request,, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
never, 1
to, 1
mention, 1
another, 1
word, 1
about, 1
escaping.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
smiled., 1
"Alas,, 1
my, 1
boy,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"human, 1
knowledge, 1
is, 1
confined, 1
within, 1
very, 1
narrow, 1
limits;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
taught, 1
you, 1
mathematics,, 1
physics,, 1
history,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
modern, 1
languages, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
acquainted,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
know, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do, 1
myself., 1
Now,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
scarcely, 1
require, 1
two, 1
years, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
communicate, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
stock, 1
of, 1
learning, 1
I, 1
possess.", 1
"Two, 1
years!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
really, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
can, 1
acquire, 1
all, 1
these, 1
things, 1
in, 1
so, 1
short, 1
a, 1
time?", 1
"Not, 1
their, 1
application,, 1
certainly,, 1
but, 1
their, 1
principles, 1
you, 1
may;, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
know;, 1
there, 1
are, 1
the, 1
learners, 1
and, 1
the, 1
learned., 1
Memory, 1
makes, 1
the, 1
one,, 1
philosophy, 1
the, 1
other.", 1
"But, 1
cannot, 1
one, 1
learn, 1
philosophy?", 1
"Philosophy, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
taught;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
application, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sciences, 1
to, 1
truth;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
like, 1
the, 1
golden, 1
cloud, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Messiah, 1
went, 1
up, 1
into, 1
heaven.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"What, 1
shall, 1
you, 1
teach, 1
me, 1
first?, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hurry, 1
to, 1
begin., 1
I, 1
want, 1
to, 1
learn.", 1
"Everything,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
And, 1
that, 1
very, 1
evening, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
sketched, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
education,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entered, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day., 1
Dantes, 1
possessed, 1
a, 1
prodigious, 1
memory,, 1
combined, 1
with, 1
an, 1
astonishing, 1
quickness, 1
and, 1
readiness, 1
of, 1
conception;, 1
the, 1
mathematical, 1
turn, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
rendered, 1
him, 1
apt, 1
at, 1
all, 1
kinds, 1
of, 1
calculation,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
naturally, 1
poetical, 1
feelings, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
light, 1
and, 1
pleasing, 1
veil, 1
over, 1
the, 1
dry, 1
reality, 1
of, 1
arithmetical, 1
computation,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
rigid, 1
severity, 1
of, 1
geometry., 1
He, 1
already, 1
knew, 1
Italian,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
also, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
a, 1
little, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Romaic, 1
dialect, 1
during, 1
voyages, 1
to, 1
the, 1
East;, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
languages, 1
he, 1
easily, 1
comprehended, 1
the, 1
construction, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
others,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
six, 1
months, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
Spanish,, 1
English,, 1
and, 1
German., 1
In, 1
strict, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
made, 1
to, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
Dantes, 1
spoke, 1
no, 1
more, 1
of, 1
escape., 1
Perhaps, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
his, 1
studies, 1
afforded, 1
him, 1
left, 1
no, 1
room, 1
for, 1
such, 1
thoughts;, 1
perhaps, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
pledged, 1
his, 1
word, 1
(on, 1
which, 1
his, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
honor, 1
was, 1
keen), 1
kept, 1
him, 1
from, 1
referring, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
possibilities, 1
of, 1
flight., 1
Days,, 1
even, 1
months,, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
unheeded, 1
in, 1
one, 1
rapid, 1
and, 1
instructive, 1
course., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
year, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
a, 1
new, 1
man., 1
Dantes, 1
observed,, 1
however,, 1
that, 1
Faria,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
relief, 1
his, 1
society, 1
afforded,, 1
daily, 1
grew, 1
sadder;, 1
one, 1
thought, 1
seemed, 1
incessantly, 1
to, 1
harass, 1
and, 1
distract, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
Sometimes, 1
he, 1
would, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
long, 1
reveries,, 1
sigh, 1
heavily, 1
and, 1
involuntarily,, 1
then, 1
suddenly, 1
rise,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
folded, 1
arms,, 1
begin, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
confined, 1
space, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dungeon., 1
One, 1
day, 1
he, 1
stopped, 1
all, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
and, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"Ah,, 1
if, 1
there, 1
were, 1
no, 1
sentinel!", 1
"There, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
one, 1
a, 1
minute, 1
longer, 1
than, 1
you, 1
please,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
working, 1
of, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
as, 1
accurately, 1
as, 1
though, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
were, 1
enclosed, 1
in, 1
crystal, 1
so, 1
clear, 1
as, 1
to, 1
display, 1
its, 1
minutest, 1
operations., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
loathe, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
shedding, 1
blood.", 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
murder,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
choose, 1
to, 1
call, 1
it, 1
so,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
simply, 1
a, 1
measure, 1
of, 1
self-preservation.", 1
"No, 1
matter!, 1
I, 1
could, 1
never, 1
agree, 1
to, 1
it.", 1
"Still,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
"Incessantly,, 1
alas!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
regaining, 1
our, 1
freedom,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes, 1
eagerly., 1
"I, 1
have;, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
only, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
place, 1
a, 1
deaf, 1
and, 1
blind, 1
sentinel, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
beyond, 1
us.", 1
"He, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
both, 1
blind, 1
and, 1
deaf,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
determination, 1
that, 1
made, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
shudder., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"impossible!", 1
Dantes, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
the, 1
subject;, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
disapproval,, 1
and, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
make, 1
any, 1
further, 1
response., 1
Three, 1
months, 1
passed, 1
away., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
strong?", 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
asked, 1
one, 1
day, 1
of, 1
Dantes., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
in, 1
reply,, 1
took, 1
up, 1
the, 1
chisel,, 1
bent, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
form, 1
of, 1
a, 1
horseshoe,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
as, 1
readily, 1
straightened, 1
it., 1
"And, 1
will, 1
you, 1
engage, 1
not, 1
to, 1
do, 1
any, 1
harm, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sentry,, 1
except, 1
as, 1
a, 1
last, 1
resort?", 1
"I, 1
promise, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"we, 1
may, 1
hope, 1
to, 1
put, 1
our, 1
design, 1
into, 1
execution.", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
long, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
be, 1
in, 1
accomplishing, 1
the, 1
necessary, 1
work?", 1
"At, 1
least, 1
a, 1
year.", 1
"And, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
begin, 1
at, 1
once?", 1
"At, 1
once.", 1
"We, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
a, 1
year, 1
to, 1
no, 1
purpose!", 1
cried, 1
Dantes., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
consider, 1
the, 1
last, 1
twelve, 1
months, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
wasted?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Forgive, 1
me!", 1
cried, 1
Edmond,, 1
blushing, 1
deeply., 1
"Tut,, 1
tut!", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"man, 1
is, 1
but, 1
man, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
about, 1
the, 1
best, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
genus, 1
I, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
known., 1
Come,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
show, 1
you, 1
my, 1
plan.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
then, 1
showed, 1
Dantes, 1
the, 1
sketch, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
for, 1
their, 1
escape., 1
It, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
cell, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
which, 1
united, 1
them., 1
In, 1
this, 1
passage, 1
he, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
a, 1
level, 1
as, 1
they, 1
do, 1
in, 1
mines;, 1
this, 1
level, 1
would, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
two, 1
prisoners, 1
immediately, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
where, 1
the, 1
sentry, 1
kept, 1
watch;, 1
once, 1
there,, 1
a, 1
large, 1
excavation, 1
would, 1
be, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
flag-stones, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
was, 1
paved, 1
be, 1
so, 1
completely, 1
loosened, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
desired, 1
moment, 1
it, 1
would, 1
give, 1
way, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
the, 1
soldier,, 1
who,, 1
stunned, 1
by, 1
his, 1
fall,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
immediately, 1
bound, 1
and, 1
gagged, 1
by, 1
Dantes, 1
before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
power, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
any, 1
resistance., 1
The, 1
prisoners, 1
were, 1
then, 1
to, 1
make, 1
their, 1
way, 1
through, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
let, 1
themselves, 1
down, 1
from, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
walls, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
ladder, 1
of, 1
cords., 1
Dantes', 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
with, 1
joy,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
delight, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
so, 1
simple,, 1
yet, 1
apparently, 1
so, 1
certain, 1
to, 1
succeed., 1
That, 1
very, 1
day, 1
the, 1
miners, 1
began, 1
their, 1
labors,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
vigor, 1
and, 1
alacrity, 1
proportionate, 1
to, 1
their, 1
long, 1
rest, 1
from, 1
fatigue, 1
and, 1
their, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
ultimate, 1
success., 1
Nothing, 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
progress, 1
of, 1
the, 1
work, 1
except, 1
the, 1
necessity, 1
that, 1
each, 1
was, 1
under, 1
of, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
his, 1
cell, 1
in, 1
anticipation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
turnkey's, 1
visits., 1
They, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
imperceptible, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
his, 1
footsteps, 1
as, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
towards, 1
their, 1
dungeons,, 1
and, 1
happily,, 1
never, 1
failed, 1
of, 1
being, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
his, 1
coming., 1
The, 1
fresh, 1
earth, 1
excavated, 1
during, 1
their, 1
present, 1
work,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
entirely, 1
blocked, 1
up, 1
the, 1
old, 1
passage,, 1
was, 1
thrown,, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
precaution,, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window, 1
in, 1
either, 1
Faria's, 1
or, 1
Dantes', 1
cell,, 1
the, 1
rubbish, 1
being, 1
first, 1
pulverized, 1
so, 1
finely, 1
that, 1
the, 1
night, 1
wind, 1
carried, 1
it, 1
far, 1
away, 1
without, 1
permitting, 1
the, 1
smallest, 1
trace, 1
to, 1
remain., 1
More, 1
than, 1
a, 1
year, 1
had, 1
been, 1
consumed, 1
in, 1
this, 1
undertaking,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
tools, 1
for, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
chisel,, 1
a, 1
knife,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
wooden, 1
lever;, 1
Faria, 1
still, 1
continuing, 1
to, 1
instruct, 1
Dantes, 1
by, 1
conversing, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
sometimes, 1
in, 1
one, 1
language,, 1
sometimes, 1
in, 1
another;, 1
at, 1
others,, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
nations, 1
and, 1
great, 1
men, 1
who, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
have, 1
risen, 1
to, 1
fame, 1
and, 1
trodden, 1
the, 1
path, 1
of, 1
glory., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
had,, 1
moreover,, 1
mixed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
society, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day;, 1
he, 1
wore, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
melancholy, 1
dignity, 1
which, 1
Dantes,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
imitative, 1
powers, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
by, 1
nature,, 1
easily, 1
acquired,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
that, 1
outward, 1
polish, 1
and, 1
politeness, 1
he, 1
had, 1
before, 1
been, 1
wanting, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
is, 1
seldom, 1
possessed, 1
except, 1
by, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
intercourse, 1
with, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
high, 1
birth, 1
and, 1
breeding., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
fifteen, 1
months, 1
the, 1
level, 1
was, 1
finished,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
excavation, 1
completed, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
gallery,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
workmen, 1
could, 1
distinctly, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
measured, 1
tread, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sentinel, 1
as, 1
he, 1
paced, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro, 1
over, 1
their, 1
heads., 1
Compelled,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
to, 1
await, 1
a, 1
night, 1
sufficiently, 1
dark, 1
to, 1
favor, 1
their, 1
flight,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
defer, 1
their, 1
final, 1
attempt, 1
till, 1
that, 1
auspicious, 1
moment, 1
should, 1
arrive;, 1
their, 1
greatest, 1
dread, 1
now, 1
was, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
through, 1
which, 1
the, 1
sentry, 1
was, 1
doomed, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
should, 1
give, 1
way, 1
before, 1
its, 1
right, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
they, 1
had, 1
in, 1
some, 1
measure, 1
provided, 1
against, 1
by, 1
propping, 1
it, 1
up, 1
with, 1
a, 1
small, 1
beam, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
discovered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
through, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
worked, 1
their, 1
way., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
arranging, 1
this, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
wood, 1
when, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
Faria,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
Edmond's, 1
cell, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
cutting, 1
a, 1
peg, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
their, 1
rope-ladder,, 1
call, 1
to, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
indicative, 1
of, 1
great, 1
suffering., 1
Dantes, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
his, 1
dungeon,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
found, 1
him, 1
standing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
death,, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
streaming, 1
with, 1
perspiration,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
clinched, 1
tightly, 1
together., 1
"Gracious, 1
heavens!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
what, 1
has, 1
happened?", 1
"Quick!, 1
quick!", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"listen, 1
to, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
say.", 1
Dantes, 1
looked, 1
in, 1
fear, 1
and, 1
wonder, 1
at, 1
the, 1
livid, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
Faria,, 1
whose, 1
eyes,, 1
already, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
sunken,, 1
were, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
purple, 1
circles,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
were, 1
white, 1
as, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
corpse,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
very, 1
hair, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
on, 1
end., 1
"Tell, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
what, 1
ails, 1
you?", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
letting, 1
his, 1
chisel, 1
fall, 1
to, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
"Alas,", 1
faltered, 1
out, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"all, 1
is, 1
over, 1
with, 1
me., 1
I, 1
am, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
a, 1
terrible,, 1
perhaps, 1
mortal, 1
illness;, 1
I, 1
can, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
the, 1
paroxysm, 1
is, 1
fast, 1
approaching., 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
attack, 1
the, 1
year, 1
previous, 1
to, 1
my, 1
imprisonment., 1
This, 1
malady, 1
admits, 1
but, 1
of, 1
one, 1
remedy;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what, 1
that, 1
is., 1
Go, 1
into, 1
my, 1
cell, 1
as, 1
quickly, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can;, 1
draw, 1
out, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
that, 1
support, 1
the, 1
bed;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
it, 1
has, 1
been, 1
hollowed, 1
out, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
containing, 1
a, 1
small, 1
phial, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
there, 1
half-filled, 1
with, 1
a, 1
red-looking, 1
fluid., 1
Bring, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me--or, 1
rather--no,, 1
no!--I, 1
may, 1
be, 1
found, 1
here,, 1
therefore, 1
help, 1
me, 1
back, 1
to, 1
my, 1
room, 1
while, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
drag, 1
myself, 1
along., 1
Who, 1
knows, 1
what, 1
may, 1
happen,, 1
or, 1
how, 1
long, 1
the, 1
attack, 1
may, 1
last?", 1
In, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magnitude, 1
of, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
which, 1
thus, 1
suddenly, 1
frustrated, 1
his, 1
hopes,, 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
mind,, 1
but, 1
descended, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
dragging, 1
his, 1
unfortunate, 1
companion, 1
with, 1
him;, 1
then,, 1
half-carrying,, 1
half-supporting, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
chamber,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
immediately, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
sufferer, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed., 1
"Thanks,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
abbe,, 1
shivering, 1
as, 1
though, 1
his, 1
veins, 1
were, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
ice., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
catalepsy;, 1
when, 1
it, 1
comes, 1
to, 1
its, 1
height, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
probably, 1
lie, 1
still, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
though, 1
dead,, 1
uttering, 1
neither, 1
sigh, 1
nor, 1
groan., 1
On, 1
the, 1
other, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
symptoms, 1
may, 1
be, 1
much, 1
more, 1
violent,, 1
and, 1
cause, 1
me, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
fearful, 1
convulsions,, 1
foam, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
cry, 1
out, 1
loudly., 1
Take, 1
care, 1
my, 1
cries, 1
are, 1
not, 1
heard,, 1
for, 1
if, 1
they, 1
are, 1
it, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
probable, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
removed, 1
to, 1
another, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
forever., 1
When, 1
I, 1
become, 1
quite, 1
motionless,, 1
cold,, 1
and, 1
rigid, 1
as, 1
a, 1
corpse,, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
before,--be, 1
careful, 1
about, 1
this,--force, 1
open, 1
my, 1
teeth, 1
with, 1
the, 1
knife,, 1
pour, 1
from, 1
eight, 1
to, 1
ten, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
the, 1
liquor, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
down, 1
my, 1
throat,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
may, 1
perhaps, 1
revive.", 1
"Perhaps!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes, 1
in, 1
grief-stricken, 1
tones., 1
"Help!, 1
help!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"I--I--die--I"--, 1
So, 1
sudden, 1
and, 1
violent, 1
was, 1
the, 1
fit, 1
that, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
prisoner, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
the, 1
sentence;, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
convulsion, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
frame,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
started, 1
from, 1
their, 1
sockets,, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
his, 1
cheeks, 1
became, 1
purple,, 1
he, 1
struggled,, 1
foamed,, 1
dashed, 1
himself, 1
about,, 1
and, 1
uttered, 1
the, 1
most, 1
dreadful, 1
cries,, 1
which,, 1
however,, 1
Dantes, 1
prevented, 1
from, 1
being, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
covering, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
the, 1
blanket., 1
The, 1
fit, 1
lasted, 1
two, 1
hours;, 1
then,, 1
more, 1
helpless, 1
than, 1
an, 1
infant,, 1
and, 1
colder, 1
and, 1
paler, 1
than, 1
marble,, 1
more, 1
crushed, 1
and, 1
broken, 1
than, 1
a, 1
reed, 1
trampled, 1
under, 1
foot,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
back,, 1
doubled, 1
up, 1
in, 1
one, 1
last, 1
convulsion,, 1
and, 1
became, 1
as, 1
rigid, 1
as, 1
a, 1
corpse., 1
Edmond, 1
waited, 1
till, 1
life, 1
seemed, 1
extinct, 1
in, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
then,, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
the, 1
knife,, 1
he, 1
with, 1
difficulty, 1
forced, 1
open, 1
the, 1
closely, 1
fixed, 1
jaws,, 1
carefully, 1
administered, 1
the, 1
appointed, 1
number, 1
of, 1
drops,, 1
and, 1
anxiously, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
result., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
passed, 1
away, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
gave, 1
no, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
returning, 1
animation., 1
Dantes, 1
began, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
he, 1
had, 1
delayed, 1
too, 1
long, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
administered, 1
the, 1
remedy,, 1
and,, 1
thrusting, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
into, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
continued, 1
gazing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lifeless, 1
features, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend., 1
At, 1
length, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
color, 1
tinged, 1
the, 1
livid, 1
cheeks,, 1
consciousness, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dull,, 1
open, 1
eyeballs,, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
sigh, 1
issued, 1
from, 1
the, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sufferer, 1
made, 1
a, 1
feeble, 1
effort, 1
to, 1
move., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
saved!, 1
he, 1
is, 1
saved!", 1
cried, 1
Dantes, 1
in, 1
a, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
delight., 1
The, 1
sick, 1
man, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
able, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
pointed, 1
with, 1
evident, 1
anxiety, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Dantes, 1
listened,, 1
and, 1
plainly, 1
distinguished, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jailer., 1
It, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
near, 1
seven, 1
o'clock;, 1
but, 1
Edmond's, 1
anxiety, 1
had, 1
put, 1
all, 1
thoughts, 1
of, 1
time, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
head., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
sprang, 1
to, 1
the, 1
entrance,, 1
darted, 1
through, 1
it,, 1
carefully, 1
drawing, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
over, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
and, 1
hurried, 1
to, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
He, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
done, 1
so, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
seated, 1
as, 1
usual, 1
on, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
his, 1
bed., 1
Almost, 1
before, 1
the, 1
key, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
and, 1
before, 1
the, 1
departing, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
had, 1
died, 1
away, 1
in, 1
the, 1
long, 1
corridor, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
traverse,, 1
Dantes,, 1
whose, 1
restless, 1
anxiety, 1
concerning, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
left, 1
him, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
touch, 1
the, 1
food, 1
brought, 1
him,, 1
hurried, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
chamber,, 1
and, 1
raising, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
by, 1
pressing, 1
his, 1
head, 1
against, 1
it,, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
sick, 1
man's, 1
couch., 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
now, 1
fully, 1
regained, 1
his, 1
consciousness,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
still, 1
lay, 1
helpless, 1
and, 1
exhausted., 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
feebly,, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
"And, 1
why, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
fancy, 1
yourself, 1
dying?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
no, 1
such, 1
idea;, 1
but,, 1
knowing, 1
that, 1
all, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
for, 1
flight,, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
might, 1
have, 1
made, 1
your, 1
escape.", 1
The, 1
deep, 1
glow, 1
of, 1
indignation, 1
suffused, 1
the, 1
cheeks, 1
of, 1
Dantes., 1
"Without, 1
you?, 1
Did, 1
you, 1
really, 1
think, 1
me, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
that?", 1
"At, 1
least,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"I, 1
now, 1
see, 1
how, 1
wrong, 1
such, 1
an, 1
opinion, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been., 1
Alas,, 1
alas!, 1
I, 1
am, 1
fearfully, 1
exhausted, 1
and, 1
debilitated, 1
by, 1
this, 1
attack.", 1
"Be, 1
of, 1
good, 1
cheer,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes;, 1
"your, 1
strength, 1
will, 1
return.", 1
And, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
he, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
near, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
beside, 1
Faria,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"The, 1
last, 1
attack, 1
I, 1
had,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"lasted, 1
but, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
it, 1
I, 1
was, 1
hungry,, 1
and, 1
got, 1
up, 1
without, 1
help;, 1
now, 1
I, 1
can, 1
move, 1
neither, 1
my, 1
right, 1
arm, 1
nor, 1
leg,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
head, 1
seems, 1
uncomfortable,, 1
which, 1
shows, 1
that, 1
there, 1
has, 1
been, 1
a, 1
suffusion, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brain., 1
The, 1
third, 1
attack, 1
will, 1
either, 1
carry, 1
me, 1
off,, 1
or, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
paralyzed, 1
for, 1
life.", 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
mistaken--you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
die!, 1
And, 1
your, 1
third, 1
attack, 1
(if,, 1
indeed,, 1
you, 1
should, 1
have, 1
another), 1
will, 1
find, 1
you, 1
at, 1
liberty., 1
We, 1
shall, 1
save, 1
you, 1
another, 1
time,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
done, 1
this,, 1
only, 1
with, 1
a, 1
better, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
success,, 1
because, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
command, 1
every, 1
requisite, 1
assistance.", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
Edmond,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"be, 1
not, 1
deceived., 1
The, 1
attack, 1
which, 1
has, 1
just, 1
passed, 1
away,, 1
condemns, 1
me, 1
forever, 1
to, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prison., 1
None, 1
can, 1
fly, 1
from, 1
a, 1
dungeon, 1
who, 1
cannot, 1
walk.", 1
"Well,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
wait,--a, 1
week,, 1
a, 1
month,, 1
two, 1
months,, 1
if, 1
need, 1
be,--and, 1
meanwhile, 1
your, 1
strength, 1
will, 1
return., 1
Everything, 1
is, 1
in, 1
readiness, 1
for, 1
our, 1
flight,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
can, 1
select, 1
any, 1
time, 1
we, 1
choose., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
able, 1
to, 1
swim, 1
we, 1
will, 1
go.", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
swim, 1
again,", 1
replied, 1
Faria., 1
"This, 1
arm, 1
is, 1
paralyzed;, 1
not, 1
for, 1
a, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
forever., 1
Lift, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
judge, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
mistaken.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
arm,, 1
which, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
by, 1
its, 1
own, 1
weight,, 1
perfectly, 1

escaped, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
convinced, 1
now,, 1
Edmond,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Depend, 1
upon, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
say., 1
Since, 1
the, 1
first, 1
attack, 1
I, 1
experienced, 1
of, 1
this, 1
malady,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
continually, 1
reflected, 1
on, 1
it., 1
Indeed,, 1
I, 1
expected, 1
it,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
family, 1
inheritance;, 1
both, 1
my, 1
father, 1

physician, 1
who, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1

have, 1
twice, 1
successfully, 1
taken,, 1
was, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
Cabanis,, 1

he, 1
predicted, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
end, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"The, 1
physician, 1
may, 1
be, 1
mistaken!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes., 1
"And, 1
as, 1
for, 1
your, 1
poor, 1
arm,, 1
what, 1
difference, 1
will, 1
that, 1
make?, 1
I, 1
can, 1
take, 1
you, 1
on, 1
my, 1
shoulders,, 1
and, 1
swim, 1
for, 1
both, 1
of, 1
us.", 1
"My, 1
son,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"you,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1

you, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
also, 1
remain.", 1
Then,, 1
rising, 1
and, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
solemnity, 1
over, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
head,, 1
he, 1
slowly, 1
added,, 1
"By, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
of, 1
Christ, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
never, 1

Faria, 1
gazed, 1
fondly, 1
on, 1
his, 1
noble-minded,, 1
single-hearted,, 1
high-principled, 1
young, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
read, 1
in, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
ample, 1
confirmation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sincerity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
devotion, 1
and, 1
the, 1
loyalty, 1
of, 1
his, 1
purpose., 1
"Thanks,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
invalid,, 1
extending, 1
one, 1
hand., 1
"I, 1

up, 1
the, 1

he, 1
might,, 1
by, 1

call, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
his, 1
officer, 1

the, 1

That, 1
would, 1
bring, 1
about, 1

would, 1

to, 1

Dantes, 1
took, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
in, 1
his,, 1

affectionately, 1
pressed, 1

Faria, 1
smiled, 1
encouragingly, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
his, 1
task,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
spirit, 1
of, 1
obedience, 1
and, 1
respect, 1

to, 1

Chapter, 1
18., 1
The, 1
Treasure., 1
When, 1
Dantes, 1
returned, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
in, 1
captivity,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
Faria, 1
seated, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
composed., 1
In, 1
the, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
which, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
narrow, 1
window, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell,, 1
he, 1
held, 1
open, 1
in, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
alone,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
recollected,, 1
he, 1
retained, 1
the, 1
use,, 1
a, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
paper,, 1
which,, 1
from, 1
being, 1
constantly, 1
rolled, 1
into, 1
a, 1
small, 1
compass,, 1
had, 1
the, 1
form, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cylinder,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
not, 1
easily, 1
kept, 1
open., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
showed, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
to, 1
Dantes., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
he, 1
inquired., 1
"Look, 1
at, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
it, 1
with, 1
all, 1
possible, 1
attention,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
only, 1
see, 1
a, 1
half-burnt, 1
paper,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
are, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
Gothic, 1
characters, 1
inscribed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
peculiar, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
ink.", 1
"This, 1
paper,, 1

may, 1
now, 1
avow, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

have, 1
the, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fidelity--this, 1

is, 1
my, 1
treasure,, 1
of, 1

from, 1

day, 1
forth,, 1

belongs, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
The, 1
sweat, 1
started, 1
forth, 1
on, 1
Dantes, 1
brow., 1
Until, 1
this, 1
day, 1
and, 1
for, 1
how, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time!--he, 1
had, 1
refrained, 1
from, 1
talking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
treasure,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
of, 1
madness., 1
With, 1
his, 1
instinctive, 1
delicacy, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
preferred, 1
avoiding, 1
any, 1
touch, 1
on, 1
this, 1
painful, 1
chord,, 1
and, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
been, 1
equally, 1
silent., 1
He, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
for, 1
a, 1
return, 1
to, 1
reason;, 1
and, 1
now, 1
these, 1
few, 1
words, 1
uttered, 1
by, 1
Faria,, 1
after, 1
so, 1
painful, 1
a, 1
crisis,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
indicate, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
relapse, 1
into, 1
mental, 1
alienation., 1
"Your, 1
treasure?", 1
stammered, 1
Dantes., 1
Faria, 1
smiled., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"You, 1
have,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
noble, 1
nature,, 1
Edmond,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
see, 1
by, 1
your, 1
paleness, 1
and, 1
agitation, 1
what, 1
is, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
your, 1
heart, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment., 1
No,, 1
be, 1
assured,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mad., 1
This, 1
treasure, 1
exists,, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
it,, 1
you, 1
will., 1
Yes--you., 1
No, 1
one, 1
would, 1
listen, 1
or, 1
believe, 1
me,, 1
because, 1
everyone, 1
thought, 1
me, 1
mad;, 1
but, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
must, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not,, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
believe, 1
me, 1
so, 1
afterwards, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will.", 1
"Alas,", 1
murmured, 1
Edmond, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
relapse!, 1
There, 1
was, 1
only, 1
this, 1
blow, 1
wanting.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
said, 1
aloud,, 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
friend,, 1
your, 1
attack, 1
has,, 1
perhaps,, 1
fatigued, 1
you;, 1
had, 1
you, 1
not, 1
better, 1
repose, 1
awhile?, 1
To-morrow,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
hear, 1
your, 1
narrative;, 1
but, 1
to-day, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
nurse, 1
you, 1
carefully., 1
Besides,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"a, 1
treasure, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
we, 1
need, 1
hurry, 1
about.", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
importance,, 1
Edmond!", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Who, 1
knows, 1
if, 1
to-morrow,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day, 1
after,, 1
the, 1
third, 1
attack, 1
may, 1
not, 1
come, 1
on?, 1
and, 1
then, 1
must, 1
not, 1
all, 1
be, 1
over?, 1
Yes,, 1
indeed,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
often, 1
thought, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
joy, 1
that, 1
these, 1
riches,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
make, 1
the, 1
wealth, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
families,, 1
will, 1
be, 1
forever, 1
lost, 1
to, 1
those, 1
men, 1
who, 1
persecute, 1
me., 1
This, 1
idea, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
vengeance, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
tasted, 1
it, 1
slowly, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
my, 1
dungeon, 1
and, 1
the, 1
despair, 1
of, 1
my, 1
captivity., 1
But, 1
now, 1
I, 1
have, 1
forgiven, 1
the, 1
world, 1
for, 1
the, 1
love, 1
of, 1
you;, 1
now, 1
that, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you,, 1
young, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
promising, 1
future,--now, 1
that, 1
I, 1
think, 1
of, 1
all, 1
that, 1
may, 1
result, 1
to, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
disclosure,, 1
I, 1
shudder, 1
at, 1
any, 1
delay,, 1
and, 1
tremble, 1
lest, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
assure, 1
to, 1
one, 1
as, 1
worthy, 1
as, 1
yourself, 1
the, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
so, 1
vast, 1
an, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
hidden, 1
wealth.", 1
Edmond, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh., 1
"You, 1
persist, 1
in, 1
your, 1
incredulity,, 1
Edmond,", 1
continued, 1
Faria., 1
"My, 1
words, 1
have, 1
not, 1
convinced, 1
you., 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
require, 1
proofs., 1
Well,, 1
then,, 1
read, 1
this, 1
paper,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
shown, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one.", 1
"To-morrow,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Edmond,, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
not, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
madness., 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
was, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
we, 1
should, 1

of, 1
that, 1
until, 1
to-morrow.", 1
"Then, 1
we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
it, 1
until, 1
to-morrow;, 1
but, 1
read, 1
this, 1
paper, 1
to-day.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
irritate, 1
him,", 1
thought, 1
Edmond,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
half, 1
was, 1
wanting,--having, 1
been, 1
burnt,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
by, 1
some, 1
accident,--he, 1
read:--, 1
"This, 1
treasure,, 1
which, 1
may, 1
amount, 1
to, 1
two..., 1
of, 1
Roman, 1
crowns, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
distant, 1
a..., 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1

declare, 1

to, 1
him, 1
alo..., 1
heir., 1
"25th, 1
April,, 1
149-", 1
"Well!", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
reading, 1
it., 1
"Why,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
broken, 1
lines, 1
and, 1
unconnected, 1
words,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
rendered, 1
illegible, 1
by, 1
fire.", 1
"Yes,, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
who, 1
read, 1
them, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time;, 1
but, 1
not, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
grown, 1
pale, 1
over, 1
them, 1
by, 1
many, 1
nights', 1
study,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
reconstructed, 1
every, 1
phrase,, 1
completed, 1
every, 1
thought.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
hidden, 1
meaning?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
judge, 1
for, 1
yourself;, 1
but, 1
first, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
this, 1
paper.", 1
"Silence!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes., 1
"Steps, 1
approach--I, 1
go--adieu.", 1
And, 1
Dantes,, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
history, 1
and, 1
explanation, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
confirm, 1
his, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
his, 1
friend's, 1
mental, 1
instability,, 1
glided, 1
like, 1
a, 1
snake, 1
along, 1
the, 1
narrow, 1
passage;, 1
while, 1
Faria,, 1
restored, 1
by, 1
his, 1
alarm, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
activity,, 1
pushed, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
into, 1
place, 1
with, 1
his, 1
foot,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mat, 1
in, 1
order, 1
the, 1
more, 1
effectually, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
discovery., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
who,, 1
hearing, 1
of, 1
Faria's, 1
illness, 1
from, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
had, 1
come, 1
in, 1
person, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him., 1
Faria, 1
sat, 1
up, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him,, 1
avoiding, 1
all, 1
gestures, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
conceal, 1
from, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
the, 1
paralysis, 1
that, 1
had, 1
already, 1
half, 1
stricken, 1
him, 1
with, 1
death., 1
His, 1
fear, 1
was, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
touched, 1
with, 1
pity,, 1
might, 1
order, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
removed, 1
to, 1
better, 1
quarters,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
separate, 1
him, 1
from, 1
his, 1
young, 1
companion., 1
But, 1
fortunately, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
left, 1
him,, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
madman,, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
affection,, 1
was, 1
only, 1
troubled, 1
with, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
indisposition., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
Edmond,, 1
seated, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
his, 1
scattered, 1
thoughts., 1
Faria,, 1
since, 1
their, 1
first, 1
acquaintance,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
on, 1
all, 1
points, 1
so, 1
rational, 1
and, 1
logical,, 1
so, 1
wonderfully, 1
sagacious,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
how, 1
so, 1
much, 1
wisdom, 1
on, 1
all, 1
points, 1
could, 1
be, 1
allied, 1
with, 1
madness., 1
Was, 1
Faria, 1
deceived, 1
as, 1
to, 1
his, 1
treasure,, 1
or, 1
was, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
deceived, 1
as, 1
to, 1
Faria?, 1
Dantes, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cell, 1
all, 1
day,, 1
not, 1
daring, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
thinking, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
defer, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
convinced,, 1
once, 1
for, 1
all,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
mad--such, 1
a, 1
conviction, 1
would, 1
be, 1
so, 1
terrible!, 1
But,, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
after, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
for, 1
the, 1
customary, 1
visit, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
by,, 1
Faria,, 1
not, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
appear,, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
move, 1
and, 1
get, 1
over, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
which, 1
separated, 1
them., 1
Edmond, 1
shuddered, 1
when, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
painful, 1
efforts, 1
which, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
made, 1
to, 1
drag, 1
himself, 1
along;, 1
his, 1
leg, 1
was, 1
inert,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
could, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
one, 1
arm., 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
assist, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
otherwise, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
by, 1
the, 1
small, 1
aperture, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
Dantes', 1
chamber., 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
pursuing, 1
you, 1
remorselessly,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
benignant, 1
smile., 1
"You, 1
thought, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
my, 1
munificence,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
Listen, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Edmond, 1
saw, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
escape,, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
he, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stool, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
the, 1
secretary, 1
and, 1
intimate, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
of, 1
the, 1
princes, 1
of, 1
that, 1
name., 1
I, 1
owe, 1
to, 1
this, 1
worthy, 1
lord, 1
all, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
knew., 1
He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
rich,, 1
although, 1
the, 1
wealth, 1
of, 1
his, 1
family, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
proverb,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
phrase, 1
very, 1
often,, 1
'As, 1
rich, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Spada.', 1
But, 1
he,, 1
like, 1
public, 1
rumor,, 1
lived, 1
on, 1
this, 1
reputation, 1
for, 1
wealth;, 1
his, 1
palace, 1
was, 1
my, 1
paradise., 1
I, 1
was, 1
tutor, 1
to, 1
his, 1
nephews,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
dead;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
I, 1
tried, 1
by, 1
absolute, 1
devotion, 1
to, 1
his, 1
will,, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him, 1
all, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
for, 1
me, 1
during, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
unremitting, 1
kindness., 1
The, 1
cardinal's, 1
house, 1
had, 1
no, 1
secrets, 1
for, 1
me., 1
I, 1
had, 1
often, 1
seen, 1
my, 1
noble, 1
patron, 1
annotating, 1
ancient, 1
volumes,, 1
and, 1
eagerly, 1
searching, 1
amongst, 1
dusty, 1
family, 1
manuscripts., 1
One, 1
day, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
reproaching, 1
him, 1
for, 1
his, 1
unavailing, 1
searches,, 1
and, 1
deploring, 1
the, 1
prostration, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
that, 1
followed, 1
them,, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
me,, 1
and,, 1
smiling, 1
bitterly,, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
volume, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
the, 1
History, 1
of, 1
the, 1
City, 1
of, 1
Rome., 1
There,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
twentieth, 1
chapter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Life, 1
of, 1
Pope, 1
Alexander, 1
VI.,, 1
were, 1
the, 1
following, 1
lines,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
can, 1
never, 1
forget:--, 1
"'The, 1
great, 1
wars, 1
of, 1
Romagna, 1
had, 1
ended;, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
completed, 1
his, 1
conquest,, 1
had, 1
need, 1
of, 1
money, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
all, 1
Italy., 1
The, 1
pope, 1
had, 1
also, 1
need, 1
of, 1
money, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
matters, 1
to, 1
an, 1
end, 1
with, 1
Louis, 1
XII., 1
King, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
formidable, 1
still, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
recent, 1
reverses;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
necessary,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
recourse, 1
to, 1
some, 1
profitable, 1
scheme,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
great, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
the, 1
impoverished, 1
condition, 1
of, 1
exhausted, 1
Italy., 1
His, 1
holiness, 1
had, 1
an, 1
idea., 1
He, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
make, 1
two, 1
cardinals.', 1
"By, 1
choosing, 1
two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
personages, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
especially, 1
rich, 1
men--this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
return, 1
the, 1
holy, 1
father, 1
looked, 1
for., 1
In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
sell, 1
the, 1
great, 1
appointments, 1
and, 1
splendid, 1
offices, 1
which, 1
the, 1
cardinals, 1
already, 1
held;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
two, 1
hats, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
besides., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
third, 1
point, 1
in, 1
view,, 1
which, 1
will, 1
appear, 1
hereafter., 1
The, 1
pope, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1
first, 1
found, 1
the, 1
two, 1
future, 1
cardinals;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
Giovanni, 1
Rospigliosi,, 1
who, 1
held, 1
four, 1
of, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
dignities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
See,, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Spada,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
noblest, 1
and, 1
richest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
nobility;, 1
both, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
high, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
favor, 1
from, 1
the, 1
pope., 1
They, 1
were, 1
ambitious,, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1
soon, 1
found, 1
purchasers, 1
for, 1
their, 1
appointments., 1
The, 1
result, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
Rospigliosi, 1
and, 1
Spada, 1
paid, 1
for, 1
being, 1
cardinals,, 1
and, 1
eight, 1
other, 1
persons, 1
paid, 1
for, 1
the, 1
offices, 1
the, 1
cardinals, 1
held, 1
before, 1
their, 1
elevation,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
eight, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
crowns, 1
entered, 1
into, 1
the, 1
coffers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
speculators., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
time, 1
now, 1
to, 1
proceed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
speculation., 1
The, 1
pope, 1
heaped, 1
attentions, 1
upon, 1
Rospigliosi, 1
and, 1
Spada,, 1
conferred, 1
upon, 1
them, 1
the, 1
insignia, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cardinalate,, 1
and, 1
induced, 1
them, 1
to, 1
arrange, 1
their, 1
affairs, 1
and, 1
take, 1
up, 1
their, 1
residence, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
pope, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1
invited, 1
the, 1
two, 1
cardinals, 1
to, 1
dinner., 1
This, 1
was, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
dispute, 1
between, 1
the, 1
holy, 1
father, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son., 1
Caesar, 1
thought, 1
they, 1
could, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
means, 1
which, 1
he, 1
always, 1
had, 1
ready, 1
for, 1
his, 1
friends,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
key, 1
which, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
certain, 1
persons, 1
with, 1
the, 1
request, 1
that, 1
they, 1
go, 1
and, 1
open, 1
a, 1
designated, 1
cupboard., 1
This, 1
key, 1
was, 1
furnished, 1
with, 1
a, 1
small, 1
iron, 1
point,--a, 1
negligence, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
locksmith., 1
When, 1
this, 1
was, 1
pressed, 1
to, 1
effect, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cupboard,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
lock, 1
was, 1
difficult,, 1
the, 1
person, 1
was, 1
pricked, 1
by, 1
this, 1
small, 1
point,, 1
and, 1
died, 1
next, 1
day., 1
Then, 1
there, 1
was, 1
the, 1
ring, 1
with, 1
the, 1
lion's, 1
head,, 1
which, 1
Caesar, 1
wore, 1
when, 1
he, 1
wanted, 1
to, 1
greet, 1
his, 1
friends, 1
with, 1
a, 1
clasp, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
lion, 1
bit, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
thus, 1
favored,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
twenty-four, 1
hours,, 1
the, 1
bite, 1
was, 1
mortal., 1
Caesar, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
should, 1
either, 1
ask, 1
the, 1
cardinals, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
cupboard,, 1
or, 1
shake, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
them;, 1
but, 1
Alexander, 1
VI.,, 1
replied:, 1
'Now, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
cardinals,, 1
Spada, 1
and, 1
Rospigliosi,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
ask, 1
both, 1
of, 1
them, 1
to, 1
dinner,, 1
something, 1
tells, 1
me, 1
that, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
get, 1
that, 1
money, 1
back., 1
Besides,, 1
you, 1
forget,, 1
Caesar,, 1
an, 1
indigestion, 1
declares, 1
itself, 1
immediately,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
prick, 1
or, 1
a, 1
bite, 1
occasions, 1
a, 1
delay, 1
of, 1
a, 1
day, 1
or, 1
two.', 1
Caesar, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
before, 1
such, 1
cogent, 1
reasoning,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
cardinals, 1
were, 1
consequently, 1
invited, 1
to, 1
dinner., 1
"The, 1
table, 1
was, 1
laid, 1
in, 1
a, 1
vineyard, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pope,, 1
near, 1
San, 1
Pierdarena,, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
retreat, 1
which, 1
the, 1
cardinals, 1
knew, 1
very, 1
well, 1
by, 1
report., 1
Rospigliosi,, 1
quite, 1
set, 1
up, 1
with, 1
his, 1
new, 1
dignities,, 1
went, 1
with, 1
a, 1
good, 1
appetite, 1
and, 1
his, 1
most, 1
ingratiating, 1
manner., 1
Spada,, 1
a, 1
prudent, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
greatly, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
his, 1
only, 1
nephew,, 1
a, 1
young, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
promise,, 1
took, 1
paper, 1
and, 1
pen,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
his, 1
will., 1
He, 1
then, 1
sent, 1
word, 1
to, 1
his, 1
nephew, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
him, 1
near, 1
the, 1
vineyard;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
did, 1
not, 1
find, 1
him., 1
"Spada, 1
knew, 1
what, 1
these, 1
invitations, 1
meant;, 1
since, 1
Christianity,, 1
so, 1
eminently, 1
civilizing,, 1
had, 1
made, 1
progress, 1
in, 1
Rome,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
a, 1
centurion, 1
who, 1
came, 1
from, 1
the, 1
tyrant, 1
with, 1
a, 1
message,, 1
'Caesar, 1
wills, 1
that, 1
you, 1
die.', 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
legate, 1
a, 1
latere,, 1
who, 1
came, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
to, 1
say, 1
from, 1
the, 1
pope,, 1
'His, 1
holiness, 1
requests, 1
you, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
with, 1
him.', 1
"Spada, 1
set, 1
out, 1
about, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1
to, 1
San, 1
Pierdarena., 1
The, 1
pope, 1
awaited, 1
him., 1
The, 1
first, 1
sight, 1
that, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Spada, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
nephew,, 1
in, 1
full, 1
costume,, 1
and, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1
paying, 1
him, 1
most, 1
marked, 1
attentions., 1
Spada, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
as, 1
Caesar, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
with, 1
an, 1
ironical, 1
air,, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
anticipated, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
snare, 1
was, 1
well, 1
spread., 1
They, 1
began, 1
dinner, 1
and, 1
Spada, 1
was, 1
only, 1
able, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
of, 1
his, 1
nephew, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
received, 1
his, 1
message., 1
The, 1
nephew, 1
replied, 1
no;, 1
perfectly, 1
comprehending, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
question., 1
It, 1
was, 1
too, 1
late,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
drunk, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
excellent, 1
wine,, 1
placed, 1
for, 1
him, 1
expressly, 1
by, 1
the, 1
pope's, 1
butler., 1
Spada, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
saw, 1
another, 1
bottle, 1
approach, 1
him,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
pressed, 1
to, 1
taste., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
a, 1
physician, 1
declared, 1
they, 1
were, 1
both, 1
poisoned, 1
through, 1
eating, 1
mushrooms., 1
Spada, 1
died, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vineyard;, 1
the, 1
nephew, 1
expired, 1
at, 1
his, 1
own, 1
door,, 1
making, 1
signs, 1
which, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
could, 1
not, 1
comprehend., 1
"Then, 1
Caesar, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pope, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
lay, 1
hands, 1
on, 1
the, 1
heritage,, 1
under, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
seeking, 1
for, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
man., 1
But, 1
the, 1
inheritance, 1
consisted, 1
in, 1
this, 1
only,, 1
a, 1
scrap, 1
of, 1
paper, 1
on, 1
which, 1
Spada, 1
had, 1
written:--'I, 1
bequeath, 1
to, 1
my, 1
beloved, 1
nephew, 1
my, 1
coffers,, 1
my, 1
books,, 1
and,, 1
amongst, 1
others,, 1
my, 1
breviary, 1
with, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
corners,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
he, 1
will, 1
preserve, 1
in, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
affectionate, 1
uncle.', 1
"The, 1
heirs, 1
sought, 1
everywhere,, 1
admired, 1
the, 1
breviary,, 1
laid, 1
hands, 1
on, 1
the, 1
furniture,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
greatly, 1
astonished, 1
that, 1
Spada,, 1
the, 1
rich, 1
man,, 1
was, 1
really, 1
the, 1
most, 1
miserable, 1
of, 1
uncles--no, 1
treasures--unless, 1
they, 1
were, 1
those, 1
of, 1
science,, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
library, 1
and, 1
laboratories., 1
That, 1
was, 1
all., 1
Caesar, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father, 1
searched,, 1
examined,, 1
scrutinized,, 1
but, 1
found, 1
nothing,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
very, 1
little;, 1
not, 1
exceeding, 1
a, 1
few, 1
thousand, 1
crowns, 1
in, 1
plate,, 1
and, 1
about, 1
the, 1
same, 1
in, 1
ready, 1
money;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
nephew, 1
had, 1
time, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
before, 1
he, 1
expired:, 1
'Look, 1
well, 1
among, 1
my, 1
uncle's, 1
papers;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
will.', 1
"They, 1
sought, 1
even, 1
more, 1
thoroughly, 1
than, 1
the, 1
august, 1
heirs, 1
had, 1
done,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fruitless., 1
There, 1
were, 1
two, 1
palaces, 1
and, 1
a, 1
vineyard, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
Palatine, 1
Hill;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
these, 1
days, 1
landed, 1
property, 1
had, 1
not, 1
much, 1
value,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
palaces, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vineyard, 1
remained, 1
to, 1
the, 1
family, 1
since, 1
they, 1
were, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
rapacity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pope, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son., 1
Months, 1
and, 1
years, 1
rolled, 1
on., 1
Alexander, 1
VI., 1
died,, 1
poisoned,--you, 1
know, 1
by, 1
what, 1
mistake., 1
Caesar,, 1
poisoned, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
escaped, 1
by, 1
shedding, 1
his, 1
skin, 1
like, 1
a, 1
snake;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
new, 1
skin, 1
was, 1
spotted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
till, 1
it, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
a, 1
tiger's., 1
Then,, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
Rome,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
and, 1
got, 1
himself, 1
obscurely, 1
killed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
night, 1
skirmish,, 1
scarcely, 1
noticed, 1
in, 1
history., 1
After, 1
the, 1
pope's, 1
death, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son's, 1
exile,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
supposed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Spada, 1
family, 1
would, 1
resume, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
position, 1
they, 1
had, 1
held, 1
before, 1
the, 1
cardinal's, 1
time;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
case., 1
The, 1
Spadas, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
doubtful, 1
ease,, 1
a, 1
mystery, 1
hung, 1
over, 1
this, 1
dark, 1
affair,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
public, 1
rumor, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
Caesar,, 1
a, 1
better, 1
politician, 1
than, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
from, 1
the, 1
pope, 1
the, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
cardinals., 1
I, 1
say, 1
the, 1
two,, 1
because, 1
Cardinal, 1
Rospigliosi,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
any, 1
precaution,, 1
was, 1
completely, 1
despoiled., 1
"Up, 1
to, 1
this, 1
point,", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
interrupting, 1
the, 1
thread, 1
of, 1
his, 1
narrative,, 1
"this, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
you, 1
very, 1
meaningless,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
eh?", 1
"Oh,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
cried, 1
Dantes,, 1
"on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
as, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
reading, 1
a, 1
most, 1
interesting, 1
narrative;, 1
go, 1
on,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
will.", 1
"The, 1
family, 1
began, 1
to, 1
get, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
their, 1
obscurity., 1
Years, 1
rolled, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
descendants, 1
some, 1
were, 1
soldiers,, 1
others, 1
diplomatists;, 1
some, 1
churchmen,, 1
some, 1
bankers;, 1
some, 1
grew, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
were, 1
ruined., 1
I, 1
come, 1
now, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
whose, 1
secretary, 1
I, 1
was--the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Spada., 1
I, 1
had, 1
often, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
complain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disproportion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
rank, 1
with, 1
his, 1
fortune;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
advised, 1
him, 1
to, 1
invest, 1
all, 1
he, 1
had, 1
in, 1
an, 1
annuity., 1
He, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
doubled, 1
his, 1
income., 1
The, 1
celebrated, 1
breviary, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
possession., 1
It, 1
had, 1
been, 1
handed, 1
down, 1
from, 1
father, 1
to, 1
son;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
clause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
only, 1
will, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
found,, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
regarded, 1
as, 1
a, 1
genuine, 1
relic,, 1
preserved, 1
in, 1
the, 1
family, 1
with, 1
superstitious, 1
veneration., 1
It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
illuminated, 1
book,, 1
with, 1
beautiful, 1
Gothic, 1
characters,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
weighty, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
always, 1
carried, 1
it, 1
before, 1
the, 1
cardinal, 1

days, 1
of, 1
great, 1
solemnity., 1
"At, 1
the, 1

descending, 1
from, 1

in, 1
my, 1
turn, 1

immense, 1
bundles, 1
of, 1
documents,, 1

me;, 1

in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
exhaustive, 1
researches,, 1
I, 1
found--nothing., 1
Yet, 1
I, 1
had, 1
read,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
even, 1
written, 1
a, 1
precise, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Borgia, 1

the, 1

could, 1
only, 1
trace, 1
the, 1
acquisition, 1
of, 1
the, 1
property, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cardinal, 1
Rospigliosi,, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
in, 1
misfortune., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
then, 1
almost, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inheritance, 1
had, 1
neither, 1
profited, 1

had, 1

had, 1
reserved, 1
from, 1
his, 1
annuity, 1

papers,, 1
his, 1
library,, 1
composed, 1
of, 1
five, 1
thousand, 1
volumes,, 1

his, 1
famous, 1
breviary., 1

these, 1
he, 1
bequeathed, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
Roman, 1
crowns,, 1

he, 1
had, 1

conclusion., 1

1807,, 1

was, 1
arrested,, 1

a, 1
fortnight, 1

will, 1
see, 1
presently, 1
how, 1
the, 1
date, 1
became, 1
fixed, 1
in, 1
my, 1
memory),, 1
I, 1
was, 1
reading,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
thousandth, 1
time,, 1
the, 1

was, 1
arranging,, 1
for, 1

to, 1
leave, 1

settle, 1
at, 1
Florence,, 1

twelve, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1

possessed,, 1
my, 1

the, 1
famous, 1
breviary,, 1
when,, 1
tired, 1
with, 1
my, 1
constant, 1
labor, 1
at, 1
the, 1

thing,, 1
and, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
dinner, 1
I, 1
had, 1
eaten,, 1
my, 1
head, 1
dropped, 1
on, 1
my, 1
hands,, 1

I, 1
fell, 1
asleep, 1
about, 1
three, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
afternoon., 1
I, 1
awoke, 1
as, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
was, 1
striking, 1
six., 1
I, 1
raised, 1
my, 1
head;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
darkness., 1
I, 1
rang, 1
for, 1
a, 1
light,, 1

as, 1
no, 1
one, 1
came,, 1
I, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
find, 1
one, 1
for, 1
myself., 1
It, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
but, 1
anticipating, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
manners, 1
which, 1
I, 1
should, 1
soon, 1
be, 1
under, 1
the, 1
necessity, 1
of, 1

in, 1
these, 1
days, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friends;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
Dantes', 1
countenance, 1
became, 1
gloomy,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
oath, 1
of, 1
vengeance, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
recurred, 1
to, 1
his, 1
memory,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
reflected, 1
how, 1
much, 1
ill,, 1
in, 1
these, 1
times,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
with, 1
thirteen, 1
or, 1
fourteen, 1
millions, 1
could, 1
do, 1
to, 1
his, 1
enemies., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
but, 1
Dantes, 1
knew, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
often, 1
passed, 1
it,, 1
situated, 1
twenty-five, 1
miles, 1
from, 1
Pianosa,, 1
between, 1
Corsica, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
once, 1
touched, 1
there., 1
This, 1
island, 1
was,, 1
always, 1
had, 1
been,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
is,, 1
completely, 1
deserted., 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
rock, 1
of, 1
almost, 1
conical, 1
form,, 1
which, 1
looks, 1
as, 1
though, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
thrust, 1
up, 1
by, 1
volcanic, 1
force, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean., 1
Dantes, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island, 1
for, 1
Faria,, 1
and, 1
Faria, 1
gave, 1
Dantes, 1
advice, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
means, 1
he, 1
should, 1
employ, 1
to, 1
recover, 1
the, 1
treasure., 1
But, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
far, 1
from, 1
being, 1
as, 1
enthusiastic, 1
and, 1
confident, 1
as, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
It, 1
was, 1
past, 1
a, 1
question, 1
now, 1
that, 1
Faria, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
lunatic,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
way, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
achieved, 1
the, 1
discovery,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
given, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
the, 1
suspicion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
madness,, 1
increased, 1
Edmond's, 1
admiration, 1
of, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
the, 1
deposit,, 1
supposing, 1
it, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
existed,, 1
still, 1
existed;, 1
and, 1
though, 1
he, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
treasure, 1
as, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
chimerical,, 1
he, 1
yet, 1
believed, 1
it, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
there., 1
However,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
fate, 1
resolved, 1
on, 1
depriving, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
of, 1
their, 1
last, 1
chance,, 1
and, 1
making, 1
them, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
perpetual, 1
imprisonment,, 1
a, 1
new, 1
misfortune, 1
befell, 1
them;, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
side,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
long, 1
been, 1
in, 1
ruins,, 1
was, 1
rebuilt., 1
They, 1
had, 1
repaired, 1
it, 1
completely,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
up, 1
with, 1
vast, 1
masses, 1
of, 1
stone, 1
the, 1
hole, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
partly, 1
filled, 1
in., 1
But, 1
for, 1
this, 1
precaution,, 1
which,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
remembered,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
made, 1
to, 1
Edmond,, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
still, 1
greater,, 1
for, 1
their, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
detected,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
would, 1
undoubtedly, 1
have, 1
been, 1
separated., 1
Thus, 1
a, 1
new,, 1
a, 1
stronger,, 1
and, 1
more, 1
inexorable, 1
barrier, 1
was, 1
interposed, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
off, 1
the, 1
realization, 1
of, 1
their, 1
hopes., 1
"You, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
sorrowful, 1
resignation,, 1
to, 1
Faria,, 1
"that, 1
God, 1
deems, 1
it, 1
right, 1
to, 1
take, 1
from, 1
me, 1
any, 1
claim, 1
to, 1
merit, 1
for, 1
what, 1
you, 1
call, 1
my, 1
devotion, 1
to, 1
you., 1
I, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
forever, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
break, 1
my, 1
promise, 1
if, 1
I, 1
would., 1
The, 1
treasure, 1
will, 1
be, 1
no, 1
more, 1
mine, 1
than, 1
yours,, 1
and, 1
neither, 1
of, 1
us, 1
will, 1
quit, 1
this, 1
prison., 1
But, 1
my, 1
real, 1
treasure, 1
is, 1
not, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,, 1
which, 1
awaits, 1
me, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
sombre, 1
rocks, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
your, 1
presence,, 1
our, 1
living, 1
together, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
hours, 1
a, 1
day,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
our, 1
jailers;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
intelligence, 1
you, 1
have, 1
elicited, 1
from, 1
my, 1
brain,, 1
the, 1
languages, 1
you, 1
have, 1
implanted, 1
in, 1
my, 1
memory,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
root, 1
there, 1
with, 1
all, 1
their, 1
philological, 1
ramifications., 1
These, 1
different, 1
sciences, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
made, 1
so, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
me, 1
by, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
you, 1
possess, 1
of, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
clearness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
principles, 1
to, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
reduced, 1
them--this, 1
is, 1
my, 1
treasure,, 1
my, 1
beloved, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
this, 1
you, 1
have, 1
made, 1
me, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
happy., 1
Believe, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
take, 1
comfort,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
better, 1
for, 1
me, 1
than, 1
tons, 1
of, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
cases, 1
of, 1
diamonds,, 1
even, 1
were, 1
they, 1
not, 1
as, 1
problematical, 1
as, 1
the, 1
clouds, 1
we, 1
see, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
floating, 1
over, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
take, 1
for, 1
terra, 1
firma,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
evaporate, 1
and, 1
vanish, 1
as, 1
we, 1
draw, 1
near, 1
to, 1
them., 1
To, 1
have, 1
you, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
near, 1
me,, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
your, 1
eloquent, 1
speech,--which, 1
embellishes, 1
my, 1
mind,, 1
strengthens, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
and, 1
makes, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
frame, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
great, 1
and, 1
terrible, 1
things,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
should, 1
ever, 1
be, 1
free,--so, 1
fills, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
existence,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
despair, 1
to, 1
which, 1
I, 1
was, 1
just, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
yielding, 1
when, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
you,, 1
has, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
hold, 1
over, 1
me;, 1
and, 1
this--this, 1
is, 1
my, 1
fortune--not, 1
chimerical,, 1
but, 1
actual., 1
I, 1
owe, 1
you, 1
my, 1
real, 1
good,, 1
my, 1
present, 1
happiness;, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
sovereigns, 1
of, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
even, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia, 1
himself,, 1
could, 1
not, 1
deprive, 1
me, 1
of, 1
this.", 1
Thus,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
actually, 1
happy,, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
days, 1
these, 1
two, 1
unfortunates, 1
passed, 1
together, 1
went, 1
quickly., 1
Faria,, 1
who, 1
for, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
silence, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
treasure,, 1
now, 1
perpetually, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
it., 1
As, 1
he, 1
had, 1
prophesied, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
paralyzed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
right, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
the, 1
left, 1
leg,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
given, 1
up, 1
all, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
ever, 1
enjoying, 1
it, 1
himself., 1
But, 1
he, 1
was, 1
continually, 1
thinking, 1
over, 1
some, 1
means, 1
of, 1
escape, 1
for, 1
his, 1
young, 1
companion,, 1
and, 1
anticipating, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
he, 1
would, 1
enjoy., 1
For, 1
fear, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
might, 1
be, 1
some, 1
day, 1
lost, 1
or, 1
stolen,, 1
he, 1
compelled, 1
Dantes, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
it, 1
by, 1
heart;, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
knew, 1
it, 1
from, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
word., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
destroyed, 1
the, 1
second, 1
portion,, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
if, 1
the, 1
first, 1
were, 1
seized,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
would, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
its, 1
real, 1
meaning., 1
Whole, 1
hours, 1
sometimes, 1
passed, 1
while, 1
Faria, 1
was, 1
giving, 1
instructions, 1
to, 1
Dantes,--instructions, 1
which, 1
were, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
liberty., 1
Then,, 1
once, 1
free,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
day, 1
and, 1
hour, 1
and, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
so,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
only, 1
thought,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
by, 1
some, 1
means,, 1
and, 1
remain, 1
there, 1
alone, 1
under, 1
some, 1
pretext, 1
which, 1
would, 1
arouse, 1
no, 1
suspicions;, 1
and, 1
once, 1
there,, 1
to, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
wonderful, 1
caverns,, 1
and, 1
search, 1
in, 1
the, 1
appointed, 1
spot,--the, 1
appointed, 1
spot,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
remembered,, 1
being, 1
the, 1
farthest, 1
angle, 1
in, 1
the, 1
second, 1
opening., 1
In, 1
the, 1
meanwhile, 1
the, 1
hours, 1
passed,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
rapidly,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
tolerably., 1
Faria,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
without, 1
having, 1
recovered, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
foot,, 1
had, 1
regained, 1
all, 1
the, 1
clearness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
understanding,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
gradually,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
moral, 1
instructions, 1
we, 1
have, 1
detailed,, 1
taught, 1
his, 1
youthful, 1
companion, 1
the, 1
patient, 1
and, 1
sublime, 1
duty, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prisoner,, 1
who, 1
learns, 1
to, 1
make, 1
something, 1
from, 1
nothing., 1
They, 1
were, 1
thus, 1
perpetually, 1
employed,--Faria,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
see, 1
himself, 1
grow, 1
old;, 1
Dantes,, 1
for, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
recalling, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
extinct, 1
past, 1
which, 1
now, 1
only, 1
floated, 1
in, 1
his, 1
memory, 1
like, 1
a, 1
distant, 1
light, 1
wandering, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night., 1
So, 1
life, 1
went, 1
on, 1
for, 1
them, 1
as, 1
it, 1
does, 1
for, 1
those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
not, 1
victims, 1
of, 1
misfortune, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
activities, 1
glide, 1
along, 1
mechanically, 1
and, 1
tranquilly, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
providence., 1
But, 1
beneath, 1
this, 1
superficial, 1
calm, 1
there, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
perhaps, 1
in, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
many, 1
repressed, 1
desires,, 1
many, 1
stifled, 1
sighs,, 1
which, 1
found, 1
vent, 1
when, 1
Faria, 1
was, 1
left, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
Edmond, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
One, 1
night, 1
Edmond, 1
awoke, 1
suddenly,, 1
believing, 1
that, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
some, 1
one, 1
calling, 1
him., 1
He, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
utter, 1
darkness., 1
His, 1
name,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
plaintive, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
essayed, 1
to, 1
pronounce, 1
his, 1
name,, 1
reached, 1
him., 1
He, 1
sat, 1
up, 1
in, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
sweat, 1
broke, 1
out, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
Undoubtedly, 1
the, 1
call, 1
came, 1
from, 1
Faria's, 1
dungeon., 1
"Alas,", 1
murmured, 1
Edmond;, 1
"can, 1
it, 1
be?", 1
He, 1
moved, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
drew, 1
up, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
and, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
extremity;, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
entrance, 1
was, 1
open., 1
By, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
and, 1
wavering, 1
lamp,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
spoken,, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
pale,, 1
but, 1
yet, 1
erect,, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bedstead., 1
His, 1
features, 1
were, 1
writhing, 1
with, 1
those, 1
horrible, 1
symptoms, 1
which, 1
he, 1
already, 1
knew,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
so, 1
seriously, 1
alarmed, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
them, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time., 1
"Alas,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Faria, 1
in, 1
a, 1
resigned, 1
tone,, 1
"you, 1
understand,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
Edmond, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
agony,, 1
and,, 1
quite, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
exclaiming,, 1
"Help,, 1
help!", 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
just, 1
sufficient, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
him., 1
"Silence,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"or, 1
you, 1
are, 1
lost., 1
We, 1
must, 1
now, 1
only, 1
think, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
act, 1
as, 1
to, 1
render, 1
your, 1
captivity, 1
supportable, 1
or, 1
your, 1
flight, 1
possible., 1
It, 1
would, 1
require, 1
years, 1
to, 1
do, 1
again, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
results, 1
would, 1
be, 1
instantly, 1
destroyed, 1
if, 1
our, 1
jailers, 1
knew, 1
we, 1
had, 1
communicated, 1
with, 1
each, 1

Besides,, 1

assured,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Edmond,, 1
the, 1
dungeon, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
will, 1
not, 1
long, 1
remain, 1
empty;, 1
some, 1
other, 1
unfortunate, 1
being, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
take, 1
my, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
him, 1
you, 1
will, 1
appear, 1
like, 1
an, 1
angel, 1
of, 1
salvation., 1
Perhaps, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
young,, 1
strong,, 1
and, 1
enduring,, 1
like, 1
yourself,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
aid, 1
you, 1
in, 1
your, 1
escape,, 1
while, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
but, 1
a, 1
hindrance., 1
You, 1
will, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
have, 1
half, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
body, 1
tied, 1
to, 1
you, 1
as, 1
a, 1
drag, 1
to, 1
all, 1
your, 1
movements., 1
At, 1
length, 1
providence, 1
has, 1
done, 1
something, 1
for, 1
you;, 1
he, 1
restores, 1
to, 1
you, 1
more, 1
than, 1
he, 1
takes, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
time, 1
I, 1
should, 1
die.", 1
Edmond, 1
could, 1
only, 1
clasp, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
exclaim,, 1
"Oh,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
speak, 1
not, 1
thus!", 1
and, 1
then, 1
resuming, 1
all, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
mind,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
staggered, 1
under, 1
this, 1
blow,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
strength,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
you, 1
once,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
save, 1
you, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time!", 1
And, 1
raising, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
the, 1
phial,, 1
still, 1
a, 1
third, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
red, 1
liquor., 1
"See,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"there, 1
remains, 1
still, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magic, 1
draught., 1
Quick,, 1
quick!, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1

"There, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
hope,", 1
replied, 1
Faria,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
"but, 1
no, 1
matter;, 1

wills, 1

that, 1
man, 1

has, 1

profoundly, 1
rooted, 1
the, 1
love, 1
of, 1

however, 1
painful, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be,, 1

"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
will, 1
save, 1
you, 1

"Well,, 1
then,, 1
try., 1
The, 1
cold, 1
gains, 1
upon, 1
me., 1
I, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
flowing, 1
towards, 1
my, 1
brain., 1
These, 1
horrible, 1
chills,, 1
which, 1
make, 1
my, 1
teeth, 1
chatter, 1
and, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
dislocate, 1
my, 1
bones,, 1

to, 1
pervade, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
frame;, 1
in, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
malady, 1
will, 1
reach, 1
its, 1
height,, 1

in, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1

will, 1

nothing, 1

of, 1
me, 1

a, 1
corpse.", 1
"Oh!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes,, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
wrung, 1
with, 1
anguish., 1
"Do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
did, 1
before,, 1
only, 1
do, 1
not, 1

so, 1
long,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
springs, 1
of, 1
life, 1

now, 1
exhausted, 1
in, 1
me,, 1

he, 1
continued,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
his, 1
paralyzed, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
leg,, 1
"has, 1

half, 1
its, 1
work, 1

made, 1
me, 1

twelve, 1

down, 1

lift, 1
me, 1
on, 1
my, 1
bed,, 1

myself.", 1
Edmond, 1
took, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
laid, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Faria,, 1
"sole, 1
consolation, 1
of, 1
my, 1
wretched, 1
existence,--you, 1
whom, 1
heaven, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
somewhat, 1
late,, 1

still, 1

me,, 1

thee!", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
cast, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
leaning, 1
his, 1
head, 1
against, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
bed., 1
"Listen,, 1
now,, 1
to, 1
what, 1

in, 1
this, 1
my, 1
dying, 1
moment., 1

treasure, 1
of, 1

boon, 1
of, 1

space., 1

it, 1
in, 1
the, 1

the, 1
inmost, 1

yourself, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fortune--for, 1

indeed, 1

long, 1
enough.", 1
A, 1
violent, 1
convulsion, 1
attacked, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
Dantes, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Faria's, 1
eyes, 1
injected, 1
with, 1
blood., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
a, 1
flow, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
had, 1
ascended, 1
from, 1
the, 1
chest, 1
to, 1
the, 1
head., 1
"Adieu,, 1
adieu!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
clasping, 1
Edmond's, 1
hand, 1
convulsively--"adieu!", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,--no,, 1
not, 1
yet,", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
forsake, 1
me!, 1
Oh,, 1
succor, 1
him!, 1
Help--help--help!", 1
"Hush--hush!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man,, 1
"that, 1
they, 1
may, 1
not, 1
separate, 1
us, 1

"You, 1
are, 1
right., 1
Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes;, 1
be, 1
assured, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
save, 1
you!, 1
Besides,, 1
although, 1
you, 1
suffer, 1
much,, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
such, 1
agony, 1
as, 1
you, 1
were, 1
before.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
mistake., 1
I, 1
suffer, 1
less, 1
because, 1
there, 1
is, 1
in, 1
me, 1
less, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
endure., 1
At, 1
your, 1
age, 1
we, 1
have, 1
faith, 1
in, 1
life;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
privilege, 1
of, 1
youth, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
and, 1
hope,, 1
but, 1
old, 1
men, 1
see, 1
death, 1
more, 1
clearly., 1
Oh,, 1
'tis, 1
here--'tis, 1
here--'tis, 1
over--my, 1
sight, 1
is, 1
gone--my, 1
senses, 1
fail!, 1
Your, 1
hand,, 1
Dantes!, 1
Adieu--adieu!", 1
And, 1
raising, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
a, 1
final, 1
effort,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
summoned, 1
all, 1
his, 1
faculties,, 1
he, 1
said,--"Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
forget, 1
not, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo!", 1
And, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
The, 1
crisis, 1
was, 1
terrible,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
rigid, 1
form, 1
with, 1
twisted, 1
limbs,, 1
swollen, 1
eyelids,, 1
and, 1
lips, 1
flecked, 1
with, 1
bloody, 1
foam,, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
torture,, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
intellectual, 1
being, 1
who, 1
so, 1
lately, 1
rested, 1
there., 1
Dantes, 1
took, 1
the, 1
lamp,, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
a, 1
projecting, 1
stone, 1
above, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
whence, 1
its, 1
tremulous, 1
light, 1
fell, 1
with, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
fantastic, 1
ray, 1
on, 1
the, 1
distorted, 1
countenance, 1
and, 1
motionless,, 1
stiffened, 1
body., 1
With, 1
steady, 1
gaze, 1
he, 1
awaited, 1
confidently, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
administering, 1
the, 1
restorative., 1
When, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
right, 1
moment, 1
had, 1
arrived,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
the, 1
knife,, 1
pried, 1
open, 1
the, 1
teeth,, 1
which, 1
offered, 1
less, 1
resistance, 1
than, 1
before,, 1
counted, 1
one, 1
after, 1
the, 1
other, 1
twelve, 1
drops,, 1
and, 1
watched;, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
contained,, 1
perhaps,, 1
twice, 1
as, 1
much, 1
more., 1
He, 1
waited, 1
ten, 1
minutes,, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,--no, 1
change, 1
took, 1
place., 1
Trembling,, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
erect,, 1
his, 1
brow, 1
bathed, 1
with, 1
perspiration,, 1
he, 1
counted, 1
the, 1
seconds, 1
by, 1
the, 1
beating, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
was, 1
time, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
last, 1
trial,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
put, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
to, 1
the, 1
purple, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
Faria,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
having, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
force, 1
open, 1
his, 1
jaws,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
extended,, 1
he, 1
poured, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
liquid, 1
down, 1
his, 1
throat., 1
The, 1
draught, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
galvanic, 1
effect,, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
trembling, 1
pervaded, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
limbs,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
opened, 1
until, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fearful, 1
to, 1
gaze, 1
upon, 1
them,, 1
he, 1
heaved, 1
a, 1
sigh, 1
which, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
shriek,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
his, 1
convulsed, 1
body, 1
returned, 1
gradually, 1
to, 1
its, 1
former, 1
immobility,, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
remaining, 1
open., 1
Half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
elapsed,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
this, 1
period, 1
of, 1
anguish,, 1
Edmond, 1
leaned, 1
over, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
body, 1
gradually, 1
grow, 1
cold,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
heart's, 1
pulsation, 1
become, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
deep, 1
and, 1
dull,, 1
until, 1
at, 1
length, 1
it, 1
stopped;, 1
the, 1
last, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
ceased,, 1
the, 1
face, 1
became, 1
livid,, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
remained, 1
open,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
eyeballs, 1
were, 1
glazed., 1
It, 1
was, 1
six, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
the, 1
dawn, 1
was, 1
just, 1
breaking,, 1
and, 1
its, 1
feeble, 1
ray, 1
came, 1
into, 1
the, 1
dungeon,, 1
and, 1
paled, 1
the, 1
ineffectual, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamp., 1
Strange, 1
shadows, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
times, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
life., 1
While, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
between, 1
day, 1
and, 1
night, 1
lasted,, 1
Dantes, 1
still, 1
doubted;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
the, 1
daylight, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
pre-eminence,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
a, 1
corpse., 1
Then, 1
an, 1
invincible, 1
and, 1
extreme, 1
terror, 1
seized, 1
upon, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
dared, 1
not, 1
again, 1
press, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
that, 1
hung, 1
out, 1
of, 1
bed,, 1
he, 1
dared, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
to, 1
gaze, 1
on, 1
those, 1
fixed, 1
and, 1
vacant, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
tried, 1
many, 1
times, 1
to, 1
close,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
vain--they, 1
opened, 1
again, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
shut., 1
He, 1
extinguished, 1
the, 1
lamp,, 1
carefully, 1
concealed, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
closing, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
passage, 1
by, 1
the, 1
large, 1
stone, 1
as, 1
he, 1
descended., 1
It, 1
was, 1
time,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
was, 1
coming., 1
On, 1
this, 1
occasion, 1
he, 1
began, 1
his, 1
rounds, 1
at, 1
Dantes', 1
cell,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
leaving, 1
him, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
to, 1
Faria's, 1
dungeon,, 1
taking, 1
thither, 1
breakfast, 1
and, 1
some, 1
linen., 1
Nothing, 1
betokened, 1
that, 1
the, 1
man, 1
knew, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
what, 1
had, 1
occurred., 1
He, 1
went, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
then, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
an, 1
indescribable, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dungeon, 1
of, 1
his, 1
unfortunate, 1
friend., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
returned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
subterraneous, 1
gallery,, 1
and, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
time, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
exclamations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
turnkey,, 1
who, 1
called, 1
out, 1
for, 1
help., 1
Other, 1
turnkeys, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
regular, 1
tramp, 1
of, 1
soldiers., 1
Last, 1
of, 1
all, 1
came, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
Edmond, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
as, 1
they, 1
moved, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
who, 1
asked, 1
them, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
water, 1
on, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
man's, 1
face;, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
this, 1
application,, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
did, 1
not, 1
recover,, 1
they, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
The, 1
governor, 1
then, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
words, 1
of, 1
pity, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
Dantes', 1
listening, 1
ears,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
brutal, 1
laughter., 1
"Well,, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
one,, 1
"the, 1
madman, 1
has, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
look, 1
after, 1
his, 1
treasure., 1
Good, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
him!", 1
"With, 1
all, 1
his, 1
millions,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
have, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
his, 1
shroud!", 1
said, 1
another., 1
"Oh,", 1
added, 1
a, 1
third, 1
voice,, 1
"the, 1
shrouds, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
are, 1
not, 1
dear!", 1
"Perhaps,", 1
said, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
speakers,, 1
"as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
churchman,, 1
they, 1
may, 1
go, 1
to, 1
some, 1
expense, 1
in, 1
his, 1
behalf.", 1
"They, 1
may, 1
give, 1
him, 1
the, 1
honors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sack.", 1
Edmond, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
but, 1
comprehended, 1
very, 1
little, 1
of, 1
what, 1
was, 1
said., 1
The, 1
voices, 1
soon, 1
ceased,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
every, 1
one, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
cell., 1
Still, 1
he, 1
dared, 1
not, 1
to, 1
enter,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
might, 1
have, 1
left, 1
some, 1
turnkey, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
the, 1
dead., 1
He, 1
remained,, 1
therefore,, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
motionless,, 1
hardly, 1
venturing, 1
to, 1
breathe., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
noise,, 1
which, 1
increased., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
who, 1
returned,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
other, 1
attendants., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,--it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
was, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
body., 1
The, 1
inquiries, 1
soon, 1
commenced., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
analyzed, 1
the, 1
symptoms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
malady, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
had, 1
succumbed,, 1
and, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
Questions, 1
and, 1
answers, 1
followed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
nonchalant, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
made, 1
Dantes, 1
indignant,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
should, 1
have, 1
for, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
abbe, 1
a, 1
love, 1
and, 1
respect, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
sorry, 1
for, 1
what, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
replying, 1
to, 1
the, 1
assurance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
is, 1
really, 1
dead;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
quiet,, 1
inoffensive, 1
prisoner,, 1
happy, 1
in, 1
his, 1
folly,, 1
and, 1
required, 1
no, 1
watching.", 1
"Ah,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
turnkey,, 1
"there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
for, 1
watching, 1
him:, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
stayed, 1
here, 1
fifty, 1
years,, 1
I'll, 1
answer, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
escape.", 1
"Still,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
requisite,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
your, 1
certainty,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
that, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
your, 1
science,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
discharge, 1
of, 1
my, 1
official, 1
duty,, 1
that, 1
we, 1
should, 1
be, 1
perfectly, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
is, 1
dead.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
complete, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Dantes,, 1
still, 1
listening,, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
was, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time., 1
"You, 1
may, 1
make, 1
your, 1
mind, 1
easy,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
dead., 1
I, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
for, 1
that.", 1
"You, 1
know,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
persisting,, 1
"that, 1
we, 1
are, 1
not, 1
content, 1
in, 1
such, 1
cases, 1
as, 1
this, 1
with, 1
such, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
examination., 1
In, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
appearances,, 1
be, 1
so, 1
kind,, 1
therefore,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
your, 1
duty, 1
by, 1
fulfilling, 1
the, 1
formalities, 1
described, 1
by, 1
law.", 1
"Let, 1
the, 1
irons, 1
be, 1
heated,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"but, 1
really, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
useless, 1
precaution.", 1
This, 1
order, 1
to, 1
heat, 1
the, 1
irons, 1
made, 1
Dantes, 1
shudder., 1
He, 1
heard, 1
hasty, 1
steps,, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
a, 1
door,, 1
people, 1
going, 1
and, 1
coming,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
a, 1
turnkey, 1
entered,, 1
saying,--, 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
brazier,, 1
lighted.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
crackling, 1
of, 1
burning, 1
flesh,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
peculiar, 1
and, 1
nauseous, 1
smell, 1
penetrated, 1
even, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
where, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
listening, 1
in, 1
horror., 1
The, 1
perspiration, 1
poured, 1
forth, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
should, 1
faint., 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
really, 1
dead,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"this, 1
burn, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heel, 1
is, 1
decisive., 1
The, 1
poor, 1
fool, 1
is, 1
cured, 1
of, 1
his, 1
folly,, 1
and, 1
delivered, 1
from, 1
his, 1
captivity.", 1
"Wasn't, 1
his, 1
name, 1
Faria?", 1
inquired, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
officers, 1
who, 1
accompanied, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
ancient, 1
name., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
too,, 1
very, 1
learned,, 1
and, 1
rational, 1
enough, 1
on, 1
all, 1
points, 1
which, 1
did, 1
not, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
his, 1
treasure;, 1
but, 1
on, 1
that,, 1
indeed,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
intractable.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
malady, 1
which, 1
we, 1
call, 1
monomania,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"You, 1
had, 1
never, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
complain, 1
of?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
who, 1
had, 1
charge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Never,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
"never;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
sometimes, 1
amused, 1
me, 1
very, 1
much, 1
by, 1
telling, 1
me, 1
stories., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
too,, 1
when, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
was, 1
ill,, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
prescription, 1
which, 1
cured, 1
her.", 1
"Ah,, 1
ah!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
rival;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
hope,, 1
governor,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
show, 1
him, 1
all, 1
proper, 1
respect.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
make, 1
your, 1
mind, 1
easy,, 1
he, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
decently, 1
interred, 1
in, 1
the, 1
newest, 1
sack, 1
we, 1
can, 1
find., 1
Will, 1
that, 1
satisfy, 1
you?", 1
"Must, 1
this, 1
last, 1
formality, 1
take, 1
place, 1
in, 1
your, 1
presence,, 1
sir?", 1
inquired, 1
a, 1
turnkey., 1
"Certainly., 1
But, 1
make, 1
haste--I, 1
cannot, 1
stay, 1
here, 1
all, 1
day.", 1
Other, 1
footsteps,, 1
going, 1
and, 1
coming,, 1
were, 1
now, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
rustling, 1
canvas, 1
reached, 1
Dantes', 1
ears,, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
creaked,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
heavy, 1
footfall, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
lifts, 1
a, 1
weight, 1
sounded, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
again, 1
creaked, 1
under, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
deposited, 1
upon, 1
it., 1
"This, 1
evening,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"Will, 1
there, 1
be, 1
any, 1
mass?", 1
asked, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
attendants., 1
"That, 1
is, 1
impossible,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
"The, 1
chaplain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chateau, 1
came, 1
to, 1
me, 1
yesterday, 1
to, 1
beg, 1
for, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
absence,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
trip, 1
to, 1
Hyeres, 1
for, 1
a, 1
week., 1
I, 1
told, 1
him, 1
I, 1
would, 1
attend, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
in, 1
his, 1
absence., 1
If, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
hurry,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
had, 1
his, 1
requiem.", 1
"Pooh,, 1
pooh;", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
impiety, 1
usual, 1
in, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
his, 1
profession;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
churchman., 1
God, 1
will, 1
respect, 1
his, 1
profession,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
give, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
delight, 1
of, 1
sending, 1
him, 1
a, 1
priest.", 1
A, 1
shout, 1
of, 1
laughter, 1
followed, 1
this, 1
brutal, 1
jest., 1
Meanwhile, 1
the, 1
operation, 1
of, 1
putting, 1
the, 1
body, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on., 1
"This, 1
evening,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
task, 1
was, 1
ended., 1
"At, 1
what, 1
hour?", 1
inquired, 1
a, 1
turnkey., 1
"Why,, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
or, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock.", 1
"Shall, 1
we, 1
watch, 1
by, 1
the, 1
corpse?", 1
"Of, 1
what, 1
use, 1
would, 1
it, 1
be?, 1
Shut, 1
the, 1
dungeon, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
alive--that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
Then, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
retreated,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
voices, 1
died, 1
away, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distance;, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
with, 1
its, 1
creaking, 1
hinges, 1
and, 1
bolts, 1
ceased,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
silence, 1
more, 1
sombre, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
solitude, 1
ensued,--the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
all-pervasive,, 1
and, 1
struck, 1
its, 1
icy, 1
chill, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
soul, 1
of, 1
Dantes., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
flag-stone, 1
cautiously, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
carefully, 1
around, 1
the, 1
chamber., 1
It, 1
was, 1
empty,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
emerged, 1
from, 1
the, 1
tunnel., 1
Chapter, 1
20., 1
The, 1
Cemetery, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
D'If., 1
On, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
at, 1
full, 1
length,, 1
and, 1
faintly, 1
illuminated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
light, 1
that, 1
came, 1
from, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
lay, 1
a, 1
sack, 1
of, 1
canvas,, 1
and, 1
under, 1
its, 1
rude, 1
folds, 1
was, 1
stretched, 1
a, 1
long, 1
and, 1
stiffened, 1
form;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Faria's, 1
last, 1
winding-sheet,--a, 1
winding-sheet, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
turnkey, 1
said,, 1
cost, 1
so, 1
little., 1
Everything, 1
was, 1
in, 1
readiness., 1
A, 1
barrier, 1
had, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
between, 1
Dantes, 1
and, 1
his, 1
old, 1
friend., 1
No, 1
longer, 1
could, 1
Edmond, 1
look, 1
into, 1
those, 1
wide-open, 1
eyes, 1
which, 1
had, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
penetrating, 1
the, 1
mysteries, 1
of, 1
death;, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
could, 1
he, 1
clasp, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
which, 1
had, 1
done, 1
so, 1
much, 1
to, 1
make, 1
his, 1
existence, 1
blessed., 1
Faria,, 1
the, 1
beneficent, 1
and, 1
cheerful, 1
companion,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
live, 1
so, 1
intimately,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
breathed., 1
He, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
that, 1
terrible, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
melancholy, 1
and, 1
gloomy, 1
revery., 1
Alone--he, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
again--again, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
silence--again, 1
face, 1
to, 1
face, 1
with, 1
nothingness!, 1
Alone!--never, 1
again, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
face,, 1
never, 1
again, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
only, 1
human, 1
being, 1
who, 1
united, 1
him, 1
to, 1
earth!, 1
Was, 1
not, 1
Faria's, 1
fate, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
after, 1
all--to, 1
solve, 1
the, 1
problem, 1
of, 1
life, 1
at, 1
its, 1
source,, 1
even, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
horrible, 1
suffering?, 1
The, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
suicide,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
had, 1
driven, 1
away, 1
and, 1
kept, 1
away, 1
by, 1
his, 1
cheerful, 1
presence,, 1
now, 1
hovered, 1
like, 1
a, 1
phantom, 1
over, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
dead, 1
body., 1
"If, 1
I, 1
could, 1
die,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
go, 1
where, 1
he, 1
goes,, 1
and, 1
should, 1
assuredly, 1
find, 1
him, 1
again., 1
But, 1
how, 1
to, 1
die?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
easy,", 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
remain, 1
here,, 1
rush, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
person, 1
that, 1
opens, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
strangle, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
they, 1
will, 1
guillotine, 1
me.", 1
But, 1
excessive, 1
grief, 1
is, 1
like, 1
a, 1
storm, 1
at, 1
sea,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
frail, 1
bark, 1
is, 1
tossed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
to, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wave., 1
Dantes, 1
recoiled, 1
from, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
so, 1
infamous, 1
a, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
passed, 1
suddenly, 1
from, 1
despair, 1
to, 1
an, 1
ardent, 1
desire, 1
for, 1
life, 1
and, 1
liberty., 1
"Die?, 1
oh,, 1
no,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed--"not, 1
die, 1
now,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
lived, 1
and, 1
suffered, 1
so, 1
long, 1
and, 1
so, 1
much!, 1
Die?, 1
yes,, 1
had, 1
I, 1
died, 1
years, 1
ago;, 1
but, 1
now, 1
to, 1
die, 1
would, 1
be,, 1
indeed,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sarcasm, 1
of, 1
destiny., 1
No,, 1
I, 1
want, 1
to, 1
live;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
struggle, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
last;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
yet, 1
win, 1
back, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deprived., 1
Before, 1
I, 1
die, 1
I, 1
must, 1
not, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
my, 1
executioners, 1
to, 1
punish,, 1
and, 1
perhaps,, 1
too,, 1
who, 1
knows,, 1
some, 1
friends, 1
to, 1
reward., 1
Yet, 1
they, 1
will, 1
forget, 1
me, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
die, 1
in, 1
my, 1
dungeon, 1
like, 1
Faria.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
he, 1
became, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
gazed, 1
straight, 1
before, 1
him, 1
like, 1
one, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
amazing, 1
thought., 1
Suddenly, 1
he, 1
arose,, 1
lifted, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
brow, 1
as, 1
if, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
were, 1
giddy,, 1
paced, 1
twice, 1
or, 1
thrice, 1
round, 1
the, 1
dungeon,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
paused, 1
abruptly, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
"Just, 1
God!", 1
he, 1
muttered,, 1
"whence, 1
comes, 1
this, 1
thought?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
from, 1
thee?, 1
Since, 1
none, 1
but, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
pass, 1
freely, 1
from, 1
this, 1
dungeon,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
take, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead!", 1
Without, 1
giving, 1
himself, 1
time, 1
to, 1
reconsider, 1
his, 1
decision,, 1
and,, 1
indeed,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
to, 1
be, 1
distracted, 1
from, 1
his, 1
desperate, 1
resolution,, 1
he, 1
bent, 1
over, 1
the, 1
appalling, 1
shroud,, 1
opened, 1
it, 1
with, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
which, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
made,, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sack,, 1
and, 1
bore, 1
it, 1
along, 1
the, 1
tunnel, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
chamber,, 1
laid, 1
it, 1
on, 1
his, 1
couch,, 1
tied, 1
around, 1
its, 1
head, 1
the, 1
rag, 1
he, 1
wore, 1
at, 1
night, 1
around, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
his, 1
counterpane,, 1
once, 1
again, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
ice-cold, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
tried, 1
vainly, 1
to, 1
close, 1
the, 1
resisting, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
glared, 1
horribly,, 1
turned, 1
the, 1
head, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
might,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
brought, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
meal,, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
asleep,, 1
as, 1
was, 1
his, 1
frequent, 1
custom;, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
tunnel, 1
again,, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
cell,, 1
took, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hiding-place, 1
the, 1
needle, 1
and, 1
thread,, 1
flung, 1
off, 1
his, 1
rags,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
feel, 1
only, 1
naked, 1
flesh, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
coarse, 1
canvas,, 1
and, 1
getting, 1
inside, 1
the, 1
sack,, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
posture, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
body, 1
had, 1
been, 1
laid,, 1
and, 1
sewed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
from, 1
the, 1
inside., 1
He, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
discovered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
beating, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
if, 1
by, 1
any, 1
mischance, 1
the, 1
jailers, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment., 1
Dantes, 1
might, 1
have, 1
waited, 1
until, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
visit, 1
was, 1
over,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
afraid, 1
that, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
would, 1
change, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
order, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
body, 1
to, 1
be, 1
removed, 1
earlier., 1
In, 1
that, 1
case, 1
his, 1
last, 1
hope, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
destroyed., 1
Now, 1
his, 1
plans, 1
were, 1
fully, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
what, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
do., 1
If, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
being, 1
carried, 1
out, 1
the, 1
grave-diggers, 1
should, 1
discover, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
bearing, 1
a, 1
live, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
body,, 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
intend, 1
to, 1
give, 1
them, 1
time, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sudden, 1
cut, 1
of, 1
the, 1
knife,, 1
he, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
from, 1
top, 1
to, 1
bottom,, 1
and,, 1
profiting, 1
by, 1
their, 1
alarm,, 1
escape;, 1
if, 1
they, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
use, 1
his, 1
knife, 1
to, 1
better, 1
purpose., 1
If, 1
they, 1
took, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cemetery, 1
and, 1
laid, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
grave,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
allow, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
night,, 1
the, 1
grave-diggers, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
have, 1
turned, 1
their, 1
backs, 1
before, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
worked, 1
his, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
yielding, 1
soil, 1
and, 1
escaped., 1
He, 1
hoped, 1
that, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
earth, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
great, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
overcome, 1
it., 1
If, 1
he, 1
was, 1
detected, 1
in, 1
this, 1
and, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
proved, 1
too, 1
heavy,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
stifled,, 1
and, 1
then--so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
all, 1
would, 1
be, 1
over., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
not, 1
eaten, 1
since, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
evening,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
hunger,, 1
nor, 1
did, 1
he, 1
think, 1
of, 1
it, 1
now., 1
His, 1
situation, 1
was, 1
too, 1
precarious, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
him, 1
even, 1
time, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
on, 1
any, 1
thought, 1
but, 1
one., 1
The, 1
first, 1
risk, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
ran, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
jailer,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
his, 1
supper, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock,, 1
might, 1
perceive, 1
the, 1
change, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made;, 1
fortunately,, 1
twenty, 1
times, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
from, 1
misanthropy, 1
or, 1
fatigue,, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
received, 1
his, 1
jailer, 1
in, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
man, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
soup, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
away, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word., 1
This, 1
time, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
as, 1
silent, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
but, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
he, 1
received, 1
no, 1
reply,, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
discover, 1
all., 1
When, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
came,, 1
Dantes', 1
agony, 1
really, 1
began., 1
His, 1
hand, 1
placed, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
redress, 1
its, 1
throbbings,, 1
while,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
he, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
temples., 1
From, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
chills, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
body,, 1
and, 1
clutched, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
in, 1
a, 1
grasp, 1
of, 1
ice., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
die., 1
Yet, 1
the, 1
hours, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
without, 1
any, 1
unusual, 1
disturbance,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
first, 1
peril., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
good, 1
augury., 1
At, 1
length,, 1
about, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
had, 1
appointed,, 1
footsteps, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
had, 1
arrived,, 1
summoned, 1
up, 1
all, 1
his, 1
courage,, 1
held, 1
his, 1
breath,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
happy, 1
if, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
he, 1
could, 1
have, 1
repressed, 1
the, 1
throbbing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
veins., 1
The, 1
footsteps--they, 1
were, 1
double--paused, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door--and, 1
Dantes, 1
guessed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
grave-diggers, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
him--this, 1
idea, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
converted, 1
into, 1
certainty,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
they, 1
made, 1
in, 1
putting, 1
down, 1
the, 1
hand-bier., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
dim, 1
light, 1
reached, 1
Dantes', 1
eyes, 1
through, 1
the, 1
coarse, 1
sack, 1
that, 1
covered, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
two, 1
shadows, 1
approach, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
a, 1
third, 1
remaining, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
with, 1
a, 1
torch, 1
in, 1
its, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
two, 1
men,, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
ends, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
by, 1
its, 1
extremities., 1
"He's, 1
heavy, 1
though, 1
for, 1
an, 1
old, 1
and, 1
thin, 1
man,", 1
said, 1
one,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
head., 1
"They, 1
say, 1
every, 1
year, 1
adds, 1
half, 1
a, 1
pound, 1
to, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bones,", 1
said, 1
another,, 1
lifting, 1
the, 1
feet., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
tied, 1
the, 1
knot?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
first, 1
speaker., 1
"What, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
so, 1
much, 1
more, 1
weight?", 1
was, 1
the, 1
reply,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
that, 1
when, 1
we, 1
get, 1
there.", 1
"Yes,, 1
you're, 1
right,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
companion., 1
"What's, 1
the, 1
knot, 1
for?", 1
thought, 1
Dantes., 1
They, 1
deposited, 1
the, 1
supposed, 1
corpse, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bier., 1
Edmond, 1
stiffened, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
play, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
party,, 1
lighted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
torch,, 1
who, 1
went, 1
first,, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
Suddenly, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
and, 1
sharp, 1
night, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mistral, 1
was, 1
blowing., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
sensation, 1
in, 1
which, 1
pleasure, 1
and, 1
pain, 1
were, 1
strangely, 1
mingled., 1
The, 1
bearers, 1
went, 1
on, 1
for, 1
twenty, 1
paces,, 1
then, 1
stopped,, 1
putting, 1
the, 1
bier, 1
down, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
One, 1
of, 1
them, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
shoes, 1
striking, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pavement., 1
"Where, 1
am, 1
I?", 1
he, 1
asked, 1
himself., 1
"Really,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
a, 1
light, 1
load!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
other, 1
bearer,, 1
sitting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand-barrow., 1
Dantes', 1
first, 1
impulse, 1
was, 1
to, 1
escape,, 1
but, 1
fortunately, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
attempt, 1
it., 1
"Give, 1
us, 1
a, 1
light,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
other, 1
bearer,, 1
"or, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
find, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
looking, 1
for.", 1
The, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
torch, 1
complied,, 1
although, 1
not, 1
asked, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
polite, 1
terms., 1
"What, 1
can, 1
he, 1
be, 1
looking, 1
for?", 1
thought, 1
Edmond., 1
"The, 1
spade,, 1
perhaps.", 1
An, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
satisfaction, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
the, 1
grave-digger, 1
had, 1
found, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
his, 1
search., 1
"Here, 1
it, 1
is, 1
at, 1
last,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"not, 1
without, 1
some, 1
trouble, 1
though.", 1
"Yes,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
answer,, 1
"but, 1
it, 1
has, 1
lost, 1
nothing, 1
by, 1
waiting.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
came, 1
towards, 1
Edmond,, 1
who, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
metallic, 1
substance, 1
laid, 1
down, 1
beside, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
cord, 1
was, 1
fastened, 1
round, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
with, 1
sudden, 1
and, 1
painful, 1
violence., 1
"Well,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
tied, 1
the, 1
knot?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
grave-digger,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
on., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
pretty, 1
tight, 1
too,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
you,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
answer., 1
"Move, 1
on,, 1
then.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
bier, 1
was, 1
lifted, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
proceeded., 1
They, 1
advanced, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
farther,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
open, 1
a, 1
door,, 1
then, 1
went, 1
forward, 1
again., 1
The, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
dashing, 1
against, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
chateau, 1
is, 1
built,, 1
reached, 1
Dantes', 1
ear, 1
distinctly, 1
as, 1
they, 1
went, 1
forward., 1
"Bad, 1
weather!", 1
observed, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bearers;, 1
"not, 1
a, 1
pleasant, 1
night, 1
for, 1
a, 1
dip, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sea.", 1
"Why,, 1
yes,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
runs, 1
a, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
being, 1
wet,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
other;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
brutal, 1
laughter., 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
comprehend, 1
the, 1
jest,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
stood, 1
erect, 1
on, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Well,, 1
here, 1
we, 1
are, 1
at, 1
last,", 1
said, 1
one, 1
of, 1
them., 1
"A, 1
little, 1
farther--a, 1
little, 1
farther,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
other., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
very, 1
well, 1
that, 1
the, 1
last, 1
was, 1
stopped, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
dashed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
rocks,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
told, 1
us, 1
next, 1
day, 1
that, 1
we, 1
were, 1
careless, 1
fellows.", 1
They, 1
ascended, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
more, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
Dantes, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
they, 1
took, 1
him,, 1
one, 1
by, 1
the, 1
head, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
by, 1
the, 1
heels,, 1
and, 1
swung, 1
him, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro., 1
"One!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
grave-diggers,, 1
"two!, 1
three!", 1
And, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
Dantes, 1
felt, 1
himself, 1
flung, 1
into, 1
the, 1
air, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wounded, 1
bird,, 1
falling,, 1
falling,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
rapidity, 1
that, 1
made, 1
his, 1
blood, 1
curdle., 1
Although, 1
drawn, 1
downwards, 1
by, 1
the, 1
heavy, 1
weight, 1
which, 1
hastened, 1
his, 1
rapid, 1
descent,, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
fall, 1
lasted, 1
for, 1
a, 1
century., 1
At, 1
last,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
horrible, 1
splash,, 1
he, 1
darted, 1
like, 1
an, 1
arrow, 1
into, 1
the, 1
ice-cold, 1
water,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
did, 1
so, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
shrill, 1
cry,, 1
stifled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
by, 1
his, 1
immersion, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
waves., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
been, 1
flung, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
dragged, 1
into, 1
its, 1
depths, 1
by, 1
a, 1
thirty-six, 1
pound, 1
shot, 1
tied, 1
to, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
The, 1
sea, 1
is, 1
the, 1
cemetery, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
Chapter, 1
21., 1
The, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Tiboulen., 1
Dantes,, 1
although, 1
stunned, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
suffocated,, 1
had, 1
sufficient, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
his, 1
breath,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
his, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
(prepared, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
for, 1
every, 1
chance), 1
held, 1
his, 1
knife, 1
open,, 1
he, 1
rapidly, 1
ripped, 1
up, 1
the, 1
sack,, 1
extricated, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
his, 1
body;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
his, 1
efforts, 1
to, 1
free, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
the, 1
shot,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
it, 1
dragging, 1
him, 1
down, 1
still, 1
lower., 1
He, 1
then, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
body,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
a, 1
desperate, 1
effort, 1
severed, 1
the, 1
cord, 1
that, 1
bound, 1
his, 1
legs,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
actually, 1
strangled., 1
With, 1
a, 1
mighty, 1
leap, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
shot, 1
dragged, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
that, 1
had, 1
so, 1
nearly, 1
become, 1
his, 1
shroud., 1
Dantes, 1
waited, 1
only, 1
to, 1
get, 1
breath,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
dived,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
being, 1
seen., 1
When, 1
he, 1
arose, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
first, 1
sunk., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
overhead, 1
a, 1
black, 1
and, 1
tempestuous, 1
sky,, 1
across, 1
which, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
was, 1
driving, 1
clouds, 1
that, 1
occasionally, 1
suffered, 1
a, 1
twinkling, 1
star, 1
to, 1
appear;, 1
before, 1
him, 1
was, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
expanse, 1
of, 1
waters,, 1
sombre, 1
and, 1
terrible,, 1
whose, 1
waves, 1
foamed, 1
and, 1
roared, 1
as, 1
if, 1
before, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
a, 1
storm., 1
Behind, 1
him,, 1
blacker, 1
than, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
blacker, 1
than, 1
the, 1
sky,, 1
rose, 1
phantom-like, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
stone, 1
structure,, 1
whose, 1
projecting, 1
crags, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
arms, 1
extended, 1
to, 1
seize, 1
their, 1
prey,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
rock, 1
was, 1
a, 1
torch, 1
lighting, 1
two, 1
figures., 1
He, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
these, 1
two, 1
forms, 1
were, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sea;, 1
doubtless, 1
these, 1
strange, 1
grave-diggers, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
cry., 1
Dantes, 1
dived, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
water., 1
This, 1
was, 1
an, 1
easy, 1
feat, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
usually, 1
attracted, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
spectators, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bay, 1
before, 1
the, 1
lighthouse, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
when, 1
he, 1
swam, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
unanimously, 1
declared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
best, 1
swimmer, 1
in, 1
the, 1
port., 1
When, 1
he, 1
came, 1
up, 1
again, 1
the, 1
light, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
He, 1
must, 1
now, 1
get, 1
his, 1
bearings., 1
Ratonneau, 1
and, 1
Pomegue, 1
are, 1
the, 1
nearest, 1
islands, 1
of, 1
all, 1
those, 1
that, 1
surround, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
but, 1
Ratonneau, 1
and, 1
Pomegue, 1
are, 1
inhabited,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
also, 1
the, 1
islet, 1
of, 1
Daume., 1
Tiboulen, 1
and, 1
Lemaire, 1
were, 1
therefore, 1
the, 1
safest, 1
for, 1
Dantes', 1
venture., 1
The, 1
islands, 1
of, 1
Tiboulen, 1
and, 1
Lemaire, 1
are, 1
a, 1
league, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If;, 1
Dantes,, 1
nevertheless,, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
make, 1
for, 1
them., 1
But, 1
how, 1
could, 1
he, 1
find, 1
his, 1
way, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night?, 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
Planier,, 1
gleaming, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
him, 1
like, 1
a, 1
star., 1
By, 1
leaving, 1
this, 1
light, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right,, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Tiboulen, 1
a, 1
little, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left;, 1
by, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
therefore,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
find, 1
it., 1
But,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
league, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
to, 1
this, 1
island., 1
Often, 1
in, 1
prison, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
said, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
idle, 1
and, 1
inactive,, 1
"Dantes,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
give, 1
way, 1
to, 1
this, 1
listlessness;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
drowned, 1
if, 1
you, 1
seek, 1
to, 1
escape,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
strength, 1
has, 1
not, 1
been, 1
properly, 1
exercised, 1
and, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
exertion.", 1
These, 1
words, 1
rang, 1
in, 1
Dantes', 1
ears,, 1
even, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
waves;, 1
he, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
cleave, 1
his, 1
way, 1
through, 1
them, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
lost, 1
his, 1
strength., 1
He, 1
found, 1
with, 1
pleasure, 1
that, 1
his, 1
captivity, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
power,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
still, 1
master, 1
of, 1
that, 1
element, 1
on, 1
whose, 1
bosom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
sported, 1
as, 1
a, 1
boy., 1
Fear,, 1
that, 1
relentless, 1
pursuer,, 1
clogged, 1
Dantes', 1
efforts., 1
He, 1
listened, 1
for, 1
any, 1
sound, 1
that, 1
might, 1
be, 1
audible,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
time, 1
that, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
a, 1
wave, 1
he, 1
scanned, 1
the, 1
horizon,, 1
and, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
He, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
every, 1
wave, 1
behind, 1
him, 1
was, 1
a, 1
pursuing, 1
boat,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
redoubled, 1
his, 1
exertions,, 1
increasing, 1
rapidly, 1
his, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
the, 1
chateau,, 1
but, 1
exhausting, 1
his, 1
strength., 1
He, 1
swam, 1
on, 1
still,, 1
and, 1
already, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
chateau, 1
had, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
He, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
its, 1
presence., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
passed,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Dantes,, 1
excited, 1
by, 1
the, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
freedom,, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
cleave, 1
the, 1
waves., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
swum, 1
above, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
is, 1
against, 1
me,, 1
that, 1
has, 1
retarded, 1
my, 1
speed;, 1
however,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mistaken,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
close, 1
to, 1
Tiboulen., 1
But, 1
what, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
mistaken?", 1
A, 1
shudder, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
him., 1
He, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
tread, 1
water,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
rest, 1
himself;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
was, 1
too, 1
violent,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
this, 1
means, 1
of, 1
recuperation., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
swim, 1
on, 1
until, 1
I, 1
am, 1
worn, 1
out,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
cramp, 1
seizes, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
sink;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
out, 1
with, 1
the, 1
energy, 1
of, 1
despair., 1
Suddenly, 1
the, 1
sky, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
become, 1
still, 1
darker, 1
and, 1
more, 1
dense,, 1
and, 1
heavy, 1
clouds, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
sweep, 1
down, 1
towards, 1
him;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
sharp, 1
pain, 1
in, 1
his, 1
knee., 1
He, 1
fancied, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
shot,, 1
and, 1
listened, 1
for, 1
the, 1
report;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
nothing., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
put, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
encountered, 1
an, 1
obstacle, 1
and, 1
with, 1
another, 1
stroke, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
shore., 1
Before, 1
him, 1
rose, 1
a, 1
grotesque, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
rocks,, 1
that, 1
resembled, 1
nothing, 1
so, 1
much, 1
as, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
fire, 1
petrified, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
its, 1
most, 1
fervent, 1
combustion., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Tiboulen., 1
Dantes, 1
rose,, 1
advanced, 1
a, 1
few, 1
steps,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fervent, 1
prayer, 1
of, 1
gratitude,, 1
stretched, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
granite,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
softer, 1
than, 1
down., 1
Then,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
and, 1
rain,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
the, 1
deep,, 1
sweet, 1
sleep, 1
of, 1
utter, 1
exhaustion., 1
At, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
awakened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
roar, 1
of, 1
thunder., 1
The, 1
tempest, 1
was, 1
let, 1
loose, 1
and, 1
beating, 1
the, 1
atmosphere, 1
with, 1
its, 1
mighty, 1
wings;, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
a, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
lightning, 1
stretched, 1
across, 1
the, 1
heavens, 1
like, 1
a, 1
fiery, 1
serpent,, 1
lighting, 1
up, 1
the, 1
clouds, 1
that, 1
rolled, 1
on, 1
in, 1
vast, 1
chaotic, 1
waves., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
deceived--he, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
first, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
islands,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
Tiboulen., 1
He, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
barren, 1
and, 1
without, 1
shelter;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
became, 1
more, 1
calm,, 1
he, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
plunge, 1
into, 1
its, 1
waves, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
swim, 1
to, 1
Lemaire,, 1
equally, 1
arid,, 1
but, 1
larger,, 1
and, 1
consequently, 1
better, 1
adapted, 1
for, 1
concealment., 1
An, 1
overhanging, 1
rock, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
a, 1
temporary, 1
shelter,, 1
and, 1
scarcely, 1
had, 1
he, 1
availed, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
it, 1
when, 1
the, 1
tempest, 1
burst, 1
forth, 1
in, 1
all, 1
its, 1
fury., 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
trembling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
beneath, 1
which, 1
he, 1
lay;, 1
the, 1
waves,, 1
dashing, 1
themselves, 1
against, 1
it,, 1
wetted, 1
him, 1
with, 1
their, 1
spray., 1
He, 1
was, 1
safely, 1
sheltered,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
dizzy, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
warring, 1
of, 1
the, 1
elements, 1
and, 1
the, 1
dazzling, 1
brightness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lightning., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
island, 1
trembled, 1
to, 1
its, 1
base,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
at, 1
anchor,, 1
break, 1
moorings,, 1
and, 1
bear, 1
him, 1
off, 1
into, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
storm., 1
He, 1
then, 1
recollected, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
eaten, 1
or, 1
drunk, 1
for, 1
four-and-twenty, 1
hours., 1
He, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
greedily, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rainwater, 1
that, 1
had, 1
lodged, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hollow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock., 1
As, 1
he, 1
rose,, 1
a, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
lightning,, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
rive, 1
the, 1
remotest, 1
heights, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
By, 1
its, 1
light,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Lemaire, 1
and, 1
Cape, 1
Croiselle,, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
league, 1
distant,, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
fishing-boat, 1
driven, 1
rapidly, 1
like, 1
a, 1
spectre, 1
before, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
winds, 1
and, 1
waves., 1
A, 1
second, 1
after,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
again,, 1
approaching, 1
with, 1
frightful, 1
rapidity., 1
Dantes, 1
cried, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
to, 1
warn, 1
them, 1
of, 1
their, 1
danger,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
themselves., 1
Another, 1
flash, 1
showed, 1
him, 1
four, 1
men, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
shattered, 1
mast, 1
and, 1
the, 1
rigging,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
fifth, 1
clung, 1
to, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
rudder., 1
The, 1
men, 1
he, 1
beheld, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
undoubtedly,, 1
for, 1
their, 1
cries, 1
were, 1
carried, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ears, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wind., 1
Above, 1
the, 1
splintered, 1
mast, 1
a, 1
sail, 1
rent, 1
to, 1
tatters, 1
was, 1
waving;, 1
suddenly, 1
the, 1
ropes, 1
that, 1
still, 1
held, 1
it, 1
gave, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night, 1
like, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
sea-bird., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
crash, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
cries, 1
of, 1
distress., 1
Dantes, 1
from, 1
his, 1
rocky, 1
perch, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
shattered, 1
vessel,, 1
and, 1
among, 1
the, 1
fragments, 1
the, 1
floating, 1
forms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hapless, 1
sailors., 1
Then, 1
all, 1
was, 1
dark, 1
again., 1
Dantes, 1
ran, 1
down, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1
himself, 1
dashed, 1
to, 1
pieces;, 1
he, 1
listened,, 1
he, 1
groped, 1
about,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
nothing--the, 1
cries, 1
had, 1
ceased,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tempest, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
rage., 1
By, 1
degrees, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
abated,, 1
vast, 1
gray, 1
clouds, 1
rolled, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
west,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
firmament, 1
appeared, 1
studded, 1
with, 1
bright, 1
stars., 1
Soon, 1
a, 1
red, 1
streak, 1
became, 1
visible, 1
in, 1
the, 1
horizon,, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
whitened,, 1
a, 1
light, 1
played, 1
over, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
gilded, 1
their, 1
foaming, 1
crests, 1
with, 1
gold., 1
It, 1
was, 1
day., 1
Dantes, 1
stood, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
before, 1
this, 1
majestic, 1
spectacle,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
now, 1
beheld, 1
it, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time;, 1
and, 1
indeed, 1
since, 1
his, 1
captivity, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
he, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
that, 1
such, 1
scenes, 1
were, 1
ever, 1
to, 1
be, 1
witnessed., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
fortress,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
both, 1
sea, 1
and, 1
land., 1
The, 1
gloomy, 1
building, 1
rose, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bosom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean, 1
with, 1
imposing, 1
majesty, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
dominate, 1
the, 1
scene., 1
It, 1
was, 1
about, 1
five, 1
o'clock., 1
The, 1
sea, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
get, 1
calmer., 1
"In, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
hours,", 1
thought, 1
Dantes,, 1
"the, 1
turnkey, 1
will, 1
enter, 1
my, 1
chamber,, 1
find, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
friend,, 1
recognize, 1
it,, 1
seek, 1
for, 1
me, 1
in, 1
vain,, 1
and, 1
give, 1
the, 1
alarm., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
tunnel, 1
will, 1
be, 1
discovered;, 1
the, 1
men, 1
who, 1
cast, 1
me, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
and, 1
who, 1
must, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
I, 1
uttered,, 1
will, 1
be, 1
questioned., 1
Then, 1
boats, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
armed, 1
soldiers, 1
will, 1
pursue, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
fugitive., 1
The, 1
cannon, 1
will, 1
warn, 1
every, 1
one, 1
to, 1
refuse, 1
shelter, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man, 1
wandering, 1
about, 1
naked, 1
and, 1
famished., 1
The, 1
police, 1
of, 1
Marseilles, 1
will, 1
be, 1
on, 1
the, 1
alert, 1
by, 1
land,, 1
whilst, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
pursues, 1
me, 1
by, 1
sea., 1
I, 1
am, 1
cold,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
hungry., 1
I, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
even, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
that, 1
saved, 1
me., 1
O, 1
my, 1
God,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
enough, 1
surely!, 1
Have, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
for, 1
me, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
do, 1
for, 1
myself.", 1
As, 1
Dantes, 1
(his, 1
eyes, 1
turned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If), 1
uttered, 1
this, 1
prayer,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
off, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
point, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Pomegue, 1
a, 1
small, 1
vessel, 1
with, 1
lateen, 1
sail, 1
skimming, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
like, 1
a, 1
gull, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
prey;, 1
and, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sailor's, 1
eye, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
Genoese, 1
tartan., 1
She, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Marseilles, 1
harbor,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
out, 1
to, 1
sea, 1
rapidly,, 1
her, 1
sharp, 1
prow, 1
cleaving, 1
through, 1
the, 1
waves., 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
Edmond,, 1
"to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
I, 1
could, 1
join, 1
her,, 1
did, 1
I, 1
not, 1
fear, 1
being, 1
questioned,, 1
detected,, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Marseilles!, 1
What, 1
can, 1
I, 1
do?, 1
What, 1
story, 1
can, 1
I, 1
invent?, 1
under, 1
pretext, 1
of, 1
trading, 1
along, 1
the, 1
coast,, 1
these, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
smugglers,, 1
will, 1
prefer, 1
selling, 1
me, 1
to, 1
doing, 1
a, 1
good, 1
action., 1
I, 1
must, 1
wait., 1
But, 1
I, 1
cannot----, 1
I, 1
am, 1
starving., 1
In, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hours, 1
my, 1
strength, 1
will, 1
be, 1
utterly, 1
exhausted;, 1
besides,, 1
perhaps, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
missed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fortress., 1
I, 1
can, 1
pass, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
wrecked, 1
last, 1
night., 1
My, 1
story, 1
will, 1
be, 1
accepted,, 1
for, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
one, 1
left, 1
to, 1
contradict, 1
me.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
Dantes, 1
looked, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
the, 1
fishing-vessel, 1
had, 1
been, 1
wrecked,, 1
and, 1
started., 1
The, 1
red, 1
cap, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
hung, 1
to, 1
a, 1
point, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
and, 1
some, 1
timbers, 1
that, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vessel's, 1
keel,, 1
floated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crag., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
Dantes', 1
plan, 1
was, 1
formed., 1
He, 1
swam, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cap,, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
seized, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
timbers,, 1
and, 1
struck, 1
out, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
across, 1
the, 1
course, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
taking., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
saved!", 1
murmured, 1
he., 1
And, 1
this, 1
conviction, 1
restored, 1
his, 1
strength., 1
He, 1
soon, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
the, 1
vessel,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
dead, 1
ahead,, 1
was, 1
tacking, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tower, 1
of, 1
Planier., 1
For, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
lest,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
keeping, 1
in, 1
shore,, 1
she, 1
should, 1
stand, 1
out, 1
to, 1
sea;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
pass,, 1
like, 1
most, 1
vessels, 1
bound, 1
for, 1
Italy,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
islands, 1
of, 1
Jaros, 1
and, 1
Calaseraigne., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
and, 1
the, 1
swimmer, 1
insensibly, 1
neared, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
its, 1
tacks, 1
the, 1
tartan, 1
bore, 1
down, 1
within, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mile, 1
of, 1
him., 1
He, 1
rose, 1
on, 1
the, 1
waves,, 1
making, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
distress;, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
on, 1
board, 1
saw, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
stood, 1
on, 1
another, 1
tack., 1
Dantes, 1
would, 1
have, 1
shouted,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
would, 1
drown, 1
his, 1
voice., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
he, 1
rejoiced, 1
at, 1
his, 1
precaution, 1
in, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
timber,, 1
for, 1
without, 1
it, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
unable,, 1
perhaps,, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
vessel--certainly, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
shore,, 1
should, 1
he, 1
be, 1
unsuccessful, 1
in, 1
attracting, 1
attention., 1
Dantes,, 1
though, 1
almost, 1
sure, 1
as, 1
to, 1
what, 1
course, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
would, 1
take,, 1
had, 1
yet, 1
watched, 1
it, 1
anxiously, 1
until, 1
it, 1
tacked, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
advanced;, 1
but, 1
before, 1
they, 1
could, 1
meet,, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
again, 1
changed, 1
her, 1
course., 1
By, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
half, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
water,, 1
waving, 1
his, 1
cap,, 1
and, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
shout, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
sailers., 1
This, 1
time, 1
he, 1
was, 1
both, 1
seen, 1
and, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tartan, 1
instantly, 1
steered, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
they, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
lower, 1
the, 1
boat., 1
An, 1
instant, 1
after,, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
rowed, 1
by, 1
two, 1
men,, 1
advanced, 1
rapidly, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
let, 1
go, 1
of, 1
the, 1
timber,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
now, 1
thought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
useless,, 1
and, 1
swam, 1
vigorously, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
them., 1
But, 1
he, 1
had, 1
reckoned, 1
too, 1
much, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
strength,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
realized, 1
how, 1
serviceable, 1
the, 1
timber, 1
had, 1
been, 1
to, 1
him., 1
His, 1
arms, 1
became, 1
stiff,, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
lost, 1
their, 1
flexibility,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
breathless., 1
He, 1
shouted, 1
again., 1
The, 1
two, 1
sailors, 1
redoubled, 1
their, 1
efforts,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
of, 1
them, 1
cried, 1
in, 1
Italian,, 1
"Courage!", 1
The, 1
word, 1
reached, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
as, 1
a, 1
wave, 1
which, 1
he, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
had, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
surmount, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
head., 1
He, 1
rose, 1
again, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surface,, 1
struggled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
last, 1
desperate, 1
effort, 1
of, 1
a, 1
drowning, 1
man,, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
third, 1
cry,, 1
and, 1
felt, 1
himself, 1
sinking,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
cannon, 1
shot, 1
were, 1
again, 1
tied, 1
to, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
The, 1
water, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sky, 1
turned, 1
gray., 1
A, 1
convulsive, 1
movement, 1
again, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surface., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
himself, 1
seized, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hair,, 1
then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
nothing., 1
He, 1
had, 1
fainted., 1
When, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
Dantes, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
deck, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tartan., 1
His, 1
first, 1
care, 1
was, 1
to, 1
see, 1
what, 1
course, 1
they, 1
were, 1
taking., 1
They, 1
were, 1
rapidly, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
behind., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
so, 1
exhausted, 1
that, 1
the, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
was, 1
mistaken, 1
for, 1
a, 1
sigh., 1
As, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
lying, 1
on, 1
the, 1
deck., 1
A, 1
sailor, 1
was, 1
rubbing, 1
his, 1
limbs, 1
with, 1
a, 1
woollen, 1
cloth;, 1
another,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
recognized, 1
as, 1
the, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
cried, 1
out, 1
"Courage!", 1
held, 1
a, 1
gourd, 1
full, 1
of, 1
rum, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mouth;, 1
while, 1
the, 1
third,, 1
an, 1
old, 1
sailer,, 1
at, 1
once, 1
the, 1
pilot, 1
and, 1
captain,, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
with, 1
that, 1
egotistical, 1
pity, 1
men, 1
feel, 1
for, 1
a, 1
misfortune, 1
that, 1
they, 1
have, 1
escaped, 1
yesterday,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
may, 1
overtake, 1
them, 1
to-morrow., 1
A, 1
few, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rum, 1
restored, 1
suspended, 1
animation,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
friction, 1
of, 1
his, 1
limbs, 1
restored, 1
their, 1
elasticity., 1
"Who, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
pilot, 1
in, 1
bad, 1
French., 1
"I, 1
am,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
in, 1
bad, 1
Italian,, 1
"a, 1
Maltese, 1
sailor., 1
We, 1
were, 1
coming, 1
from, 1
Syracuse, 1
laden, 1
with, 1
grain., 1
The, 1
storm, 1
of, 1
last, 1
night, 1
overtook, 1
us, 1
at, 1
Cape, 1
Morgion,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
were, 1
wrecked, 1
on, 1
these, 1
rocks.", 1
"Where, 1
do, 1
you, 1
come, 1
from?", 1
"From, 1
these, 1
rocks, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
good, 1
luck, 1
to, 1
cling, 1
to, 1
while, 1
our, 1
captain, 1
and, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
were, 1
all, 1
lost., 1
I, 1
saw, 1
your, 1
vessel,, 1
and, 1
fearful, 1
of, 1
being, 1
left, 1
to, 1
perish, 1
on, 1
the, 1
desolate, 1
island,, 1
I, 1
swam, 1
off, 1
on, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
wreckage, 1
to, 1
try, 1
and, 1
intercept, 1
your, 1
course., 1
You, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
my, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you,", 1
continued, 1
Dantes., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
when, 1
one, 1
of, 1
your, 1
sailors, 1
caught, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
my, 1
hair.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
I,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
frank, 1
and, 1
manly, 1
appearance;, 1
"and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
time,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
were, 1
sinking.", 1
"Yes,", 1
returned, 1
Dantes,, 1
holding, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
again.", 1
"I, 1
almost, 1
hesitated,, 1
though,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
sailor;, 1
"you, 1
looked, 1
more, 1
like, 1
a, 1
brigand, 1
than, 1
an, 1
honest, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
beard, 1
six, 1
inches,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
hair, 1
a, 1
foot, 1
long.", 1
Dantes, 1
recollected, 1
that, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
and, 1
beard, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
cut, 1
all, 1
the, 1
time, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
made, 1
a, 1
vow,, 1
to, 1
our, 1
Lady, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Grotto, 1
not, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
my, 1
hair, 1
or, 1
beard, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
saved, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
danger;, 1
but, 1
to-day, 1
the, 1
vow, 1
expires.", 1
"Now, 1
what, 1
are, 1
we, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"Alas,, 1
anything, 1
you, 1
please., 1
My, 1
captain, 1
is, 1
dead;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
barely, 1
escaped;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
good, 1
sailor., 1
Leave, 1
me, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
port, 1
you, 1
make;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
find, 1
employment.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
sailed, 1
over, 1
it, 1
since, 1
my, 1
childhood.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
the, 1
best, 1
harbors?", 1
"There, 1
are, 1
few, 1
ports, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
enter, 1
or, 1
leave, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bandage, 1
over, 1
my, 1
eyes.", 1
"I, 1
say,, 1
captain,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
sailor, 1
who, 1
had, 1
cried, 1
"Courage!", 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
"if, 1
what, 1
he, 1
says, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
what, 1
hinders, 1
his, 1
staying, 1
with, 1
us?", 1
"If, 1
he, 1
says, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
doubtingly., 1
"But, 1
in, 1
his, 1
present, 1
condition, 1
he, 1
will, 1
promise, 1
anything,, 1
and, 1
take, 1
his, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
keeping, 1
it, 1
afterwards.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
more, 1
than, 1
I, 1
promise,", 1
said, 1
Dantes., 1
"We, 1
shall, 1
see,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
smiling., 1
"Where, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes., 1
"To, 1
Leghorn.", 1
"Then, 1
why,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
tacking, 1
so, 1
frequently,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
sail, 1
nearer, 1
the, 1
wind?", 1
"Because, 1
we, 1
should, 1
run, 1
straight, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Rion.", 1
"You, 1
shall, 1
pass, 1
it, 1
by, 1
twenty, 1
fathoms.", 1
"Take, 1
the, 1
helm,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
what, 1
you, 1
know.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
took, 1
the, 1
helm,, 1
felt, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
answered, 1
the, 1
rudder, 1
promptly, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
that,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
a, 1
first-rate, 1
sailer,, 1
she, 1
yet, 1
was, 1
tolerably, 1
obedient,--, 1
"To, 1
the, 1
sheets,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
The, 1
four, 1
seamen,, 1
who, 1
composed, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
obeyed,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
pilot, 1
looked, 1
on., 1
"Haul, 1
taut."--They, 1
obeyed., 1
"Belay.", 1
This, 1
order, 1
was, 1
also, 1
executed;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
passed,, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
predicted,, 1
twenty, 1
fathoms, 1
to, 1
windward., 1
"Bravo!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"Bravo!", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
sailors., 1
And, 1
they, 1
all, 1
looked, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
this, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
eye, 1
now, 1
disclosed, 1
an, 1
intelligence, 1
and, 1
his, 1
body, 1
a, 1
vigor, 1
they, 1
had, 1
not, 1
thought, 1
him, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
showing., 1
"You, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
quitting, 1
the, 1
helm,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
of, 1
some, 1
use, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
during, 1
the, 1
voyage., 1
If, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
want, 1
me, 1
at, 1
Leghorn,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
pay, 1
you, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
wages, 1
I, 1
get,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
food, 1
and, 1
the, 1
clothes, 1
you, 1
lend, 1
me.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"we, 1
can, 1
agree, 1
very, 1
well,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
reasonable.", 1
"Give, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
give, 1
the, 1
others,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
all, 1
right,", 1
returned, 1
Dantes., 1
"That's, 1
not, 1
fair,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
seaman, 1
who, 1
had, 1
saved, 1
Dantes;, 1
"for, 1
you, 1
know, 1
more, 1
than, 1
we, 1
do.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
Jacopo?", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
Captain., 1
"Every, 1
one, 1
is, 1
free, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
what, 1
he, 1
pleases.", 1
"That's, 1
true,", 1
replied, 1
Jacopo;, 1
"I, 1
only, 1
make, 1
a, 1
remark.", 1
"Well,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
do, 1
much, 1
better, 1
to, 1
find, 1
him, 1
a, 1
jacket, 1
and, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
trousers,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
them.", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Jacopo;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
shirt, 1
and, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
trousers.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
want,", 1
interrupted, 1
Dantes., 1
Jacopo, 1
dived, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hold, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
what, 1
Edmond, 1
wanted., 1
"Now,, 1
then,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
anything, 1
else?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
patron., 1
"A, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
another, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
rum, 1
I, 1
tasted,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
eaten, 1
or, 1
drunk, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time.", 1
He, 1
had, 1
not, 1
tasted, 1
food, 1
for, 1
forty, 1
hours., 1
A, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
was, 1
brought,, 1
and, 1
Jacopo, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
the, 1
gourd., 1
"Larboard, 1
your, 1
helm,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
to, 1
the, 1
steersman., 1
Dantes, 1
glanced, 1
that, 1
way, 1
as, 1
he, 1
lifted, 1
the, 1
gourd, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mouth;, 1
then, 1
paused, 1
with, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
mid-air., 1
"Hollo!, 1
what's, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
A, 1
small, 1
white, 1
cloud,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
attracted, 1
Dantes', 1
attention,, 1
crowned, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bastion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
faint, 1
report, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gun, 1
was, 1
heard., 1
The, 1
sailors, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
one, 1
another., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
this?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"A, 1
prisoner, 1
has, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
are, 1
firing, 1
the, 1
alarm, 1
gun,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes., 1
The, 1
captain, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lifted, 1
the, 1
rum, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
and, 1
was, 1
drinking, 1
it, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
composure,, 1
that, 1
suspicions,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
had, 1
any,, 1
died, 1
away., 1
"At, 1
any, 1
rate,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
"if, 1
it, 1
be,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
rare, 1
acquisition.", 1
Under, 1
pretence, 1
of, 1
being, 1
fatigued,, 1
Dantes, 1
asked, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
helm;, 1
the, 1
steersman,, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
be, 1
relieved,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
abandon, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
new, 1
comrade., 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
thus, 1
keep, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
Marseilles., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
day, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month?", 1
asked, 1
he, 1
of, 1
Jacopo,, 1
who, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
"The, 1
28th, 1
of, 1
February.", 1
"In, 1
what, 1
year?", 1
"In, 1
what, 1
year--you, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
in, 1
what, 1
year?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
in, 1
what, 1
year!", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
forgotten, 1
then?", 1
"I, 1
got, 1
such, 1
a, 1
fright, 1
last, 1
night,", 1
replied, 1
Dantes,, 1
smiling,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
almost, 1
lost, 1
my, 1
memory., 1
I, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
what, 1
year, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"The, 1
year, 1
1829,", 1
returned, 1
Jacopo., 1
It, 1
was, 1
fourteen, 1
years, 1
day, 1
for, 1
day, 1
since, 1
Dantes', 1
arrest., 1
He, 1
was, 1
nineteen, 1
when, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thirty-three, 1
when, 1
he, 1
escaped., 1
A, 1
sorrowful, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
face;, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
himself, 1
what, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
who, 1
must, 1
believe, 1
him, 1
dead., 1
Then, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
with, 1
hatred, 1
as, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
men, 1
who, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
him, 1
so, 1
long, 1
and, 1
wretched, 1
a, 1
captivity., 1
He, 1
renewed, 1
against, 1
Danglars,, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
the, 1
oath, 1
of, 1
implacable, 1
vengeance, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
in, 1
his, 1
dungeon., 1
This, 1
oath, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
a, 1
vain, 1
menace;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fastest, 1
sailer, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
overtake, 1
the, 1
little, 1
tartan,, 1
that, 1
with, 1
every, 1
stitch, 1
of, 1
canvas, 1
set, 1
was, 1
flying, 1
before, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
to, 1
Leghorn., 1
Chapter, 1
22., 1
The, 1
Smugglers., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
a, 1
day, 1
on, 1
board, 1
before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
very, 1
clear, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
men, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
his, 1
lot, 1
had, 1
been, 1
cast., 1
Without, 1
having, 1
been, 1
in, 1
the, 1
school, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
master, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
(the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Genoese, 1
tartan), 1
knew, 1
a, 1
smattering, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
tongues, 1
spoken, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shores, 1
of, 1
that, 1
large, 1
lake, 1
called, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Arabic, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Provencal,, 1
and, 1
this,, 1
while, 1
it, 1
spared, 1
him, 1
interpreters,, 1
persons, 1
always, 1
troublesome, 1
and, 1
frequently, 1
indiscreet,, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
great, 1
facilities, 1
of, 1
communication,, 1
either, 1
with, 1
the, 1
vessels, 1
he, 1
met, 1
at, 1
sea,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
small, 1
boats, 1
sailing, 1
along, 1
the, 1
coast,, 1
or, 1
with, 1
the, 1
people, 1
without, 1
name,, 1
country,, 1
or, 1
occupation,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
always, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
the, 1
quays, 1
of, 1
seaports,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
live, 1
by, 1
hidden, 1
and, 1
mysterious, 1
means, 1
which, 1
we, 1
must, 1
suppose, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
direct, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
providence,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
have, 1
no, 1
visible, 1
means, 1
of, 1
support., 1
It, 1
is, 1
fair, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
on, 1
board, 1
a, 1
smuggler., 1
At, 1
first, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
had, 1
received, 1
Dantes, 1
on, 1
board, 1
with, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
distrust., 1
He, 1
was, 1
very, 1
well, 1
known, 1
to, 1
the, 1
customs, 1
officers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coast;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
there, 1
was, 1
between, 1
these, 1
worthies, 1
and, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
perpetual, 1
battle, 1
of, 1
wits,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
at, 1
first, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
might, 1
be, 1
an, 1
emissary, 1
of, 1
these, 1
industrious, 1
guardians, 1
of, 1
rights, 1
and, 1
duties,, 1
who, 1
perhaps, 1
employed, 1
this, 1
ingenious, 1
means, 1
of, 1
learning, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
secrets, 1
of, 1
his, 1
trade., 1
But, 1
the, 1
skilful, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
handled, 1
the, 1
lugger, 1
had, 1
entirely, 1
reassured, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
light, 1
plume, 1
of, 1
smoke, 1
floating, 1
above, 1
the, 1
bastion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
distant, 1
report,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
instantly, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
on, 1
board, 1
his, 1
vessel, 1
one, 1
whose, 1
coming, 1
and, 1
going,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
kings,, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
with, 1
salutes, 1
of, 1
artillery., 1
This, 1
made, 1
him, 1
less, 1
uneasy,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
owned,, 1
than, 1
if, 1
the, 1
new-comer, 1
had, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
customs, 1
officer;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
supposition, 1
also, 1
disappeared, 1
like, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
perfect, 1
tranquillity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
recruit., 1
Edmond, 1
thus, 1
had, 1
the, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
knowing, 1
what, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
was,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
knowing, 1
who, 1
he, 1
was;, 1
and, 1
however, 1
the, 1
old, 1
sailor, 1
and, 1
his, 1
crew, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
"pump", 1
him,, 1
they, 1
extracted, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
from, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
accurate, 1
descriptions, 1
of, 1
Naples, 1
and, 1
Malta,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
stoutly, 1
to, 1
his, 1
first, 1
story., 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
Genoese,, 1
subtle, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
was, 1
duped, 1
by, 1
Edmond,, 1
in, 1
whose, 1
favor, 1
his, 1
mild, 1
demeanor,, 1
his, 1
nautical, 1
skill,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
admirable, 1
dissimulation,, 1
pleaded., 1
Moreover,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Genoese, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
shrewd, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
know, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
what, 1
they, 1
should, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
believe, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
what, 1
they, 1
should, 1
believe., 1
In, 1
this, 1
state, 1
of, 1
mutual, 1
understanding,, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
Leghorn., 1
Here, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
to, 1
undergo, 1
another, 1
trial;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
to, 1
find, 1
out, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
could, 1
recognize, 1
himself,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
own, 1
face, 1
for, 1
fourteen, 1
years., 1
He, 1
had, 1
preserved, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
good, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
what, 1
the, 1
youth, 1
had, 1
been,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
now, 1
to, 1
find, 1
out, 1
what, 1
the, 1
man, 1
had, 1
become., 1
His, 1
comrades, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
his, 1
vow, 1
was, 1
fulfilled., 1
As, 1
he, 1
had, 1
twenty, 1
times, 1
touched, 1
at, 1
Leghorn,, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
a, 1
barber, 1
in, 1
St., 1
Ferdinand, 1
Street;, 1
he, 1
went, 1
there, 1
to, 1
have, 1
his, 1
beard, 1
and, 1
hair, 1
cut., 1
The, 1
barber, 1
gazed, 1
in, 1
amazement, 1
at, 1
this, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
long,, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
black, 1
hair, 1
and, 1
beard,, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
head, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Titian's, 1
portraits., 1
At, 1
this, 1
period, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
fashion, 1
to, 1
wear, 1
so, 1
large, 1
a, 1
beard, 1
and, 1
hair, 1
so, 1
long;, 1
now, 1
a, 1
barber, 1
would, 1
only, 1
be, 1
surprised, 1
if, 1
a, 1
man, 1
gifted, 1
with, 1
such, 1
advantages, 1
should, 1
consent, 1
voluntarily, 1
to, 1
deprive, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
them., 1
The, 1
Leghorn, 1
barber, 1
said, 1
nothing, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
work., 1
When, 1
the, 1
operation, 1
was, 1
concluded,, 1
and, 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
his, 1
chin, 1
was, 1
completely, 1
smooth,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
reduced, 1
to, 1
its, 1
usual, 1
length,, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
hand-glass., 1
He, 1
was, 1
now,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
three-and-thirty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
fourteen, 1
years', 1
imprisonment, 1
had, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
great, 1
transformation, 1
in, 1
his, 1
appearance., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
with, 1
the, 1
round,, 1
open,, 1
smiling, 1
face, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
happy, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
early, 1
paths, 1
of, 1
life, 1
have, 1
been, 1
smooth,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
anticipates, 1
a, 1
future, 1
corresponding, 1
with, 1
his, 1
past., 1
This, 1
was, 1
now, 1
all, 1
changed., 1
The, 1
oval, 1
face, 1
was, 1
lengthened,, 1
his, 1
smiling, 1
mouth, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
marked, 1
lines, 1
which, 1
betoken, 1
resolution;, 1
his, 1
eyebrows, 1
were, 1
arched, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
brow, 1
furrowed, 1
with, 1
thought;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
full, 1
of, 1
melancholy,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
their, 1
depths, 1
occasionally, 1
sparkled, 1
gloomy, 1
fires, 1
of, 1
misanthropy, 1
and, 1
hatred;, 1
his, 1
complexion,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
kept, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1
had, 1
now, 1
that, 1
pale, 1
color, 1
which, 1
produces,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
features, 1
are, 1
encircled, 1
with, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
north;, 1
the, 1
profound, 1
learning, 1
he, 1
had, 1
acquired, 1
had, 1
besides, 1
diffused, 1
over, 1
his, 1
features, 1
a, 1
refined, 1
intellectual, 1
expression;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
also, 1
acquired,, 1
being, 1
naturally, 1
of, 1
a, 1
goodly, 1
stature,, 1
that, 1
vigor, 1
which, 1
a, 1
frame, 1
possesses, 1
which, 1
has, 1
so, 1
long, 1
concentrated, 1
all, 1
its, 1
force, 1
within, 1
itself., 1
To, 1
the, 1
elegance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
and, 1
slight, 1
form, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
the, 1
solidity, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rounded, 1
and, 1
muscular, 1
figure., 1
As, 1
to, 1
his, 1
voice,, 1
prayers,, 1
sobs,, 1
and, 1
imprecations, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
it, 1
so, 1
that, 1
at, 1
times, 1
it, 1
was, 1
of, 1
a, 1
singularly, 1
penetrating, 1
sweetness,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
others, 1
rough, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
hoarse., 1
Moreover,, 1
from, 1
being, 1
so, 1
long, 1
in, 1
twilight, 1
or, 1
darkness,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
had, 1
acquired, 1
the, 1
faculty, 1
of, 1
distinguishing, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
common, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hyena, 1
and, 1
the, 1
wolf., 1
Edmond, 1
smiled, 1
when, 1
he, 1
beheld, 1
himself:, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
that, 1
his, 1
best, 1
friend--if,, 1
indeed,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
any, 1
friend, 1
left--could, 1
recognize, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
himself., 1
The, 1
master, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
very, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
retaining, 1
amongst, 1
his, 1
crew, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
Edmond's, 1
value,, 1
had, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
advance, 1
him, 1
funds, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
future, 1
profits,, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
accepted., 1
His, 1
next, 1
care, 1
on, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
barber's, 1
who, 1
had, 1
achieved, 1
his, 1
first, 1
metamorphosis, 1
was, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
a, 1
shop, 1
and, 1
buy, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
sailor's, 1
suit--a, 1
garb,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
all, 1
know,, 1
very, 1
simple,, 1
and, 1
consisting, 1
of, 1
white, 1
trousers,, 1
a, 1
striped, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
cap., 1
It, 1
was, 1
in, 1
this, 1
costume,, 1
and, 1
bringing, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Jacopo, 1
the, 1
shirt, 1
and, 1
trousers, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lent, 1
him,, 1
that, 1
Edmond, 1
reappeared, 1
before, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lugger,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
made, 1
him, 1
tell, 1
his, 1
story, 1
over, 1
and, 1
over, 1
again, 1
before, 1
he, 1
could, 1
believe, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
recognize, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neat, 1
and, 1
trim, 1
sailor, 1
the, 1
man, 1
with, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
matted, 1
beard,, 1
hair, 1
tangled, 1
with, 1
seaweed,, 1
and, 1
body, 1
soaking, 1
in, 1
seabrine,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
naked, 1
and, 1
nearly, 1
drowned., 1
Attracted, 1
by, 1
his, 1
prepossessing, 1
appearance,, 1
he, 1
renewed, 1
his, 1
offers, 1
of, 1
an, 1
engagement, 1
to, 1
Dantes;, 1
but, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
his, 1
own, 1
projects,, 1
would, 1
not, 1
agree, 1
for, 1
a, 1
longer, 1
time, 1
than, 1
three, 1
months., 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
had, 1
a, 1
very, 1
active, 1
crew,, 1
very, 1
obedient, 1
to, 1
their, 1
captain,, 1
who, 1
lost, 1
as, 1
little, 1
time, 1
as, 1
possible., 1
He, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
been, 1
a, 1
week, 1
at, 1
Leghorn, 1
before, 1
the, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
printed, 1
muslins,, 1
contraband, 1
cottons,, 1
English, 1
powder,, 1
and, 1
tobacco, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
excise, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
to, 1
put, 1
its, 1
mark., 1
The, 1
master, 1
was, 1
to, 1
get, 1
all, 1
this, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Leghorn, 1
free, 1
of, 1
duties,, 1
and, 1
land, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shores, 1
of, 1
Corsica,, 1
where, 1
certain, 1
speculators, 1
undertook, 1
to, 1
forward, 1
the, 1
cargo, 1
to, 1
France., 1
They, 1
sailed;, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
again, 1
cleaving, 1
the, 1
azure, 1
sea, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
first, 1
horizon, 1
of, 1
his, 1
youth,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
dreamed, 1
of, 1
in, 1
prison., 1
He, 1
left, 1
Gorgone, 1
on, 1
his, 1
right, 1
and, 1
La, 1
Pianosa, 1
on, 1
his, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
country, 1
of, 1
Paoli, 1
and, 1
Napoleon., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
going, 1
on, 1
deck,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
always, 1
did, 1
at, 1
an, 1
early, 1
hour,, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
found, 1
Dantes, 1
leaning, 1
against, 1
the, 1
bulwarks, 1
gazing, 1
with, 1
intense, 1
earnestness, 1
at, 1
a, 1
pile, 1
of, 1
granite, 1
rocks,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
rising, 1
sun, 1
tinged, 1
with, 1
rosy, 1
light., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
left, 1
it, 1
three-quarters, 1
of, 1
a, 1
league, 1
to, 1
the, 1
larboard,, 1
and, 1
kept, 1
on, 1
for, 1
Corsica., 1
Dantes, 1
thought,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
so, 1
closely, 1
to, 1
the, 1
island, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
was, 1
so, 1
interesting, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
leap, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
and, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
be, 1
at, 1
the, 1
promised, 1
land., 1
But, 1
then, 1
what, 1
could, 1
he, 1
do, 1
without, 1
instruments, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
his, 1
treasure,, 1
without, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
himself?, 1
Besides,, 1
what, 1
would, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
say?, 1
What, 1
would, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
think?, 1
He, 1
must, 1
wait., 1
Fortunately,, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
how, 1
to, 1
wait;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
waited, 1
fourteen, 1
years, 1
for, 1
his, 1
liberty,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
he, 1
was, 1
free, 1
he, 1
could, 1
wait, 1
at, 1
least, 1
six, 1
months, 1
or, 1
a, 1
year, 1
for, 1
wealth., 1
Would, 1
he, 1
not, 1
have, 1
accepted, 1
liberty, 1
without, 1
riches, 1
if, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
him?, 1
Besides,, 1
were, 1
not, 1
those, 1
riches, 1
chimerical?--offspring, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1
had, 1
they, 1
not, 1
died, 1
with, 1
him?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada, 1
was, 1
singularly, 1
circumstantial,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
repeated, 1
it, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
from, 1
one, 1
end, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
forgotten, 1
a, 1
word., 1
Evening, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
Edmond, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
island, 1
tinged, 1
with, 1
the, 1
shades, 1
of, 1
twilight,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
disappear, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
from, 1
all, 1
eyes, 1
but, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
for, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
vision, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gloom, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prison,, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
it, 1
last, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
alone, 1
upon, 1
deck., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morn, 1
broke, 1
off, 1
the, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
Aleria;, 1
all, 1
day, 1
they, 1
coasted,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
saw, 1
fires, 1
lighted, 1
on, 1
land;, 1
the, 1
position, 1
of, 1
these, 1
was, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
for, 1
landing,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
ship's, 1
lantern, 1
was, 1
hung, 1
up, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mast-head, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
streamer,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
came, 1
to, 1
within, 1
a, 1
gunshot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shore., 1
Dantes, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
had,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
neared, 1
the, 1
land,, 1
mounted, 1
two, 1
small, 1
culverins,, 1
which,, 1
without, 1
making, 1
much, 1
noise,, 1
can, 1
throw, 1
a, 1
four, 1
ounce, 1
ball, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
paces, 1
or, 1
so., 1
But, 1
on, 1
this, 1
occasion, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
was, 1
superfluous,, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
proceeded, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
smoothness, 1
and, 1
politeness., 1
Four, 1
shallops, 1
came, 1
off, 1
with, 1
very, 1
little, 1
noise, 1
alongside, 1
the, 1
lugger,, 1
which,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
in, 1
acknowledgement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
compliment,, 1
lowered, 1
her, 1
own, 1
shallop, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
five, 1
boats, 1
worked, 1
so, 1
well, 1
that, 1
by, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
all, 1
the, 1
cargo, 1
was, 1
out, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
and, 1
on, 1
terra, 1
firma., 1
The, 1
same, 1
night,, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
regularity, 1
was, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia,, 1
the, 1
profits, 1
were, 1
divided,, 1
and, 1
each, 1
man, 1
had, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
Tuscan, 1
livres,, 1
or, 1
about, 1
eighty, 1
francs., 1
But, 1
the, 1
voyage, 1
was, 1
not, 1
ended., 1
They, 1
turned, 1
the, 1
bowsprit, 1
towards, 1
Sardinia,, 1
where, 1
they, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
take, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cargo,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
replace, 1
what, 1
had, 1
been, 1
discharged., 1
The, 1
second, 1
operation, 1
was, 1
as, 1
successful, 1
as, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
was, 1
in, 1
luck., 1
This, 1
new, 1
cargo, 1
was, 1
destined, 1
for, 1
the, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Duchy, 1
of, 1
Lucca,, 1
and, 1
consisted, 1
almost, 1
entirely, 1
of, 1
Havana, 1
cigars,, 1
sherry,, 1
and, 1
Malaga, 1
wines., 1
There, 1
they, 1
had, 1
a, 1
bit, 1
of, 1
a, 1
skirmish, 1
in, 1
getting, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
duties;, 1
the, 1
excise, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
truth,, 1
the, 1
everlasting, 1
enemy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia., 1
A, 1
customs, 1
officer, 1
was, 1
laid, 1
low,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
sailors, 1
wounded;, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
a, 1
ball, 1
having, 1
touched, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
left, 1
shoulder., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
glad, 1
of, 1
this, 1
affray,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
pleased, 1
at, 1
being, 1
wounded,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
were, 1
rude, 1
lessons, 1
which, 1
taught, 1
him, 1
with, 1
what, 1
eye, 1
he, 1
could, 1
view, 1
danger,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
what, 1
endurance, 1
he, 1
could, 1
bear, 1
suffering., 1
He, 1
had, 1
contemplated, 1
danger, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
wounded, 1
had, 1
exclaimed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
great, 1
philosopher,, 1
"Pain,, 1
thou, 1
art, 1
not, 1
an, 1
evil.", 1
He, 1
had,, 1
moreover,, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
customs, 1
officer, 1
wounded, 1
to, 1
death,, 1
and,, 1
whether, 1
from, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
produced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
encounter,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
chill, 1
of, 1
human, 1
sentiment,, 1
this, 1
sight, 1
had, 1
made, 1
but, 1
slight, 1
impression, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
way, 1
he, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
follow,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
moving, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
end, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
achieve;, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fair, 1
way, 1
of, 1
petrifying, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bosom., 1
Jacopo,, 1
seeing, 1
him, 1
fall,, 1
had, 1
believed, 1
him, 1
killed,, 1
and, 1
rushing, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
raised, 1
him, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
attended, 1
to, 1
him, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
devoted, 1
comrade., 1
This, 1
world, 1
was, 1
not, 1
then, 1
so, 1
good, 1
as, 1
Doctor, 1
Pangloss, 1
believed, 1
it,, 1
neither, 1
was, 1
it, 1
so, 1
wicked, 1
as, 1
Dantes, 1
thought, 1
it,, 1
since, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
expect, 1
from, 1
his, 1
comrade, 1
but, 1
the, 1
inheritance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
share, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prize-money,, 1
manifested, 1
so, 1
much, 1
sorrow, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
fall., 1
Fortunately,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
only, 1
wounded,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
certain, 1
herbs, 1
gathered, 1
at, 1
certain, 1
seasons,, 1
and, 1
sold, 1
to, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
by, 1
the, 1
old, 1
Sardinian, 1
women,, 1
the, 1
wound, 1
soon, 1
closed., 1
Edmond, 1
then, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
try, 1
Jacopo,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
his, 1
attention, 1
a, 1
share, 1
of, 1
his, 1
prize-money,, 1
but, 1
Jacopo, 1
refused, 1
it, 1
indignantly., 1
As, 1
a, 1
result, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sympathetic, 1
devotion, 1
which, 1
Jacopo, 1
had, 1
from, 1
the, 1
first, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
Edmond,, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
was, 1
moved, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
affection., 1
But, 1
this, 1
sufficed, 1
for, 1
Jacopo,, 1
who, 1
instinctively, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
superiority, 1
of, 1
position--a, 1
superiority, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
all, 1
others., 1
And, 1
from, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
showed, 1
him, 1
was, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
the, 1
brave, 1
seaman., 1
Then, 1
in, 1
the, 1
long, 1
days, 1
on, 1
board, 1
ship,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
vessel,, 1
gliding, 1
on, 1
with, 1
security, 1
over, 1
the, 1
azure, 1
sea,, 1
required, 1
no, 1
care, 1
but, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
helmsman,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
favorable, 1
winds, 1
that, 1
swelled, 1
her, 1
sails,, 1
Edmond,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
chart, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
became, 1
the, 1
instructor, 1
of, 1
Jacopo,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his, 1
tutor., 1
He, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
bearings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coast,, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
variations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
compass,, 1
and, 1
taught, 1
him, 1
to, 1
read, 1
in, 1
that, 1
vast, 1
book, 1
opened, 1
over, 1
our, 1
heads, 1
which, 1
they, 1
call, 1
heaven,, 1
and, 1
where, 1
God, 1
writes, 1
in, 1
azure, 1
with, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
diamonds., 1
And, 1
when, 1
Jacopo, 1
inquired, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
teaching, 1
all, 1
these, 1
things, 1
to, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
sailor, 1
like, 1
me?", 1
Edmond, 1
replied,, 1
"Who, 1
knows?, 1
You, 1
may, 1
one, 1
day, 1
be, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
a, 1
vessel., 1
Your, 1
fellow-countryman,, 1
Bonaparte,, 1
became, 1
emperor.", 1
We, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
Jacopo, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Corsican., 1
Two, 1
months, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
elapsed, 1
in, 1
these, 1
trips,, 1
and, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
become, 1
as, 1
skilful, 1
a, 1
coaster, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
hardy, 1
seaman;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
an, 1
acquaintance, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
on, 1
the, 1
coast,, 1
and, 1
learned, 1
all, 1
the, 1
Masonic, 1
signs, 1
by, 1
which, 1
these, 1
half, 1
pirates, 1
recognize, 1
each, 1
other., 1
He, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
and, 1
re-passed, 1
his, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
twenty, 1
times,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
once, 1
had, 1
he, 1
found, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
landing, 1
there., 1
He, 1
then, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
resolution., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
his, 1
engagement, 1
with, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
ended,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
hire, 1
a, 1
small, 1
vessel, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
account--for, 1
in, 1
his, 1
several, 1
voyages, 1
he, 1
had, 1
amassed, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
piastres--and, 1
under, 1
some, 1
pretext, 1
land, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
free, 1
to, 1
make, 1
his, 1
researches,, 1
not, 1
perhaps, 1
entirely, 1
at, 1
liberty,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
doubtless, 1
watched, 1
by, 1
those, 1
who, 1
accompanied, 1
him., 1
But, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world, 1
we, 1
must, 1
risk, 1
something., 1
Prison, 1
had, 1
made, 1
Edmond, 1
prudent,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
running, 1
no, 1
risk, 1
whatever., 1
But, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
he, 1
rack, 1
his, 1
imagination;, 1
fertile, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
devise, 1
any, 1
plan, 1
for, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
island, 1
without, 1
companionship., 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
tossed, 1
about, 1
on, 1
these, 1
doubts, 1
and, 1
wishes,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
great, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
very, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
retaining, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
service,, 1
took, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
one, 1
evening, 1
and, 1
led, 1
him, 1
to, 1
a, 1
tavern, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
del', 1
Oglio,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
leading, 1
smugglers, 1
of, 1
Leghorn, 1
used, 1
to, 1
congregate, 1
and, 1
discuss, 1
affairs, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
their, 1
trade., 1
Already, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
visited, 1
this, 1
maritime, 1
Bourse, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
all, 1
these, 1
hardy, 1
free-traders,, 1
who, 1
supplied, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
coast, 1
for, 1
nearly, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
leagues, 1
in, 1
extent,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
asked, 1
himself, 1
what, 1
power, 1
might, 1
not, 1
that, 1
man, 1
attain, 1
who, 1
should, 1
give, 1
the, 1
impulse, 1
of, 1
his, 1
will, 1
to, 1
all, 1
these, 1
contrary, 1
and, 1
diverging, 1
minds., 1
This, 1
time, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
matter, 1
that, 1
was, 1
under, 1
discussion,, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
laden, 1
with, 1
Turkey, 1
carpets,, 1
stuffs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Levant,, 1
and, 1
cashmeres., 1
It, 1
was, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
find, 1
some, 1
neutral, 1
ground, 1
on, 1
which, 1
an, 1
exchange, 1
could, 1
be, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
to, 1
try, 1
and, 1
land, 1
these, 1
goods, 1
on, 1
the, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
France., 1
If, 1
the, 1
venture, 1
was, 1
successful, 1
the, 1
profit, 1
would, 1
be, 1
enormous,, 1
there, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
gain, 1
of, 1
fifty, 1
or, 1
sixty, 1
piastres, 1
each, 1
for, 1
the, 1
crew., 1
The, 1
patron, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
proposed, 1
as, 1
a, 1
place, 1
of, 1
landing, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
which, 1
being, 1
completely, 1
deserted,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
neither, 1
soldiers, 1
nor, 1
revenue, 1
officers,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean, 1
since, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heathen, 1
Olympus, 1
by, 1
Mercury,, 1
the, 1
god, 1
of, 1
merchants, 1
and, 1
robbers,, 1
classes, 1
of, 1
mankind, 1
which, 1
we, 1
in, 1
modern, 1
times, 1
have, 1
separated, 1
if, 1
not, 1
made, 1
distinct,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
antiquity, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
have, 1
included, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
category., 1
At, 1
the, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
Dantes, 1
started, 1
with, 1
joy;, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
his, 1
emotion,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
a, 1
turn, 1
around, 1
the, 1
smoky, 1
tavern,, 1
where, 1
all, 1
the, 1
languages, 1
of, 1
the, 1
known, 1
world, 1
were, 1
jumbled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
lingua, 1
franca., 1
When, 1
he, 1
again, 1
joined, 1
the, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
discussing, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
decided, 1
that, 1
they, 1
should, 1
touch, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
set, 1
out, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
night., 1
Edmond,, 1
being, 1
consulted,, 1
was, 1
of, 1
opinion, 1
that, 1
the, 1
island, 1
afforded, 1
every, 1
possible, 1
security,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
great, 1
enterprises, 1
to, 1
be, 1
well, 1
done, 1
should, 1
be, 1
done, 1
quickly., 1
Nothing, 1
then, 1
was, 1
altered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
plan,, 1
and, 1
orders, 1
were, 1
given, 1
to, 1
get, 1
under, 1
weigh, 1
next, 1
night,, 1
and,, 1
wind, 1
and, 1
weather, 1
permitting,, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
neutral, 1
island, 1
by, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day., 1
Chapter, 1
23., 1
The, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Thus,, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
unexpected, 1
strokes, 1
of, 1
fortune, 1
which, 1
sometimes, 1
befall, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
been, 1
the, 1
victims, 1
of, 1
an, 1
evil, 1
destiny,, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
for,, 1
by, 1
simple, 1
and, 1
natural, 1
means,, 1
and, 1
land, 1
on, 1
the, 1
island, 1
without, 1
incurring, 1
any, 1
suspicion., 1
One, 1
night, 1
more, 1
and, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way., 1
The, 1
night, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
feverish, 1
distraction,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
its, 1
progress, 1
visions, 1
good, 1
and, 1
evil, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
Dantes', 1
mind., 1
If, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada's, 1
letter, 1
written, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
in, 1
characters, 1
of, 1
flame--if, 1
he, 1
slept, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
wildest, 1
dreams, 1
haunted, 1
his, 1
brain., 1
He, 1
ascended, 1
into, 1
grottos, 1
paved, 1
with, 1
emeralds,, 1
with, 1
panels, 1
of, 1
rubies,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
glowing, 1
with, 1
diamond, 1
stalactites., 1
Pearls, 1
fell, 1
drop, 1
by, 1
drop,, 1
as, 1
subterranean, 1
waters, 1
filter, 1
in, 1
their, 1
caves., 1
Edmond,, 1
amazed,, 1
wonderstruck,, 1
filled, 1
his, 1
pockets, 1
with, 1
the, 1
radiant, 1
gems, 1
and, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
daylight,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
his, 1
prizes, 1
had, 1
all, 1
changed, 1
into, 1
common, 1
pebbles., 1
He, 1
then, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
re-enter, 1
the, 1
marvellous, 1
grottos,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
had, 1
suddenly, 1
receded,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
the, 1
path, 1
became, 1
a, 1
labyrinth,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
vanished,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
he, 1
tax, 1
his, 1
memory, 1
for, 1
the, 1
magic, 1
and, 1
mysterious, 1
word, 1
which, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
caverns, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Baba, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Arabian, 1
fisherman., 1
All, 1
was, 1
useless,, 1
the, 1
treasure, 1
disappeared,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
again, 1
reverted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
genii, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
had, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
it, 1
off., 1
The, 1
day, 1
came, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
feverish, 1
as, 1
the, 1
night, 1
had, 1
been,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
brought, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
imagination,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
then, 1
enabled, 1
to, 1
arrange, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
which, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
been, 1
vague, 1
and, 1
unsettled, 1
in, 1
his, 1
brain., 1
Night, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
it, 1
the, 1
preparation, 1
for, 1
departure,, 1
and, 1
these, 1
preparations, 1
served, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
Dantes', 1
agitation., 1
He, 1
had, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
assumed, 1
such, 1
authority, 1
over, 1
his, 1
companions, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
like, 1
a, 1
commander, 1
on, 1
board;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
his, 1
orders, 1
were, 1
always, 1
clear,, 1
distinct,, 1
and, 1
easy, 1
of, 1
execution,, 1
his, 1
comrades, 1
obeyed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
celerity, 1
and, 1
pleasure., 1
The, 1
old, 1
patron, 1
did, 1
not, 1
interfere,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
too, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
superiority, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
over, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
and, 1
himself., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
his, 1
natural, 1
successor,, 1
and, 1
regretted, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
a, 1
daughter,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
bound, 1
Edmond, 1
to, 1
him, 1
by, 1
a, 1
more, 1
secure, 1
alliance., 1
At, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
all, 1
was, 1
ready,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
past, 1
seven, 1
they, 1
doubled, 1
the, 1
lighthouse, 1
just, 1
as, 1
the, 1
beacon, 1
was, 1
kindled., 1
The, 1
sea, 1
was, 1
calm,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
breeze, 1
from, 1
the, 1
south-east,, 1
they, 1
sailed, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
blue, 1
sky,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
God, 1
also, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
in, 1
turn, 1
his, 1
beacon, 1
lights,, 1
each, 1
of, 1
which, 1
is, 1
a, 1
world., 1
Dantes, 1
told, 1
them, 1
that, 1
all, 1
hands, 1
might, 1
turn, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
would, 1
take, 1
the, 1
helm., 1
When, 1
the, 1
Maltese, 1
(for, 1
so, 1
they, 1
called, 1
Dantes), 1
had, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
sufficient,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
went, 1
to, 1
their, 1
bunks, 1
contentedly., 1
This, 1
frequently, 1
happened., 1
Dantes,, 1
cast, 1
from, 1
solitude, 1
into, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
frequently, 1
experienced, 1
an, 1
imperious, 1
desire, 1
for, 1
solitude;, 1
and, 1
what, 1
solitude, 1
is, 1
more, 1
complete,, 1
or, 1
more, 1
poetical,, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
ship, 1
floating, 1
in, 1
isolation, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
during, 1
the, 1
obscurity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
immensity,, 1
and, 1
under, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
heaven?, 1
Now, 1
this, 1
solitude, 1
was, 1
peopled, 1
with, 1
his, 1
thoughts,, 1
the, 1
night, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
by, 1
his, 1
illusions,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
animated, 1
by, 1
his, 1
anticipations., 1
When, 1
the, 1
patron, 1
awoke,, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
hurrying, 1
on, 1
with, 1
every, 1
sail, 1
set,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
sail, 1
full, 1
with, 1
the, 1
breeze., 1
They, 1
were, 1
making, 1
nearly, 1
ten, 1
knots, 1
an, 1
hour., 1
The, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
loomed, 1
large, 1
in, 1
the, 1
horizon., 1
Edmond, 1
resigned, 1
the, 1
lugger, 1
to, 1
the, 1
master's, 1
care,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
and, 1
lay, 1
down, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hammock;, 1
but,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sleepless, 1
night,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
close, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
came, 1
on, 1
deck,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
double, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba., 1
They, 1
were, 1
just, 1
abreast, 1
of, 1
Mareciana,, 1
and, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
flat, 1
but, 1
verdant, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Pianosa., 1
The, 1
peak, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
reddened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
burning, 1
sun,, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
against, 1
the, 1
azure, 1
sky., 1
Dantes, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
helmsman, 1
to, 1
put, 1
down, 1
his, 1
helm,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
La, 1
Pianosa, 1
to, 1
starboard,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
shorten, 1
his, 1
course, 1
by, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
knots., 1
About, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
the, 1
island, 1
was, 1
distinct,, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
on, 1
it, 1
was, 1
plainly, 1
perceptible,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
that, 1
clearness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
atmosphere, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
light, 1
which, 1
the, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
cast, 1
at, 1
its, 1
setting., 1
Edmond, 1
gazed, 1
very, 1
earnestly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
rocks, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
out, 1
all, 1
the, 1
variety, 1
of, 1
twilight, 1
colors,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
brightest, 1
pink, 1
to, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
blue;, 1
and, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
his, 1
cheeks, 1
flushed,, 1
his, 1
brow, 1
darkened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
mist, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
Never, 1
did, 1
a, 1
gamester,, 1
whose, 1
whole, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
staked, 1
on, 1
one, 1
cast, 1
of, 1
the, 1
die,, 1
experience, 1
the, 1
anguish, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
in, 1
his, 1
paroxysms, 1
of, 1
hope., 1
Night, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
they, 1
anchored., 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
was, 1
first, 1
at, 1
the, 1
rendezvous., 1
In, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
command, 1
over, 1
himself,, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
restrain, 1
his, 1
impetuosity., 1
He, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
jump, 1
on, 1
shore;, 1
and, 1
had, 1
he, 1
dared,, 1
he, 1
would,, 1
like, 1
Lucius, 1
Brutus,, 1
have, 1
"kissed, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
earth.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
dark,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
rose, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
whose, 1
every, 1
wave, 1
she, 1
silvered,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
"ascending, 1
high,", 1
played, 1
in, 1
floods, 1
of, 1
pale, 1
light, 1
on, 1
the, 1
rocky, 1
hills, 1
of, 1
this, 1
second, 1
Pelion., 1
The, 1
island, 1
was, 1
familiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia,--it, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
her, 1
regular, 1
haunts., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
his, 1
voyage, 1
to, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Levant,, 1
but, 1
never, 1
touched, 1
at, 1
it., 1
He, 1
questioned, 1
Jacopo., 1
"Where, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
night?", 1
he, 1
inquired., 1
"Why,, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
tartan,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
sailor., 1
"Should, 1
we, 1
not, 1
do, 1
better, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grottos?", 1
"What, 1
grottos?", 1
"Why,, 1
the, 1
grottos--caves, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
of, 1
any, 1
grottos,", 1
replied, 1
Jacopo., 1
The, 1
cold, 1
sweat, 1
sprang, 1
forth, 1
on, 1
Dantes', 1
brow., 1
"What,, 1
are, 1
there, 1
no, 1
grottos, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"None.", 1
For, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
speechless;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
these, 1
caves, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
filled, 1
up, 1
by, 1
some, 1
accident,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
stopped, 1
up,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
greater, 1
security,, 1
by, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada., 1
The, 1
point, 1
was,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
hidden, 1
entrance., 1
It, 1
was, 1
useless, 1
to, 1
search, 1
at, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
therefore, 1
delayed, 1
all, 1
investigation, 1
until, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
Besides,, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
made, 1
half, 1
a, 1
league, 1
out, 1
at, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
which, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
signal,, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
business, 1
had, 1
come., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
that, 1
now, 1
arrived,, 1
assured, 1
by, 1
the, 1
answering, 1
signal, 1
that, 1
all, 1
was, 1
well,, 1
soon, 1
came, 1
in, 1
sight,, 1
white, 1
and, 1
silent, 1
as, 1
a, 1
phantom,, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
anchor, 1
within, 1
a, 1
cable's, 1
length, 1
of, 1
shore., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
landing, 1
began., 1
Dantes, 1
reflected,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
worked,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shout, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
which,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
evoke, 1
from, 1
all, 1
these, 1
men,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
one, 1
unchanging, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
pervaded, 1
his, 1
heart;, 1
but,, 1
far, 1
from, 1
disclosing, 1
this, 1
precious, 1
secret,, 1
he, 1
almost, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
said, 1
too, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
his, 1
restlessness, 1
and, 1
continual, 1
questions,, 1
his, 1
minute, 1
observations, 1
and, 1
evident, 1
pre-occupation,, 1
aroused, 1
suspicions., 1
Fortunately,, 1
as, 1
regarded, 1
this, 1
circumstance, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
his, 1
painful, 1
past, 1
gave, 1
to, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
an, 1
indelible, 1
sadness,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
glimmerings, 1
of, 1
gayety, 1
seen, 1
beneath, 1
this, 1
cloud, 1
were, 1
indeed, 1
but, 1
transitory., 1
No, 1
one, 1
had, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
suspicion;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
fowling-piece,, 1
powder,, 1
and, 1
shot,, 1
Dantes, 1
declared, 1
his, 1
intention, 1
to, 1
go, 1
and, 1
kill, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
goats, 1
that, 1
were, 1
seen, 1
springing, 1
from, 1
rock, 1
to, 1
rock,, 1
his, 1
wish, 1
was, 1
construed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
love, 1
of, 1
sport,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
for, 1
solitude., 1
However,, 1
Jacopo, 1
insisted, 1
on, 1
following, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
oppose, 1
this,, 1
fearing, 1
if, 1
he, 1
did, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
incur, 1
distrust., 1
Scarcely,, 1
however,, 1
had, 1
they, 1
gone, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
league, 1
when,, 1
having, 1
killed, 1
a, 1
kid,, 1
he, 1
begged, 1
Jacopo, 1
to, 1
take, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
comrades,, 1
and, 1
request, 1
them, 1
to, 1
cook, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
let, 1
him, 1
know, 1
by, 1
firing, 1
a, 1
gun., 1
This, 1
and, 1
some, 1
dried, 1
fruits, 1
and, 1
a, 1
flask, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Pulciano,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
bill, 1
of, 1
fare., 1
Dantes, 1
went, 1
on,, 1
looking, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
behind, 1
and, 1
around, 1
about, 1
him., 1
Having, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
he, 1
saw,, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
feet, 1
beneath, 1
him,, 1
his, 1
companions,, 1
whom, 1
Jacopo, 1
had, 1
rejoined,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
were, 1
all, 1
busy, 1
preparing, 1
the, 1
repast, 1
which, 1
Edmond's, 1
skill, 1
as, 1
a, 1
marksman, 1
had, 1
augmented, 1
with, 1
a, 1
capital, 1
dish., 1
Edmond, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
them, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sad, 1
and, 1
gentle, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
superior, 1
to, 1
his, 1
fellows., 1
"In, 1
two, 1
hours', 1
time,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"these, 1
persons, 1
will, 1
depart, 1
richer, 1
by, 1
fifty, 1
piastres, 1
each,, 1
to, 1
go, 1
and, 1
risk, 1
their, 1
lives, 1
again, 1
by, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
fifty, 1
more;, 1
then, 1
they, 1
will, 1
return, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
six, 1
hundred, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
waste, 1
this, 1
treasure, 1
in, 1
some, 1
city, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
sultans, 1
and, 1
the, 1
insolence, 1
of, 1
nabobs., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
hope, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
despise, 1
their, 1
riches,, 1
which, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
me, 1
contemptible., 1
Yet, 1
perchance, 1
to-morrow, 1
deception, 1
will, 1
so, 1
act, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall,, 1
on, 1
compulsion,, 1
consider, 1
such, 1
a, 1
contemptible, 1
possession, 1
as, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
happiness., 1
Oh,, 1
no!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Edmond,, 1
"that, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be., 1
The, 1
wise,, 1
unerring, 1
Faria, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
mistaken, 1
in, 1
this, 1
one, 1
thing., 1
Besides,, 1
it, 1
were, 1
better, 1
to, 1
die, 1
than, 1
to, 1
continue, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
this, 1
low, 1
and, 1
wretched, 1
life.", 1
Thus, 1
Dantes,, 1
who, 1
but, 1
three, 1
months, 1
before, 1
had, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
but, 1
liberty, 1
had, 1
now, 1
not, 1
liberty, 1
enough,, 1
and, 1
panted, 1
for, 1
wealth., 1
The, 1
cause, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
Dantes,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
providence,, 1
who,, 1
while, 1
limiting, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
man,, 1
has, 1
filled, 1
him, 1
with, 1
boundless, 1
desires., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
cleft, 1
between, 1
two, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
rock,, 1
following, 1
a, 1
path, 1
worn, 1
by, 1
a, 1
torrent,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
human, 1
probability,, 1
human, 1
foot, 1
had, 1
never, 1
before, 1
trod,, 1
Dantes, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
supposed, 1
the, 1
grottos, 1
must, 1
have, 1
existed., 1
Keeping, 1
along, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
and, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
smallest, 1
object, 1
with, 1
serious, 1
attention,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
could, 1
trace,, 1
on, 1
certain, 1
rocks,, 1
marks, 1
made, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
man., 1
Time,, 1
which, 1
encrusts, 1
all, 1
physical, 1
substances, 1
with, 1
its, 1
mossy, 1
mantle,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
invests, 1
all, 1
things, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
with, 1
forgetfulness,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
respected, 1
these, 1
signs,, 1
which, 1
apparently, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
with, 1
some, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
regularity,, 1
and, 1
probably, 1
with, 1
a, 1
definite, 1
purpose., 1
Occasionally, 1
the, 1
marks, 1
were, 1
hidden, 1
under, 1
tufts, 1
of, 1
myrtle,, 1
which, 1
spread, 1
into, 1
large, 1
bushes, 1
laden, 1
with, 1
blossoms,, 1
or, 1
beneath, 1
parasitical, 1
lichen., 1
So, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
to, 1
separate, 1
the, 1
branches, 1
or, 1
brush, 1
away, 1
the, 1
moss, 1
to, 1
know, 1
where, 1
the, 1
guide-marks, 1
were., 1
The, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
marks, 1
renewed, 1
Edmond, 1
fondest, 1
hopes., 1
Might, 1
it, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
cardinal, 1
himself, 1
who, 1
had, 1
first, 1
traced, 1
them,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
serve, 1
as, 1
a, 1
guide, 1
for, 1
his, 1
nephew, 1
in, 1
the, 1
event, 1
of, 1
a, 1
catastrophe,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
foresee, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
complete., 1
This, 1
solitary, 1
place, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1
suited, 1
to, 1
the, 1
requirements, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
burying, 1
treasure., 1
Only,, 1
might, 1
not, 1
these, 1
betraying, 1
marks, 1
have, 1
attracted, 1
other, 1
eyes, 1
than, 1
those, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
were, 1
made?, 1
and, 1
had, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
wondrous, 1
island, 1
indeed, 1
faithfully, 1
guarded, 1
its, 1
precious, 1
secret?, 1
It, 1
seemed,, 1
however,, 1
to, 1
Edmond,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
hidden, 1
from, 1
his, 1
comrades, 1
by, 1
the, 1
inequalities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
that, 1
at, 1
sixty, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
the, 1
harbor, 1
the, 1
marks, 1
ceased;, 1
nor, 1
did, 1
they, 1
terminate, 1
at, 1
any, 1
grotto., 1
A, 1
large, 1
round, 1
rock,, 1
placed, 1
solidly, 1
on, 1
its, 1
base,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
spot, 1
to, 1
which, 1
they, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
lead., 1
Edmond, 1
concluded, 1
that, 1
perhaps, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
having, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
route, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
explored, 1
its, 1
beginning,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
and, 1
retraced, 1
his, 1
steps., 1
Meanwhile, 1
his, 1
comrades, 1
had, 1
prepared, 1
the, 1
repast,, 1
had, 1
got, 1
some, 1
water, 1
from, 1
a, 1
spring,, 1
spread, 1
out, 1
the, 1
fruit, 1
and, 1
bread,, 1
and, 1
cooked, 1
the, 1
kid., 1
Just, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
dainty, 1
animal, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spit,, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
Edmond, 1
springing, 1
with, 1
the, 1
boldness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
chamois, 1
from, 1
rock, 1
to, 1
rock,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
fired, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
agreed, 1
upon., 1
The, 1
sportsman, 1
instantly, 1
changed, 1
his, 1
direction,, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
quickly, 1
towards, 1
them., 1
But, 1
even, 1
while, 1
they, 1
watched, 1
his, 1
daring, 1
progress,, 1
Edmond's, 1
foot, 1
slipped,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
stagger, 1
on, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rock, 1
and, 1
disappear., 1
They, 1
all, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
all, 1
loved, 1
Edmond, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
superiority;, 1
yet, 1
Jacopo, 1
reached, 1
him, 1
first., 1
He, 1
found, 1
Edmond, 1
lying, 1
prone,, 1
bleeding,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
senseless., 1
He, 1
had, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
a, 1
declivity, 1
of, 1
twelve, 1
or, 1
fifteen, 1
feet., 1
They, 1
poured, 1
a, 1
little, 1
rum, 1
down, 1
his, 1
throat,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
remedy, 1
which, 1
had, 1
before, 1
been, 1
so, 1
beneficial, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
same, 1
effect, 1
as, 1
formerly., 1
Edmond, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
complained, 1
of, 1
great, 1
pain, 1
in, 1
his, 1
knee,, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
heaviness, 1
in, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
severe, 1
pains, 1
in, 1
his, 1
loins., 1
They, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
shore;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
they, 1
touched, 1
him,, 1
although, 1
under, 1
Jacopo's, 1
directions,, 1
he, 1
declared,, 1
with, 1
heavy, 1
groans,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
bear, 1
to, 1
be, 1
moved., 1
It, 1
may, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
now, 1
think, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dinner,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
insisted, 1
that, 1
his, 1
comrades,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
his, 1
reasons, 1
for, 1
fasting,, 1
should, 1
have, 1
their, 1
meal., 1
As, 1
for, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
need, 1
of, 1
a, 1
little, 1
rest,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
when, 1
they, 1
returned, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
easier., 1
The, 1
sailors, 1
did, 1
not, 1
require, 1
much, 1
urging., 1
They, 1
were, 1
hungry,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
the, 1
roasted, 1
kid, 1
was, 1
very, 1
savory,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
tars, 1
are, 1
not, 1
very, 1
ceremonious., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
they, 1
returned., 1
All, 1
that, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
do, 1
was, 1
to, 1
drag, 1
himself, 1
about, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
paces, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
lean, 1
against, 1
a, 1
moss-grown, 1
rock., 1
But,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
growing, 1
easier,, 1
Dantes', 1
pains, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
in, 1
violence., 1
The, 1
old, 1
patron,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
sail, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
land, 1
his, 1
cargo, 1
on, 1
the, 1
frontiers, 1
of, 1
Piedmont, 1
and, 1
France,, 1
between, 1
Nice, 1
and, 1
Frejus,, 1
urged, 1
Dantes, 1
to, 1
try, 1
and, 1
rise., 1
Edmond, 1
made, 1
great, 1
exertions, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
comply;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
each, 1
effort, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
back,, 1
moaning, 1
and, 1
turning, 1
pale., 1
"He, 1
has, 1
broken, 1
his, 1
ribs,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
commander,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice., 1
"No, 1
matter;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
fellow,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
must, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
him., 1
We, 1
will, 1
try, 1
and, 1
carry, 1
him, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
tartan.", 1
Dantes, 1
declared,, 1
however,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
die, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
than, 1
undergo, 1
the, 1
agony, 1
which, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
movement, 1
cost, 1
him., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
"let, 1
what, 1
may, 1
happen,, 1
it, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
be, 1
said, 1
that, 1
we, 1
deserted, 1
a, 1
good, 1
comrade, 1
like, 1
you., 1
We, 1
will, 1
not, 1
go, 1
till, 1
evening.", 1
This, 1
very, 1
much, 1
astonished, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
although,, 1
not, 1
one, 1
opposed, 1
it., 1
The, 1
patron, 1
was, 1
so, 1
strict, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
they, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
give, 1
up, 1
an, 1
enterprise,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
delay, 1
in, 1
its, 1
execution., 1
Dantes, 1
would, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
that, 1
any, 1
such, 1
infraction, 1
of, 1
regular, 1
and, 1
proper, 1
rules, 1
should, 1
be, 1
made, 1
in, 1
his, 1
favor., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
awkward,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
just, 1
that, 1
I, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
penalty, 1
of, 1
my, 1
clumsiness., 1
Leave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
small, 1
supply, 1
of, 1
biscuit,, 1
a, 1
gun,, 1
powder,, 1
and, 1
balls,, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
the, 1
kids, 1
or, 1
defend, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
need,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
pickaxe,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
build, 1
a, 1
shelter, 1
if, 1
you, 1
delay, 1
in, 1
coming, 1
back, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
you'll, 1
die, 1
of, 1
hunger,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
patron., 1
"I, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
was, 1
Edmond, 1
reply,, 1
"than, 1
suffer, 1
the, 1
inexpressible, 1
agonies, 1
which, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
movement, 1
causes, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
patron, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
vessel,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
rolling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
swell, 1
in, 1
the, 1
little, 1
harbor,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
sails, 1
partly, 1
set,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
for, 1
sea, 1
when, 1
her, 1
toilet, 1
should, 1
be, 1
completed., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
we, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
Maltese?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"We, 1
cannot, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
here, 1
so,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
we, 1
cannot, 1
stay.", 1
"Go,, 1
go!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Dantes., 1
"We, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
absent, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
week,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
"and, 1
then, 1
we, 1
must, 1
run, 1
out, 1
of, 1
our, 1
course, 1
to, 1
come, 1
here, 1
and, 1
take, 1
you, 1
up, 1
again.", 1
"Why,", 1
said, 1
Dantes,, 1
"if, 1
in, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
days, 1
you, 1
hail, 1
any, 1
fishing-boat,, 1
desire, 1
them, 1
to, 1
come, 1
here, 1
to, 1
me., 1
I, 1
will, 1
pay, 1
twenty-five, 1
piastres, 1
for, 1
my, 1
passage, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Leghorn., 1
If, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
come, 1
across, 1
one,, 1
return, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
patron, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Listen,, 1
Captain, 1
Baldi;, 1
there's, 1
one, 1
way, 1
of, 1
settling, 1
this,", 1
said, 1
Jacopo., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
go,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
stay, 1
and, 1
take, 1
care, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wounded, 1
man.", 1
"And, 1
give, 1
up, 1
your, 1
share, 1
of, 1
the, 1
venture,", 1
said, 1
Edmond,, 1
"to, 1
remain, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Jacopo,, 1
"and, 1
without, 1
any, 1
hesitation.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
good, 1
fellow, 1
and, 1
a, 1
kind-hearted, 1
messmate,", 1
replied, 1
Edmond,, 1
"and, 1
heaven, 1
will, 1
recompense, 1
you, 1
for, 1
your, 1
generous, 1
intentions;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
any, 1
one, 1
to, 1
stay, 1
with, 1
me., 1
A, 1
day, 1
or, 1
two, 1
of, 1
rest, 1
will, 1
set, 1
me, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
certain, 1
herbs, 1
most, 1
excellent, 1
for, 1
bruises.", 1
A, 1
peculiar, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
Dantes', 1
lips;, 1
he, 1
squeezed, 1
Jacopo's, 1
hand, 1
warmly,, 1
but, 1
nothing, 1
could, 1
shake, 1
his, 1
determination, 1
to, 1
remain--and, 1
remain, 1
alone., 1
The, 1
smugglers, 1
left, 1
with, 1
Edmond, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
requested, 1
and, 1
set, 1
sail,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
without, 1
turning, 1
about, 1
several, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
each, 1
time, 1
making, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cordial, 1
farewell,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
replied, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
only,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
move, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
his, 1
body., 1
Then,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,--"'Tis, 1
strange, 1
that, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
among, 1
such, 1
men, 1
that, 1
we, 1
find, 1
proofs, 1
of, 1
friendship, 1
and, 1
devotion.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
himself, 1
cautiously, 1
to, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
full, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
thence, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
tartan, 1
complete, 1
her, 1
preparations, 1
for, 1
sailing,, 1
weigh, 1
anchor,, 1
and,, 1
balancing, 1
herself, 1
as, 1
gracefully, 1
as, 1
a, 1
water-fowl, 1
ere, 1
it, 1
takes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wing,, 1
set, 1
sail., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
she, 1
was, 1
completely, 1
out, 1
of, 1
sight;, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
the, 1
wounded, 1
man, 1
to, 1
see, 1
her, 1
any, 1
longer, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was., 1
Then, 1
Dantes, 1
rose, 1
more, 1
agile, 1
and, 1
light, 1
than, 1
the, 1
kid, 1
among, 1
the, 1
myrtles, 1
and, 1
shrubs, 1
of, 1
these, 1
wild, 1
rocks,, 1
took, 1
his, 1
gun, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
his, 1
pickaxe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
marks, 1
he, 1
had, 1
noted, 1
terminated., 1
"And, 1
now,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
remembering, 1
the, 1
tale, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Arabian, 1
fisherman,, 1
which, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
related, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
"now,, 1
open, 1
sesame!", 1
Chapter, 1
24., 1
The, 1
Secret, 1
Cave., 1
The, 1
sun, 1
had, 1
nearly, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
meridian,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
scorching, 1
rays, 1
fell, 1
full, 1
on, 1
the, 1
rocks,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
themselves, 1
sensible, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heat., 1
Thousands, 1
of, 1
grasshoppers,, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bushes,, 1
chirped, 1
with, 1
a, 1
monotonous, 1
and, 1
dull, 1
note;, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
the, 1
myrtle, 1
and, 1
olive, 1
trees, 1
waved, 1
and, 1
rustled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wind., 1
At, 1
every, 1
step, 1
that, 1
Edmond, 1
took, 1
he, 1
disturbed, 1
the, 1
lizards, 1
glittering, 1
with, 1
the, 1
hues, 1
of, 1
the, 1
emerald;, 1
afar, 1
off, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
goats, 1
bounding, 1
from, 1
crag, 1
to, 1
crag., 1
In, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
the, 1
island, 1
was, 1
inhabited,, 1
yet, 1
Edmond, 1
felt, 1
himself, 1
alone,, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
God., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
an, 1
indescribable, 1
sensation, 1
somewhat, 1
akin, 1
to, 1
dread--that, 1
dread, 1
of, 1
the, 1
daylight, 1
which, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1
desert, 1
makes, 1
us, 1
fear, 1
we, 1
are, 1
watched, 1
and, 1
observed., 1
This, 1
feeling, 1
was, 1
so, 1
strong, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
his, 1
labor,, 1
he, 1
stopped,, 1
laid, 1
down, 1
his, 1
pickaxe,, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
gun,, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
rock,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
thence, 1
gazed, 1
round, 1
in, 1
every, 1
direction., 1
But, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
upon, 1
Corsica,, 1
the, 1
very, 1
houses, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
distinguish;, 1
or, 1
on, 1
Sardinia;, 1
or, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba,, 1
with, 1
its, 1
historical, 1
associations;, 1
or, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
imperceptible, 1
line, 1
that, 1
to, 1
the, 1
experienced, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
alone, 1
revealed, 1
the, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
Genoa, 1
the, 1
proud,, 1
and, 1
Leghorn, 1
the, 1
commercial,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
gazed., 1
It, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
brigantine, 1
that, 1
had, 1
left, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tartan, 1
that, 1
had, 1
just, 1
set, 1
sail,, 1
that, 1
Edmond, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
The, 1
first, 1
was, 1
just, 1
disappearing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
straits, 1
of, 1
Bonifacio;, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
following, 1
an, 1
opposite, 1
direction,, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
round, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Corsica., 1
This, 1
sight, 1
reassured, 1
him., 1
He, 1
then, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
objects, 1
near, 1
him., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
point, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island,--a, 1
statue, 1
on, 1
this, 1
vast, 1
pedestal, 1
of, 1
granite,, 1
nothing, 1
human, 1
appearing, 1
in, 1
sight,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
ocean, 1
beat, 1
against, 1
the, 1
base, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fringe, 1
of, 1
foam., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
with, 1
cautious, 1
and, 1
slow, 1
step,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
dreaded, 1
lest, 1
an, 1
accident, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
adroitly, 1
feigned, 1
should, 1
happen, 1
in, 1
reality., 1
Dantes,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
had, 1
traced, 1
the, 1
marks, 1
along, 1
the, 1
rocks,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
they, 1
led, 1
to, 1
a, 1
small, 1
creek,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
hidden, 1
like, 1
the, 1
bath, 1
of, 1
some, 1
ancient, 1
nymph., 1
This, 1
creek, 1
was, 1
sufficiently, 1
wide, 1
at, 1
its, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
deep, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre,, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
vessel, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lugger, 1
class,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
perfectly, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
observation., 1
Then, 1
following, 1
the, 1
clew, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
skilfully, 1
used, 1
to, 1
guide, 1
him, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Daedalian, 1
labyrinth, 1
of, 1
probabilities,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada,, 1
anxious, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
watched,, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
creek,, 1
concealed, 1
his, 1
little, 1
barque,, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
line, 1
marked, 1
by, 1
the, 1
notches, 1
in, 1
the, 1
rock,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
it, 1
had, 1
buried, 1
his, 1
treasure., 1
It, 1
was, 1
this, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
Dantes, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
circular, 1
rock., 1
One, 1
thing, 1
only, 1
perplexed, 1
Edmond,, 1
and, 1
destroyed, 1
his, 1
theory., 1
How, 1
could, 1
this, 1
rock,, 1
which, 1
weighed, 1
several, 1
tons,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
lifted, 1
to, 1
this, 1
spot,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
many, 1
men?, 1
Suddenly, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
flashed, 1
across, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
raising, 1
it,, 1
thought, 1
he,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
lowered, 1
it., 1
And, 1
he, 1
sprang, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
inspect, 1
the, 1
base, 1
on, 1
which, 1
it, 1
had, 1
formerly, 1
stood., 1
He, 1
soon, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
a, 1
slope, 1
had, 1
been, 1
formed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
had, 1
slid, 1
along, 1
this, 1
until, 1
it, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
it, 1
now, 1
occupied., 1
A, 1
large, 1
stone, 1
had, 1
served, 1
as, 1
a, 1
wedge;, 1
flints, 1
and, 1
pebbles, 1
had, 1
been, 1
inserted, 1
around, 1
it,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
orifice;, 1
this, 1
species, 1
of, 1
masonry, 1
had, 1
been, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
grass, 1
and, 1
weeds, 1
had, 1
grown, 1
there,, 1
moss, 1
had, 1
clung, 1
to, 1
the, 1
stones,, 1
myrtle-bushes, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
root,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
rock, 1
seemed, 1
fixed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
earth., 1
Dantes, 1
dug, 1
away, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
carefully,, 1
and, 1
detected,, 1
or, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
detected,, 1
the, 1
ingenious, 1
artifice., 1
He, 1
attacked, 1
this, 1
wall,, 1
cemented, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
pickaxe., 1
After, 1
ten, 1
minutes', 1
labor, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
gave, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hole, 1
large, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
insert, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
was, 1
opened., 1
Dantes, 1
went, 1
and, 1
cut, 1
the, 1
strongest, 1
olive-tree, 1
he, 1
could, 1
find,, 1
stripped, 1
off, 1
its, 1
branches,, 1
inserted, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hole,, 1
and, 1
used, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
lever., 1
But, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
was, 1
too, 1
heavy,, 1
and, 1
too, 1
firmly, 1
wedged,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
moved, 1
by, 1
any, 1
one, 1
man,, 1
were, 1
he, 1
Hercules, 1
himself., 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
must, 1
attack, 1
the, 1
wedge., 1
But, 1
how?, 1
He, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
around,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
horn, 1
full, 1
of, 1
powder, 1
which, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
Jacopo, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him., 1
He, 1
smiled;, 1
the, 1
infernal, 1
invention, 1
would, 1
serve, 1
him, 1
for, 1
this, 1
purpose., 1
With, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pickaxe,, 1
Dantes,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
labor-saving, 1
pioneer,, 1
dug, 1
a, 1
mine, 1
between, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
rock, 1
and, 1
the, 1
one, 1
that, 1
supported, 1
it,, 1
filled, 1
it, 1
with, 1
powder,, 1
then, 1
made, 1
a, 1
match, 1
by, 1
rolling, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
in, 1
saltpetre., 1
He, 1
lighted, 1
it, 1
and, 1
retired., 1
The, 1
explosion, 1
soon, 1
followed;, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
rock, 1
was, 1
lifted, 1
from, 1
its, 1
base, 1
by, 1
the, 1
terrific, 1
force, 1
of, 1
the, 1
powder;, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
one, 1
flew, 1
into, 1
pieces;, 1
thousands, 1
of, 1
insects, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
aperture, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
previously, 1
formed,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
huge, 1
snake,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
guardian, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
the, 1
treasure,, 1
rolled, 1
himself, 1
along, 1
in, 1
darkening, 1
coils,, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
Dantes, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
rock,, 1
which, 1
now,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
support,, 1
leaned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
The, 1
intrepid, 1
treasure-seeker, 1
walked, 1
round, 1
it,, 1
and,, 1
selecting, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
most, 1
susceptible, 1
to, 1
attack,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
lever, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crevices,, 1
and, 1
strained, 1
every, 1
nerve, 1
to, 1
move, 1
the, 1
mass., 1
The, 1
rock,, 1
already, 1
shaken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
explosion,, 1
tottered, 1
on, 1
its, 1
base., 1
Dantes, 1
redoubled, 1
his, 1
efforts;, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ancient, 1
Titans,, 1
who, 1
uprooted, 1
the, 1
mountains, 1
to, 1
hurl, 1
against, 1
the, 1
father, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gods., 1
The, 1
rock, 1
yielded,, 1
rolled, 1
over,, 1
bounded, 1
from, 1
point, 1
to, 1
point,, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ocean., 1
On, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
it, 1
had, 1
occupied, 1
was, 1
a, 1
circular, 1
space,, 1
exposing, 1
an, 1
iron, 1
ring, 1
let, 1
into, 1
a, 1
square, 1
flag-stone., 1
Dantes, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
surprise;, 1
never, 1
had, 1
a, 1
first, 1
attempt, 1
been, 1
crowned, 1
with, 1
more, 1
perfect, 1
success., 1
He, 1
would, 1
fain, 1
have, 1
continued,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
trembled,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
so, 1
violently,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
sight, 1
became, 1
so, 1
dim,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
pause., 1
This, 1
feeling, 1
lasted, 1
but, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
Edmond, 1
inserted, 1
his, 1
lever, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ring, 1
and, 1
exerted, 1
all, 1
his, 1
strength;, 1
the, 1
flag-stone, 1
yielded,, 1
and, 1
disclosed, 1
steps, 1
that, 1
descended, 1
until, 1
they, 1
were, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
obscurity, 1
of, 1
a, 1
subterraneous, 1
grotto., 1
Any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
would, 1
have, 1
rushed, 1
on, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy., 1
Dantes, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
hesitated,, 1
and, 1
reflected., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
"be, 1
a, 1
man., 1
I, 1
am, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
adversity., 1
I, 1
must, 1
not, 1
be, 1
cast, 1
down, 1
by, 1
the, 1
discovery, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deceived., 1
What,, 1
then,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
all, 1
I, 1
have, 1
suffered?, 1
The, 1
heart, 1
breaks, 1
when,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
been, 1
elated, 1
by, 1
flattering, 1
hopes,, 1
it, 1
sees, 1
all, 1
its, 1
illusions, 1
destroyed., 1
Faria, 1
has, 1
dreamed, 1
this;, 1
the, 1
Cardinal, 1
Spada, 1
buried, 1
no, 1
treasure, 1
here;, 1
perhaps, 1
he, 1
never, 1
came, 1
here,, 1
or, 1
if, 1
he, 1
did,, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia,, 1
the, 1
intrepid, 1
adventurer,, 1
the, 1
stealthy, 1
and, 1
indefatigable, 1
plunderer,, 1
has, 1
followed, 1
him,, 1
discovered, 1
his, 1
traces,, 1
pursued, 1
them, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done,, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
and, 1
descending, 1
before, 1
me,, 1
has, 1
left, 1
me, 1
nothing.", 1
He, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
pensive,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
aperture, 1
that, 1
was, 1
open, 1
at, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
"Now, 1
that, 1
I, 1
expect, 1
nothing,, 1
now, 1
that, 1
I, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
entertain, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
hopes,, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
this, 1
adventure, 1
becomes, 1
simply, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
curiosity.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
again, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
thoughtful., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes;, 1
this, 1
is, 1
an, 1
adventure, 1
worthy, 1
a, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
varied, 1
career, 1
of, 1
that, 1
royal, 1
bandit., 1
This, 1
fabulous, 1
event, 1
formed, 1
but, 1
a, 1
link, 1
in, 1
a, 1
long, 1
chain, 1
of, 1
marvels., 1
Yes,, 1
Borgia, 1
has, 1
been, 1
here,, 1
a, 1
torch, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
a, 1
sword, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
within, 1
twenty, 1
paces,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
this, 1
rock,, 1
perhaps, 1
two, 1
guards, 1
kept, 1
watch, 1
on, 1
land, 1
and, 1
sea,, 1
while, 1
their, 1
master, 1
descended,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
descend,, 1
dispelling, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
before, 1
his, 1
awe-inspiring, 1
progress.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
was, 1
the, 1
fate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guards, 1
who, 1
thus, 1
possessed, 1
his, 1
secret?", 1
asked, 1
Dantes, 1
of, 1
himself., 1
"The, 1
fate,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
smiling,, 1
"of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
buried, 1
Alaric.", 1
"Yet,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
come,", 1
thought, 1
Dantes,, 1
"he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
found, 1
the, 1
treasure,, 1
and, 1
Borgia,, 1
he, 1
who, 1
compared, 1
Italy, 1
to, 1
an, 1
artichoke,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
devour, 1
leaf, 1
by, 1
leaf,, 1
knew, 1
too, 1
well, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
time, 1
to, 1
waste, 1
it, 1
in, 1
replacing, 1
this, 1
rock., 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
down.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
descended,, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
murmuring, 1
that, 1
last, 1
word, 1
of, 1
human, 1
philosophy,, 1
"Perhaps!", 1
But, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
mephitic, 1
atmosphere, 1
he, 1
had, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
find,, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
dim, 1
and, 1
bluish, 1
light,, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
entered,, 1
not, 1
merely, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aperture, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
formed,, 1
but, 1
by, 1
the, 1
interstices, 1
and, 1
crevices, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
which, 1
were, 1
visible, 1
from, 1
without,, 1
and, 1
through, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
distinguish, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
sky, 1
and, 1
the, 1
waving, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evergreen, 1
oaks,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tendrils, 1
of, 1
the, 1
creepers, 1
that, 1
grew, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rocks., 1
After, 1
having, 1
stood, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cavern,, 1
the, 1
atmosphere, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
warm, 1
than, 1
damp,, 1
Dantes', 1
eye,, 1
habituated, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
darkness,, 1
could, 1
pierce, 1
even, 1
to, 1
the, 1
remotest, 1
angles, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cavern,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
of, 1
granite, 1
that, 1
sparkled, 1
like, 1
diamonds., 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Edmond,, 1
smiling,, 1
"these, 1
are, 1
the, 1
treasures, 1
the, 1
cardinal, 1
has, 1
left;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
good, 1
abbe,, 1
seeing, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
these, 1
glittering, 1
walls,, 1
has, 1
indulged, 1
in, 1
fallacious, 1
hopes.", 1
But, 1
he, 1
called, 1
to, 1
mind, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
will,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
by, 1
heart., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
farthest, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
opening,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
cardinal's, 1
will., 1
He, 1
had, 1
only, 1
found, 1
the, 1
first, 1
grotto;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
now, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
the, 1
second., 1
Dantes, 1
continued, 1
his, 1
search., 1
He, 1
reflected, 1
that, 1
this, 1
second, 1
grotto, 1
must, 1
penetrate, 1
deeper, 1
into, 1
the, 1
island;, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
stones,, 1
and, 1
sounded, 1
one, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
where, 1
he, 1
fancied, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
existed,, 1
masked, 1
for, 1
precaution's, 1
sake., 1
The, 1
pickaxe, 1
struck, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dull, 1
sound, 1
that, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Dantes', 1
forehead, 1
large, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
perspiration., 1
At, 1
last, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
one, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
gave, 1
forth, 1
a, 1
more, 1
hollow, 1
and, 1
deeper, 1
echo;, 1
he, 1
eagerly, 1
advanced,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
quickness, 1
of, 1
perception, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
but, 1
a, 1
prisoner, 1
possesses,, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
there,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
must, 1
be., 1
However,, 1
he,, 1
like, 1
Caesar, 1
Borgia,, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
time;, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
fruitless, 1
toil,, 1
he, 1
sounded, 1
all, 1
the, 1
other, 1
walls, 1
with, 1
his, 1
pickaxe,, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
with, 1
the, 1
butt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
gun,, 1
and, 1
finding, 1
nothing, 1
that, 1
appeared, 1
suspicious,, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
whence, 1
issued, 1
the, 1
consoling, 1
sound, 1
he, 1
had, 1
before, 1
heard., 1
He, 1
again, 1
struck, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
greater, 1
force., 1
Then, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
thing, 1
occurred., 1
As, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
stucco, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
used, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
work, 1
of, 1
arabesques, 1
broke, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
in, 1
flakes,, 1
exposing, 1
a, 1
large, 1
white, 1
stone., 1
The, 1
aperture, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock, 1
had, 1
been, 1
closed, 1
with, 1
stones,, 1
then, 1
this, 1
stucco, 1
had, 1
been, 1
applied,, 1
and, 1
painted, 1
to, 1
imitate, 1
granite., 1
Dantes, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
end, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pickaxe,, 1
which, 1
entered, 1
someway, 1
between, 1
the, 1
interstices., 1
It, 1
was, 1
there, 1
he, 1
must, 1
dig., 1
But, 1
by, 1
some, 1
strange, 1
play, 1
of, 1
emotion,, 1
in, 1
proportion, 1
as, 1
the, 1
proofs, 1
that, 1
Faria,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
deceived, 1
became, 1
stronger,, 1
so, 1
did, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
give, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
discouragement, 1
stole, 1
over, 1
him., 1
This, 1
last, 1
proof,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
giving, 1
him, 1
fresh, 1
strength,, 1
deprived, 1
him, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
the, 1
pickaxe, 1
descended,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
fell;, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
remounted, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
alleging, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
as, 1
an, 1
excuse,, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
be, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
was, 1
watching, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
because, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
faint., 1
The, 1
island, 1
was, 1
deserted,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
cover, 1
it, 1
with, 1
its, 1
fiery, 1
glance;, 1
afar, 1
off,, 1
a, 1
few, 1
small, 1
fishing, 1
boats, 1
studded, 1
the, 1
bosom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
ocean., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
tasted, 1
nothing,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
not, 1
of, 1
hunger, 1
at, 1
such, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
he, 1
hastily, 1
swallowed, 1
a, 1
few, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
rum,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
cavern., 1
The, 1
pickaxe, 1
that, 1
had, 1
seemed, 1
so, 1
heavy,, 1
was, 1
now, 1
like, 1
a, 1
feather, 1
in, 1
his, 1
grasp;, 1
he, 1
seized, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
attacked, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
After, 1
several, 1
blows, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
the, 1
stones, 1
were, 1
not, 1
cemented,, 1
but, 1
had, 1
been, 1
merely, 1
placed, 1
one, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
stucco;, 1
he, 1
inserted, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pickaxe,, 1
and, 1
using, 1
the, 1
handle, 1
as, 1
a, 1
lever,, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
soon, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
turn, 1
as, 1
if, 1
on, 1
hinges,, 1
and, 1
fall, 1
at, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
He, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
now,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
tooth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pickaxe, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
the, 1
stones, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
one, 1
by, 1
one., 1
The, 1
aperture, 1
was, 1
already, 1
sufficiently, 1
large, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
enter,, 1
but, 1
by, 1
waiting,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
still, 1
cling, 1
to, 1
hope,, 1
and, 1
retard, 1
the, 1
certainty, 1
of, 1
deception., 1
At, 1
last,, 1
after, 1
renewed, 1
hesitation,, 1
Dantes, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
second, 1
grotto., 1
The, 1
second, 1
grotto, 1
was, 1
lower, 1
and, 1
more, 1
gloomy, 1
than, 1
the, 1
first;, 1
the, 1
air, 1
that, 1
could, 1
only, 1
enter, 1
by, 1
the, 1
newly, 1
formed, 1
opening, 1
had, 1
the, 1
mephitic, 1
smell, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
surprised, 1
not, 1
to, 1
find, 1
in, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
cavern., 1
He, 1
waited, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
pure, 1
air, 1
to, 1
displace, 1
the, 1
foul, 1
atmosphere,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
on., 1
At, 1
the, 1
left, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
was, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
deep, 1
angle., 1
But, 1
to, 1
Dantes', 1
eye, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
darkness., 1
He, 1
glanced, 1
around, 1
this, 1
second, 1
grotto;, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
empty., 1
The, 1
treasure,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
existed,, 1
was, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
this, 1
corner., 1
The, 1
time, 1
had, 1
at, 1
length, 1
arrived;, 1
two, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
earth, 1
removed,, 1
and, 1
Dantes', 1
fate, 1
would, 1
be, 1
decided., 1
He, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
angle,, 1
and, 1
summoning, 1
all, 1
his, 1
resolution,, 1
attacked, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pickaxe., 1
At, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
or, 1
sixth, 1
blow, 1
the, 1
pickaxe, 1
struck, 1
against, 1
an, 1
iron, 1
substance., 1
Never, 1
did, 1
funeral, 1
knell,, 1
never, 1
did, 1
alarm-bell,, 1
produce, 1
a, 1
greater, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
the, 1
hearer., 1
Had, 1
Dantes, 1
found, 1
nothing, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
become, 1
more, 1
ghastly, 1
pale., 1
He, 1
again, 1
struck, 1
his, 1
pickaxe, 1
into, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
encountered, 1
the, 1
same, 1
resistance,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
the, 1
same, 1
sound., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
casket, 1
of, 1
wood, 1
bound, 1
with, 1
iron,", 1
thought, 1
he., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
passed, 1
rapidly, 1
before, 1
the, 1
opening;, 1
Dantes, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
gun,, 1
sprang, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
and, 1
mounted, 1
the, 1
stair., 1
A, 1
wild, 1
goat, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
before, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cave,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
feeding, 1
at, 1
a, 1
little, 1
distance., 1
This, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
favorable, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
his, 1
dinner;, 1
but, 1
Dantes, 1
feared, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
report, 1
of, 1
his, 1
gun, 1
should, 1
attract, 1
attention., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
cut, 1
a, 1
branch, 1
of, 1
a, 1
resinous, 1
tree,, 1
lighted, 1
it, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
at, 1
which, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
had, 1
prepared, 1
their, 1
breakfast,, 1
and, 1
descended, 1
with, 1
this, 1
torch., 1
He, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
see, 1
everything., 1
He, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
hole, 1
he, 1
had, 1
dug,, 1
and, 1
now,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
torch,, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
his, 1
pickaxe, 1
had, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
struck, 1
against, 1
iron, 1
and, 1
wood., 1
He, 1
planted, 1
his, 1
torch, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
and, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
labor., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
a, 1
space, 1
three, 1
feet, 1
long, 1
by, 1
two, 1
feet, 1
broad, 1
was, 1
cleared,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
see, 1
an, 1
oaken, 1
coffer,, 1
bound, 1
with, 1
cut, 1
steel;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lid, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
engraved, 1
on, 1
a, 1
silver, 1
plate,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
still, 1
untarnished,, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Spada, 1
family--viz.,, 1
a, 1
sword,, 1
pale,, 1
on, 1
an, 1
oval, 1
shield,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
armorial, 1
bearings,, 1
and, 1
surmounted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
cardinal's, 1
hat;, 1
Dantes, 1
easily, 1
recognized, 1
them,, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
drawn, 1
them, 1
for, 1
him., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
doubt:, 1
the, 1
treasure, 1
was, 1
there--no, 1
one, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
at, 1
such, 1
pains, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
an, 1
empty, 1
casket., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
he, 1
had, 1
cleared, 1
every, 1
obstacle, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
successively, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
placed, 1
between, 1
two, 1
padlocks,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
handles, 1
at, 1
each, 1
end,, 1
all, 1
carved, 1
as, 1
things, 1
were, 1
carved, 1
at, 1
that, 1
epoch,, 1
when, 1
art, 1
rendered, 1
the, 1
commonest, 1
metals, 1
precious., 1
Dantes, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
handles,, 1
and, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
lift, 1
the, 1
coffer;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible., 1
He, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
open, 1
it;, 1
lock, 1
and, 1
padlock, 1
were, 1
fastened;, 1
these, 1
faithful, 1
guardians, 1
seemed, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
surrender, 1
their, 1
trust., 1
Dantes, 1
inserted, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pickaxe, 1
between, 1
the, 1
coffer, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lid,, 1
and, 1
pressing, 1
with, 1
all, 1
his, 1
force, 1
on, 1
the, 1
handle,, 1
burst, 1
open, 1
the, 1
fastenings., 1
The, 1
hinges, 1
yielded, 1
in, 1
their, 1
turn, 1
and, 1
fell,, 1
still, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
their, 1
grasp, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wood,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
chest, 1
was, 1
open., 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
vertigo;, 1
he, 1
cocked, 1
his, 1
gun, 1
and, 1
laid, 1
it, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
He, 1
then, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
as, 1
children, 1
do, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
they, 1
may, 1
see, 1
in, 1
the, 1
resplendent, 1
night, 1
of, 1
their, 1
own, 1
imagination, 1
more, 1
stars, 1
than, 1
are, 1
visible, 1
in, 1
the, 1
firmament;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
re-opened, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
motionless, 1
with, 1
amazement., 1
Three, 1
compartments, 1
divided, 1
the, 1
coffer., 1
In, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
blazed, 1
piles, 1
of, 1
golden, 1
coin;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
second,, 1
were, 1
ranged, 1
bars, 1
of, 1
unpolished, 1
gold,, 1
which, 1
possessed, 1
nothing, 1
attractive, 1
save, 1
their, 1
value;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
third,, 1
Edmond, 1
grasped, 1
handfuls, 1
of, 1
diamonds,, 1
pearls,, 1
and, 1
rubies,, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
sounded, 1
like, 1
hail, 1
against, 1
glass., 1
After, 1
having, 1
touched,, 1
felt,, 1
examined, 1
these, 1
treasures,, 1
Edmond, 1
rushed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
caverns, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
frenzy;, 1
he, 1
leaped, 1
on, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
could, 1
behold, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
He, 1
was, 1
alone--alone, 1
with, 1
these, 1
countless,, 1
these, 1
unheard-of, 1
treasures!, 1
was, 1
he, 1
awake,, 1
or, 1
was, 1
it, 1
but, 1
a, 1
dream?, 1
He, 1
would, 1
fain, 1
have, 1
gazed, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
gold,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
strength, 1
enough;, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
he, 1
leaned, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
from, 1
leaving, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
rushed, 1
madly, 1
about, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
terrifying, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
goats, 1
and, 1
scaring, 1
the, 1
sea-fowls, 1
with, 1
his, 1
wild, 1
cries, 1
and, 1
gestures;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
returned,, 1
and,, 1
still, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
the, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
before, 1
this, 1
mine, 1
of, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
jewels., 1
This, 1
time, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
and,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
convulsively,, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
prayer, 1
intelligible, 1
to, 1
God, 1
alone., 1
He, 1
soon, 1
became, 1
calmer, 1
and, 1
more, 1
happy,, 1
for, 1
only, 1
now, 1
did, 1
he, 1
begin, 1
to, 1
realize, 1
his, 1
felicity., 1
He, 1
then, 1
set, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
work, 1
to, 1
count, 1
his, 1
fortune., 1
There, 1
were, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
ingots, 1
of, 1
gold,, 1
each, 1
weighing, 1
from, 1
two, 1
to, 1
three, 1
pounds;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
piled, 1
up, 1
twenty-five, 1
thousand, 1
crowns,, 1
each, 1
worth, 1
about, 1
eighty, 1
francs, 1
of, 1
our, 1
money,, 1
and, 1
bearing, 1
the, 1
effigies, 1
of, 1
Alexander, 1
VI., 1
and, 1
his, 1
predecessors;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
the, 1
complement, 1
was, 1
not, 1
half, 1
empty., 1
And, 1
he, 1
measured, 1
ten, 1
double, 1
handfuls, 1
of, 1
pearls,, 1
diamonds,, 1
and, 1
other, 1
gems,, 1
many, 1
of, 1
which,, 1
mounted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
most, 1
famous, 1
workmen,, 1
were, 1
valuable, 1
beyond, 1
their, 1
intrinsic, 1
worth., 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
light, 1
gradually, 1
disappear,, 1
and, 1
fearing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
surprised, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cavern,, 1
left, 1
it,, 1
his, 1
gun, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
A, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
biscuit, 1
and, 1
a, 1
small, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
rum, 1
formed, 1
his, 1
supper,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
snatched, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hours', 1
sleep,, 1
lying, 1
over, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cave., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
night, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
terror,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
this, 1
man, 1
of, 1
stupendous, 1
emotions, 1
had, 1
already, 1
experienced, 1
twice, 1
or, 1
thrice, 1
in, 1
his, 1
lifetime., 1
Chapter, 1
25., 1
The, 1
Unknown., 1
Day,, 1
for, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
so, 1
eagerly, 1
and, 1
impatiently, 1
waited, 1
with, 1
open, 1
eyes,, 1
again, 1
dawned., 1
With, 1
the, 1
first, 1
light, 1
Dantes, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
search., 1
Again, 1
he, 1
climbed, 1
the, 1
rocky, 1
height, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
strained, 1
his, 1
view, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
every, 1
peculiarity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
landscape;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
wore, 1
the, 1
same, 1
wild,, 1
barren, 1
aspect, 1
when, 1
seen, 1
by, 1
the, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
sun, 1
which, 1
it, 1
had, 1
done, 1
when, 1
surveyed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fading, 1
glimmer, 1
of, 1
eve., 1
Descending, 1
into, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
he, 1
lifted, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
filled, 1
his, 1
pockets, 1
with, 1
gems,, 1
put, 1
the, 1
box, 1
together, 1
as, 1
well, 1
and, 1
securely, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could,, 1
sprinkled, 1
fresh, 1
sand, 1
over, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
from, 1
which, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taken,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
carefully, 1
trod, 1
down, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
to, 1
give, 1
it, 1
everywhere, 1
a, 1
uniform, 1
appearance;, 1
then,, 1
quitting, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
he, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
heaping, 1
on, 1
it, 1
broken, 1
masses, 1
of, 1
rocks, 1
and, 1
rough, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
crumbling, 1
granite,, 1
filling, 1
the, 1
interstices, 1
with, 1
earth,, 1
into, 1
which, 1
he, 1
deftly, 1
inserted, 1
rapidly, 1
growing, 1
plants,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
myrtle, 1
and, 1
flowering, 1
thorn,, 1
then, 1
carefully, 1
watering, 1
these, 1
new, 1
plantations,, 1
he, 1
scrupulously, 1
effaced, 1
every, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
footsteps,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cavern, 1
as, 1
savage-looking, 1
and, 1
untrodden, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
it., 1
This, 1
done,, 1
he, 1
impatiently, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companions., 1
To, 1
wait, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
watching, 1
like, 1
a, 1
dragon, 1
over, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
incalculable, 1
riches, 1
that, 1
had, 1
thus, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
his, 1
possession, 1
satisfied, 1
not, 1
the, 1
cravings, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
which, 1
yearned, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
dwell, 1
among, 1
mankind,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
rank,, 1
power,, 1
and, 1
influence, 1
which, 1
are, 1
always, 1
accorded, 1
to, 1
wealth--that, 1
first, 1
and, 1
greatest, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
forces, 1
within, 1
the, 1
grasp, 1
of, 1
man., 1
On, 1
the, 1
sixth, 1
day,, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
returned., 1
From, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
Dantes, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
rig, 1
and, 1
handling, 1
of, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia,, 1
and, 1
dragging, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
affected, 1
difficulty, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
landing-place,, 1
he, 1
met, 1
his, 1
companions, 1
with, 1
an, 1
assurance, 1
that,, 1
although, 1
considerably, 1
better, 1
than, 1
when, 1
they, 1
quitted, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
still, 1
suffered, 1
acutely, 1
from, 1
his, 1
late, 1
accident., 1
He, 1
then, 1
inquired, 1
how, 1
they, 1
had, 1
fared, 1
in, 1
their, 1
trip., 1
To, 1
this, 1
question, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
replied, 1
that,, 1
although, 1
successful, 1
in, 1
landing, 1
their, 1
cargo, 1
in, 1
safety,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
done, 1
so, 1
when, 1
they, 1
received, 1
intelligence, 1
that, 1
a, 1
guard-ship, 1
had, 1
just, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
port, 1
of, 1
Toulon, 1
and, 1
was, 1
crowding, 1
all, 1
sail, 1
towards, 1
them., 1
This, 1
obliged, 1
them, 1
to, 1
make, 1
all, 1
the, 1
speed, 1
they, 1
could, 1
to, 1
evade, 1
the, 1
enemy,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
could, 1
but, 1
lament, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
whose, 1
superior, 1
skill, 1
in, 1
the, 1
management, 1
of, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
would, 1
have, 1
availed, 1
them, 1
so, 1
materially., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
pursuing, 1
vessel, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
overtaken, 1
them, 1
when,, 1
fortunately,, 1
night, 1
came, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
enabled, 1
them, 1
to, 1
double, 1
the, 1
Cape, 1
of, 1
Corsica,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
elude, 1
all, 1
further, 1
pursuit., 1
Upon, 1
the, 1
whole,, 1
however,, 1
the, 1
trip, 1
had, 1
been, 1
sufficiently, 1
successful, 1
to, 1
satisfy, 1
all, 1
concerned;, 1
while, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
and, 1
particularly, 1
Jacopo,, 1
expressed, 1
great, 1
regrets, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
an, 1
equal, 1
sharer, 1
with, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
the, 1
profits,, 1
which, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
no, 1
less, 1
a, 1
sum, 1
than, 1
fifty, 1
piastres, 1
each., 1
Edmond, 1
preserved, 1
the, 1
most, 1
admirable, 1
self-command,, 1
not, 1
suffering, 1
the, 1
faintest, 1
indication, 1
of, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
enumeration, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
benefits, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
reaped, 1
had, 1
he, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
island;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
had, 1
merely, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
him, 1
away,, 1
he, 1
embarked, 1
that, 1
same, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
proceeded, 1
with, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
to, 1
Leghorn., 1
Arrived, 1
at, 1
Leghorn,, 1
he, 1
repaired, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Jew,, 1
a, 1
dealer, 1
in, 1
precious, 1
stones,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
disposed, 1
of, 1
four, 1
of, 1
his, 1
smallest, 1
diamonds, 1
for, 1
five, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
each., 1
Dantes, 1
half, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
such, 1
valuable, 1
jewels, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
sailor, 1
like, 1
himself, 1
might, 1
excite, 1
suspicion;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
cunning, 1
purchaser, 1
asked, 1
no, 1
troublesome, 1
questions, 1
concerning, 1
a, 1
bargain, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
gained, 1
a, 1
round, 1
profit, 1
of, 1
at, 1
least, 1
eighty, 1
per, 1
cent., 1
The, 1
following, 1
day, 1
Dantes, 1
presented, 1
Jacopo, 1
with, 1
an, 1
entirely, 1
new, 1
vessel,, 1
accompanying, 1
the, 1
gift, 1
by, 1
a, 1
donation, 1
of, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
piastres,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
provide, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
a, 1
suitable, 1
crew, 1
and, 1
other, 1
requisites, 1
for, 1
his, 1
outfit,, 1
upon, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
go, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
Marseilles, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
inquiring, 1
after, 1
an, 1
old, 1
man, 1
named, 1
Louis, 1
Dantes,, 1
residing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
a, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
called, 1
Mercedes,, 1
an, 1
inhabitant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
village., 1
Jacopo, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
believe, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
at, 1
receiving, 1
this, 1
magnificent, 1
present,, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
account, 1
for, 1
by, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
merely, 1
been, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
from, 1
whim, 1
and, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
spite, 1
his, 1
family,, 1
who, 1
did, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
him, 1
as, 1
much, 1
money, 1
as, 1
he, 1
liked, 1
to, 1
spend;, 1
but, 1
that, 1
on, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
at, 1
Leghorn, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
into, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
a, 1
large, 1
fortune,, 1
left, 1
him, 1
by, 1
an, 1
uncle,, 1
whose, 1
sole, 1
heir, 1
he, 1
was., 1
The, 1
superior, 1
education, 1
of, 1
Dantes, 1
gave, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
such, 1
extreme, 1
probability, 1
to, 1
this, 1
statement, 1
that, 1
it, 1
never, 1
once, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
Jacopo, 1
to, 1
doubt, 1
its, 1
accuracy., 1
The, 1
term, 1
for, 1
which, 1
Edmond, 1
had, 1
engaged, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
on, 1
board, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia, 1
having, 1
expired,, 1
Dantes, 1
took, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
who, 1
at, 1
first, 1
tried, 1
all, 1
his, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
persuasion, 1
to, 1
induce, 1
him, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
but, 1
having, 1
been, 1
told, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
legacy,, 1
he, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
importune, 1
him, 1
further., 1
The, 1
following, 1
morning, 1
Jacopo, 1
set, 1
sail, 1
for, 1
Marseilles,, 1
with, 1
directions, 1
from, 1
Dantes, 1
to, 1
join, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Having, 1
seen, 1
Jacopo, 1
fairly, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
harbor,, 1
Dantes, 1
proceeded, 1
to, 1
make, 1
his, 1
final, 1
adieus, 1
on, 1
board, 1
The, 1
Young, 1
Amelia,, 1
distributing, 1
so, 1
liberal, 1
a, 1
gratuity, 1
among, 1
her, 1
crew, 1
as, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
for, 1
him, 1
the, 1
good, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
expressions, 1
of, 1
cordial, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
all, 1
that, 1
concerned, 1
him., 1
To, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
he, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
write, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
as, 1
to, 1
his, 1
future, 1
plans., 1
Then, 1
Dantes, 1
departed, 1
for, 1
Genoa., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
a, 1
small, 1
yacht, 1
was, 1
under, 1
trial, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bay;, 1
this, 1
yacht, 1
had, 1
been, 1
built, 1
by, 1
order, 1
of, 1
an, 1
Englishman,, 1
who,, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Genoese, 1
excelled, 1
all, 1
other, 1
builders, 1
along, 1
the, 1
shores, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean, 1
in, 1
the, 1
construction, 1
of, 1
fast-sailing, 1
vessels,, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
possessing, 1
a, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1
their, 1
skill;, 1
the, 1
price, 1
agreed, 1
upon, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Genoese, 1
builder, 1
was, 1
forty, 1
thousand, 1
francs., 1
Dantes,, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
and, 1
capability, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
vessel,, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
its, 1
owner, 1
to, 1
transfer, 1
it, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
offering, 1
sixty, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1
upon, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
take, 1
immediate, 1
possession., 1
The, 1
proposal, 1
was, 1
too, 1
advantageous, 1
to, 1
be, 1
refused,, 1
the, 1
more, 1
so, 1
as, 1
the, 1
person, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
was, 1
intended, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
tour, 1
through, 1
Switzerland,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
not, 1
expected, 1
back, 1
in, 1
less, 1
than, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
or, 1
a, 1
month,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
time, 1
the, 1
builder, 1
reckoned, 1
upon, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
another., 1
A, 1
bargain, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
struck., 1
Dantes, 1
led, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dwelling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Jew;, 1
retired, 1
with, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
to, 1
a, 1
small, 1
back, 1
parlor,, 1
and, 1
upon, 1
their, 1
return, 1
the, 1
Jew, 1
counted, 1
out, 1
to, 1
the, 1
shipbuilder, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
sixty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
bright, 1
gold, 1
pieces., 1
The, 1
delighted, 1
builder, 1
then, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
services, 1
in, 1
providing, 1
a, 1
suitable, 1
crew, 1
for, 1
the, 1
little, 1
vessel,, 1
but, 1
this, 1
Dantes, 1
declined, 1
with, 1
many, 1
thanks,, 1
saying, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
cruise, 1
about, 1
quite, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
principal, 1
pleasure, 1
consisted, 1
in, 1
managing, 1
his, 1
yacht, 1
himself;, 1
the, 1
only, 1
thing, 1
the, 1
builder, 1
could, 1
oblige, 1
him, 1
in, 1
would, 1
be, 1
to, 1
contrive, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
secret, 1
closet, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cabin, 1
at, 1
his, 1
bed's, 1
head,, 1
the, 1
closet, 1
to, 1
contain, 1
three, 1
divisions,, 1
so, 1
constructed, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
all, 1
but, 1
himself., 1
The, 1
builder, 1
cheerfully, 1
undertook, 1
the, 1
commission,, 1
and, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
have, 1
these, 1
secret, 1
places, 1
completed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
Dantes, 1
furnishing, 1
the, 1
dimensions, 1
and, 1
plan, 1
in, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
which, 1
they, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
constructed., 1
The, 1
following, 1
day, 1
Dantes, 1
sailed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
yacht, 1
from, 1
Genoa,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
inspection, 1
of, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
crowd, 1
drawn, 1
together, 1
by, 1
curiosity, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
rich, 1
Spanish, 1
nobleman, 1
who, 1
preferred, 1
managing, 1
his, 1
own, 1
yacht., 1
But, 1
their, 1
wonder, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
changed, 1
to, 1
admiration, 1
at, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
perfect, 1
skill, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
handled, 1
the, 1
helm., 1
The, 1
boat,, 1
indeed,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
animated, 1
with, 1
almost, 1
human, 1
intelligence,, 1
so, 1
promptly, 1
did, 1
it, 1
obey, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
touch;, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
required, 1
but, 1
a, 1
short, 1
trial, 1
of, 1
his, 1
beautiful, 1
craft, 1
to, 1
acknowledge, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Genoese, 1
had, 1
not, 1
without, 1
reason, 1
attained, 1
their, 1
high, 1
reputation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
art, 1
of, 1
shipbuilding., 1
The, 1
spectators, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
little, 1
vessel, 1
with, 1
their, 1
eyes, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
it, 1
remained, 1
visible;, 1
they, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
their, 1
conjectures, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
probable, 1
destination., 1
Some, 1
insisted, 1
she, 1
was, 1
making, 1
for, 1
Corsica,, 1
others, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba;, 1
bets, 1
were, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
any, 1
amount, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
bound, 1
for, 1
Spain;, 1
while, 1
Africa, 1
was, 1
positively, 1
reported, 1
by, 1
many, 1
persons, 1
as, 1
her, 1
intended, 1
course;, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Yet, 1
thither, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
Dantes, 1
guided, 1
his, 1
vessel,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
close, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
day;, 1
his, 1
boat, 1
had, 1
proved, 1
herself, 1
a, 1
first-class, 1
sailer,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
come, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
Genoa, 1
in, 1
thirty-five, 1
hours., 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
carefully, 1
noted, 1
the, 1
general, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
and,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
landing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
place,, 1
he, 1
dropped, 1
anchor, 1
in, 1
the, 1
little, 1
creek., 1
The, 1
island, 1
was, 1
utterly, 1
deserted,, 1
and, 1
bore, 1
no, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
having, 1
been, 1
visited, 1
since, 1
he, 1
went, 1
away;, 1
his, 1
treasure, 1
was, 1
just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
it., 1
Early, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
commenced, 1
the, 1
removal, 1
of, 1
his, 1
riches,, 1
and, 1
ere, 1
nightfall, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
his, 1
immense, 1
wealth, 1
was, 1
safely, 1
deposited, 1
in, 1
the, 1
compartments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
locker., 1
A, 1
week, 1
passed, 1
by., 1
Dantes, 1
employed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
manoeuvring, 1
his, 1
yacht, 1
round, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
studying, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
skilful, 1
horseman, 1
would, 1
the, 1
animal, 1
he, 1
destined, 1
for, 1
some, 1
important, 1
service,, 1
till, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
that, 1
time, 1
he, 1
was, 1
perfectly, 1
conversant, 1
with, 1
its, 1
good, 1
and, 1
bad, 1
qualities., 1
The, 1
former, 1
Dantes, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
augment,, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
to, 1
remedy., 1
Upon, 1
the, 1
eighth, 1
day, 1
he, 1
discerned, 1
a, 1
small, 1
vessel, 1
under, 1
full, 1
sail, 1
approaching, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
As, 1
it, 1
drew, 1
near,, 1
he, 1
recognized, 1
it, 1
as, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
he, 1
had, 1
given, 1
to, 1
Jacopo., 1
He, 1
immediately, 1
signalled, 1
it., 1
His, 1
signal, 1
was, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
new-comer, 1
lay, 1
at, 1
anchor, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
yacht., 1
A, 1
mournful, 1
answer, 1
awaited, 1
each, 1
of, 1
Edmond's, 1
eager, 1
inquiries, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
information, 1
Jacopo, 1
had, 1
obtained., 1
Old, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
Dantes, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
these, 1
melancholy, 1
tidings, 1
with, 1
outward, 1
calmness;, 1
but,, 1
leaping, 1
lightly, 1
ashore,, 1
he, 1
signified, 1
his, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
alone., 1
In, 1
a, 1
couple, 1
of, 1
hours, 1
he, 1
returned., 1
Two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
men, 1
from, 1
Jacopo's, 1
boat, 1
came, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
to, 1
assist, 1
in, 1
navigating, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
orders, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
be, 1
steered, 1
direct, 1
to, 1
Marseilles., 1
For, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
death, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
some, 1
manner, 1
prepared;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
how, 1
to, 1
account, 1
for, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
disappearance, 1
of, 1
Mercedes., 1
Without, 1
divulging, 1
his, 1
secret,, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
give, 1
sufficiently, 1
clear, 1
instructions, 1
to, 1
an, 1
agent., 1
There, 1
were,, 1
besides,, 1
other, 1
particulars, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
ascertaining,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
were, 1
of, 1
a, 1
nature, 1
he, 1
alone, 1
could, 1
investigate, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
satisfactory, 1
to, 1
himself., 1
His, 1
looking-glass, 1
had, 1
assured, 1
him,, 1
during, 1
his, 1
stay, 1
at, 1
Leghorn,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
ran, 1
no, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
recognition;, 1
moreover,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
now, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
adopting, 1
any, 1
disguise, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
proper., 1
One, 1
fine, 1
morning,, 1
then,, 1
his, 1
yacht,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
little, 1
fishing-boat,, 1
boldly, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
port, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
anchored, 1
exactly, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
from, 1
whence,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
never-to-be-forgotten, 1
night, 1
of, 1
his, 1
departure, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
put, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
destined, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
him, 1
thither., 1
Still, 1
Dantes, 1
could, 1
not, 1
view, 1
without, 1
a, 1
shudder, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
who, 1
accompanied, 1
the, 1
officers, 1
deputed, 1
to, 1
demand, 1
his, 1
bill, 1
of, 1
health, 1
ere, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
was, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
communication, 1
with, 1
the, 1
shore;, 1
but, 1
with, 1
that, 1
perfect, 1
self-possession, 1
he, 1
had, 1
acquired, 1
during, 1
his, 1
acquaintance, 1
with, 1
Faria,, 1
Dantes, 1
coolly, 1
presented, 1
an, 1
English, 1
passport, 1
he, 1
had, 1
obtained, 1
from, 1
Leghorn,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
this, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
a, 1
standing, 1
which, 1
a, 1
French, 1
passport, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
afforded,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
there, 1
existed, 1
no, 1
obstacle, 1
to, 1
his, 1
immediate, 1
debarkation., 1
The, 1
first, 1
person, 1
to, 1
attract, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
landed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Canebiere,, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Pharaon., 1
Edmond, 1
welcomed, 1
the, 1
meeting, 1
with, 1
this, 1
fellow--who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
sailors--as, 1
a, 1
sure, 1
means, 1
of, 1
testing, 1
the, 1
extent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
change, 1
which, 1
time, 1
had, 1
worked, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
appearance., 1
Going, 1
straight, 1
towards, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
propounded, 1
a, 1
variety, 1
of, 1
questions, 1
on, 1
different, 1
subjects,, 1
carefully, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
man's, 1
countenance, 1
as, 1
he, 1
did, 1
so;, 1
but, 1
not, 1
a, 1
word, 1
or, 1
look, 1
implied, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
ever, 1
having, 1
seen, 1
before, 1
the, 1
person, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
then, 1
conversing., 1
Giving, 1
the, 1
sailor, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
money, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
his, 1
civility,, 1
Dantes, 1
proceeded, 1
onwards;, 1
but, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
many, 1
steps, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
man, 1
loudly, 1
calling, 1
him, 1
to, 1
stop., 1
Dantes, 1
instantly, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
pardon,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
honest, 1
fellow,, 1
in, 1
almost, 1
breathless, 1
haste,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
made, 1
a, 1
mistake;, 1
you, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
two-franc, 1
piece,, 1
and, 1
see,, 1
you, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
double, 1
Napoleon.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
friend., 1
I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
trifling, 1
mistake,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
rewarding, 1
your, 1
honesty, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
another, 1
double, 1
Napoleon,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
drink, 1
to, 1
my, 1
health,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
your, 1
messmates, 1
to, 1
join, 1
you.", 1
So, 1
extreme, 1
was, 1
the, 1
surprise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sailor,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
even, 1
to, 1
thank, 1
Edmond,, 1
whose, 1
receding, 1
figure, 1
he, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
gaze, 1
after, 1
in, 1
speechless, 1
astonishment., 1
"Some, 1
nabob, 1
from, 1
India,", 1
was, 1
his, 1
comment., 1
Dantes,, 1
meanwhile,, 1
went, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way., 1
Each, 1
step, 1
he, 1
trod, 1
oppressed, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
with, 1
fresh, 1
emotion;, 1
his, 1
first, 1
and, 1
most, 1
indelible, 1
recollections, 1
were, 1
there;, 1
not, 1
a, 1
tree,, 1
not, 1
a, 1
street,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
but, 1
seemed, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
dear, 1
and, 1
cherished, 1
memories., 1
And, 1
thus, 1
he, 1
proceeded, 1
onwards, 1
till, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Noailles,, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
a, 1
full, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan, 1
was, 1
obtained., 1
At, 1
this, 1
spot,, 1
so, 1
pregnant, 1
with, 1
fond, 1
and, 1
filial, 1
remembrances,, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
bursting,, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
tottered, 1
under, 1
him,, 1
a, 1
mist, 1
floated, 1
over, 1
his, 1
sight,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
he, 1
not, 1
clung, 1
for, 1
support, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
inevitably, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
and, 1
been, 1
crushed, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
many, 1
vehicles, 1
continually, 1
passing, 1
there., 1
Recovering, 1
himself,, 1
however,, 1
he, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brows,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
not, 1
again, 1
till, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
which, 1
his, 1
father, 1
had, 1
lived., 1
The, 1
nasturtiums, 1
and, 1
other, 1
plants,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
father, 1
had, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
train, 1
before, 1
his, 1
window,, 1
had, 1
all, 1
disappeared, 1
from, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
Leaning, 1
against, 1
the, 1
tree,, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
thoughtfully, 1
for, 1
a, 1
time, 1
at, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
stories, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shabby, 1
little, 1
house., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
whether, 1
there, 1
were, 1
any, 1
rooms, 1
to, 1
be, 1
let., 1
Though, 1
answered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
negative,, 1
he, 1
begged, 1
so, 1
earnestly, 1
to, 1
be, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
those, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
floor,, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
despite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oft-repeated, 1
assurance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
occupied,, 1
Dantes, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
inducing, 1
the, 1
man, 1
to, 1
go, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
tenants,, 1
and, 1
ask, 1
permission, 1
for, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
to, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
look, 1
at, 1
them., 1
The, 1
tenants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
humble, 1
lodging, 1
were, 1
a, 1
young, 1
couple, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
scarcely, 1
married, 1
a, 1
week;, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
them,, 1
Dantes, 1
sighed, 1
heavily., 1
Nothing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
two, 1
small, 1
chambers, 1
forming, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
remained, 1
as, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
Dantes;, 1
the, 1
very, 1
paper, 1
was, 1
different,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
articles, 1
of, 1
antiquated, 1
furniture, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
had, 1
been, 1
filled, 1
in, 1
Edmond's, 1
time, 1
had, 1
all, 1
disappeared;, 1
the, 1
four, 1
walls, 1
alone, 1
remained, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
them., 1
The, 1
bed, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
present, 1
occupants, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
as, 1
the, 1
former, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
had, 1
been, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
his;, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
efforts, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
it,, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Edmond, 1
were, 1
suffused, 1
in, 1
tears, 1
as, 1
he, 1
reflected, 1
that, 1
on, 1
that, 1
spot, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
had, 1
breathed, 1
his, 1
last,, 1
vainly, 1
calling, 1
for, 1
his, 1
son., 1
The, 1
young, 1
couple, 1
gazed, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
their, 1
visitor's, 1
emotion,, 1
and, 1
wondered, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
large, 1
tears, 1
silently, 1
chasing, 1
each, 1
other, 1
down, 1
his, 1
otherwise, 1
stern, 1
and, 1
immovable, 1
features;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
sacredness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
grief,, 1
and, 1
kindly, 1
refrained, 1
from, 1
questioning, 1
him, 1
as, 1
to, 1
its, 1
cause,, 1
while,, 1
with, 1
instinctive, 1
delicacy,, 1
they, 1
left, 1
him, 1
to, 1
indulge, 1
his, 1
sorrow, 1
alone., 1
When, 1
he, 1
withdrew, 1
from, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
his, 1
painful, 1
recollections,, 1
they, 1
both, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
downstairs,, 1
reiterating, 1
their, 1
hope, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
come, 1
again, 1
whenever, 1
he, 1
pleased,, 1
and, 1
assuring, 1
him, 1
that, 1
their, 1
poor, 1
dwelling, 1
would, 1
ever, 1
be, 1
open, 1
to, 1
him., 1
As, 1
Edmond, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
floor,, 1
he, 1
paused, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
whether, 1
Caderousse, 1
the, 1
tailor, 1
still, 1
dwelt, 1
there;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
received,, 1
for, 1
reply,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
person, 1
in, 1
question, 1
had, 1
got, 1
into, 1
difficulties,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
present, 1
time, 1
kept, 1
a, 1
small, 1
inn, 1
on, 1
the, 1
route, 1
from, 1
Bellegarde, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire., 1
Having, 1
obtained, 1
the, 1
address, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan, 1
belonged,, 1
Dantes, 1
next, 1
proceeded, 1
thither,, 1
and,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
(the, 1
name, 1
and, 1
title, 1
inscribed, 1
on, 1
his, 1
passport),, 1
purchased, 1
the, 1
small, 1
dwelling, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
twenty-five, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
ten, 1
thousand, 1
more, 1
than, 1
it, 1
was, 1
worth;, 1
but, 1
had, 1
its, 1
owner, 1
asked, 1
half, 1
a, 1
million,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
unhesitatingly, 1
have, 1
been, 1
given., 1
The, 1
very, 1
same, 1
day, 1
the, 1
occupants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
now, 1
become, 1
the, 1
property, 1
of, 1
Dantes,, 1
were, 1
duly, 1
informed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
who, 1
had, 1
arranged, 1
the, 1
necessary, 1
transfer, 1
of, 1
deeds,, 1
etc.,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
new, 1
landlord, 1
gave, 1
them, 1
their, 1
choice, 1
of, 1
any, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
least, 1
augmentation, 1
of, 1
rent,, 1
upon, 1
condition, 1
of, 1
their, 1
giving, 1
instant, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
small, 1
chambers, 1
they, 1
at, 1
present, 1
inhabited., 1
This, 1
strange, 1
event, 1
aroused, 1
great, 1
wonder, 1
and, 1
curiosity, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
theories, 1
were, 1
afloat,, 1
none, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
anywhere, 1
near, 1
the, 1
truth., 1
But, 1
what, 1
raised, 1
public, 1
astonishment, 1
to, 1
a, 1
climax,, 1
and, 1
set, 1
all, 1
conjecture, 1
at, 1
defiance,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
that, 1
the, 1
same, 1
stranger, 1
who, 1
had, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
visited, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan, 1
had, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
walking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
little, 1
village, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
and, 1
afterwards, 1
observed, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
fisherman's, 1
hut,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
more, 1
than, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
in, 1
inquiring, 1
after, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
had, 1
either, 1
been, 1
dead, 1
or, 1
gone, 1
away, 1
for, 1
more, 1
than, 1
fifteen, 1
or, 1
sixteen, 1
years., 1
But, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day, 1
the, 1
family, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
all, 1
these, 1
particulars, 1
had, 1
been, 1
asked, 1
received, 1
a, 1
handsome, 1
present,, 1
consisting, 1
of, 1
an, 1
entirely, 1
new, 1
fishing-boat,, 1
with, 1
two, 1
seines, 1
and, 1
a, 1
tender., 1
The, 1
delighted, 1
recipients, 1
of, 1
these, 1
munificent, 1
gifts, 1
would, 1
gladly, 1
have, 1
poured, 1
out, 1
their, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
their, 1
generous, 1
benefactor,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
him,, 1
upon, 1
quitting, 1
the, 1
hut,, 1
merely, 1
give, 1
some, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sailor,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
springing, 1
lightly, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
leave, 1
Marseilles, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porte, 1
d'Aix., 1
Chapter, 1

The, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard, 1
Inn., 1
Such, 1
of, 1
my, 1
readers, 1
as, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
pedestrian, 1
excursion, 1
to, 1
the, 1
south, 1
of, 1
France, 1
may, 1
perchance, 1
have, 1
noticed,, 1
about, 1
midway, 1
between, 1
the, 1
town, 1
of, 1
Beaucaire, 1
and, 1
the, 1
village, 1
of, 1
Bellegarde,--a, 1
little, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
the, 1
former, 1
than, 1
to, 1
the, 1
latter,--a, 1
small, 1
roadside, 1
inn,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
which, 1
hung,, 1
creaking, 1
and, 1
flapping, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wind,, 1
a, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
tin, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
grotesque, 1
representation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard., 1
This, 1
modern, 1
place, 1
of, 1
entertainment, 1
stood, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left-hand, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
post, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
backed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
Rhone., 1
It, 1
also, 1
boasted, 1
of, 1
what, 1
in, 1
Languedoc, 1
is, 1
styled, 1
a, 1
garden,, 1
consisting, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
plot, 1
of, 1
ground,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
side, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
the, 1
main, 1
entrance, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
the, 1
reception, 1
of, 1
guests., 1
A, 1
few, 1
dingy, 1
olives, 1
and, 1
stunted, 1
fig-trees, 1
struggled, 1
hard, 1
for, 1
existence,, 1
but, 1
their, 1
withered, 1
dusty, 1
foliage, 1
abundantly, 1
proved, 1
how, 1
unequal, 1
was, 1
the, 1
conflict., 1
Between, 1
these, 1
sickly, 1
shrubs, 1
grew, 1
a, 1
scanty, 1
supply, 1
of, 1
garlic,, 1
tomatoes,, 1
and, 1
eschalots;, 1
while,, 1
lone, 1
and, 1
solitary,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
forgotten, 1
sentinel,, 1
a, 1
tall, 1
pine, 1
raised, 1
its, 1
melancholy, 1
head, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corners, 1
of, 1
this, 1
unattractive, 1
spot,, 1
and, 1
displayed, 1
its, 1
flexible, 1
stem, 1
and, 1
fan-shaped, 1
summit, 1
dried, 1
and, 1
cracked, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fierce, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sub-tropical, 1
sun., 1
In, 1
the, 1
surrounding, 1
plain,, 1
which, 1
more, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
dusty, 1
lake, 1
than, 1
solid, 1
ground,, 1
were, 1
scattered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
miserable, 1
stalks, 1
of, 1
wheat,, 1
the, 1
effect,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
curious, 1
desire, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agriculturists, 1
of, 1
the, 1
country, 1
to, 1
see, 1
whether, 1
such, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
as, 1
the, 1
raising, 1
of, 1
grain, 1
in, 1
those, 1
parched, 1
regions, 1
was, 1
practicable., 1
Each, 1
stalk, 1
served, 1
as, 1
a, 1
perch, 1
for, 1
a, 1
grasshopper,, 1
which, 1
regaled, 1
the, 1
passers, 1
by, 1
through, 1
this, 1
Egyptian, 1
scene, 1
with, 1
its, 1
strident,, 1
monotonous, 1
note., 1
For, 1
about, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
years, 1
the, 1
little, 1
tavern, 1
had, 1
been, 1
kept, 1
by, 1
a, 1
man, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
with, 1
two, 1
servants,--a, 1
chambermaid, 1
named, 1
Trinette,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hostler, 1
called, 1
Pecaud., 1
This, 1
small, 1
staff, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
all, 1
the, 1
requirements,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
canal, 1
between, 1
Beaucaire, 1
and, 1
Aiguemortes, 1
had, 1
revolutionized, 1
transportation, 1
by, 1
substituting, 1
boats, 1
for, 1
the, 1
cart, 1
and, 1
the, 1
stagecoach., 1
And,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
add, 1
to, 1
the, 1
daily, 1
misery, 1
which, 1
this, 1
prosperous, 1
canal, 1
inflicted, 1
on, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
inn-keeper,, 1
whose, 1
utter, 1
ruin, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fast, 1
accomplishing,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Rhone, 1
from, 1
which, 1
it, 1
had, 1
its, 1
source, 1
and, 1
the, 1
post-road, 1
it, 1
had, 1
depleted,, 1
not, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
steps, 1
from, 1
the, 1
inn,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
given, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
but, 1
faithful, 1
description., 1
The, 1
inn-keeper, 1
himself, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
from, 1
forty, 1
to, 1
fifty-five, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
tall,, 1
strong,, 1
and, 1
bony,, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
natives, 1
of, 1
those, 1
southern, 1
latitudes;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
dark,, 1
sparkling,, 1
and, 1
deep-set, 1
eyes,, 1
hooked, 1
nose,, 1
and, 1
teeth, 1
white, 1
as, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
carnivorous, 1
animal;, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
like, 1
his, 1
beard,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
wore, 1
under, 1
his, 1
chin,, 1
was, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
curly,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
age, 1
but, 1
slightly, 1
interspersed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
few, 1
silvery, 1
threads., 1
His, 1
naturally, 1
dark, 1
complexion, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
a, 1
still, 1
further, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
brown, 1
from, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
man, 1
had, 1
acquired, 1
of, 1
stationing, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
morning, 1
till, 1
eve, 1
at, 1
the, 1
threshold, 1
of, 1
his, 1
door,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lookout, 1
for, 1
guests, 1
who, 1
seldom, 1
came,, 1
yet, 1
there, 1
he, 1
stood,, 1
day, 1
after, 1
day,, 1
exposed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
meridional, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
a, 1
burning, 1
sun,, 1
with, 1
no, 1
other, 1
protection, 1
for, 1
his, 1
head, 1
than, 1
a, 1
red, 1
handkerchief, 1
twisted, 1
around, 1
it,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
muleteers., 1
This, 1
man, 1
was, 1
our, 1
old, 1
acquaintance,, 1
Gaspard, 1
Caderousse., 1
His, 1
wife,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
whose, 1
maiden, 1
name, 1
had, 1
been, 1
Madeleine, 1
Radelle,, 1
was, 1
pale,, 1
meagre,, 1
and, 1
sickly-looking., 1
Born, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
Arles,, 1
she, 1
had, 1
shared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
for, 1
which, 1
its, 1
women, 1
are, 1
proverbial;, 1
but, 1
that, 1
beauty, 1
had, 1
gradually, 1
withered, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
devastating, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
slow, 1
fever, 1
so, 1
prevalent, 1
among, 1
dwellers, 1
by, 1
the, 1
ponds, 1
of, 1
Aiguemortes, 1
and, 1
the, 1
marshes, 1
of, 1
Camargue., 1
She, 1
remained, 1
nearly, 1
always, 1
in, 1
her, 1
second-floor, 1
chamber,, 1
shivering, 1
in, 1
her, 1
chair,, 1
or, 1
stretched, 1
languid, 1
and, 1
feeble, 1
on, 1
her, 1
bed,, 1
while, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
daily, 1
watch, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door--a, 1
duty, 1
he, 1
performed, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
greater, 1
willingness,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
saved, 1
him, 1
the, 1
necessity, 1
of, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
the, 1
endless, 1
plaints, 1
and, 1
murmurs, 1
of, 1
his, 1
helpmate,, 1
who, 1
never, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
without, 1
breaking, 1
out, 1
into, 1
bitter, 1
invectives, 1
against, 1
fate;, 1
to, 1
all, 1
of, 1
which, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
would, 1
calmly, 1
return, 1
an, 1
unvarying, 1
reply,, 1
in, 1
these, 1
philosophic, 1
words:--, 1
"Hush,, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
It, 1
is, 1
God's, 1
pleasure, 1
that, 1
things, 1
should, 1
be, 1
so.", 1
The, 1
sobriquet, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
had, 1
been, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
Madeleine, 1
Radelle, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
been, 1
born, 1
in, 1
a, 1
village,, 1
so, 1
called,, 1
situated, 1
between, 1
Salon, 1
and, 1
Lambesc;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
a, 1
custom, 1
existed, 1
among, 1
the, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
France, 1
where, 1
Caderousse, 1
lived, 1
of, 1
styling, 1
every, 1
person, 1
by, 1
some, 1
particular, 1
and, 1
distinctive, 1
appellation,, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
had, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
her, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
her, 1
sweet, 1
and, 1
euphonious, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Madeleine,, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
his, 1
rude, 1
gutteral, 1
language, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
pronounce., 1
Still,, 1
let, 1
it, 1
not, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
that, 1
amid, 1
this, 1
affected, 1
resignation, 1
to, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
Providence,, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
inn-keeper, 1
did, 1
not, 1
writhe, 1
under, 1
the, 1
double, 1
misery, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
hateful, 1
canal, 1
carry, 1
off, 1
his, 1
customers, 1
and, 1
his, 1
profits,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
daily, 1
infliction, 1
of, 1
his, 1
peevish, 1
partner's, 1
murmurs, 1
and, 1
lamentations., 1
Like, 1
other, 1
dwellers, 1
in, 1
the, 1
south,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
sober, 1
habits, 1
and, 1
moderate, 1
desires,, 1
but, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
external, 1
show,, 1
vain,, 1
and, 1
addicted, 1
to, 1
display., 1
During, 1
the, 1
days, 1
of, 1
his, 1
prosperity,, 1
not, 1
a, 1
festivity, 1
took, 1
place, 1
without, 1
himself, 1
and, 1
wife, 1
being, 1
among, 1
the, 1
spectators., 1
He, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
picturesque, 1
costume, 1
worn, 1
upon, 1
grand, 1
occasions, 1
by, 1
the, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
south, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
bearing, 1
equal, 1
resemblance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
style, 1
adopted, 1
both, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Catalans, 1
and, 1
Andalusians;, 1
while, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
displayed, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
fashion, 1
prevalent, 1
among, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
Arles,, 1
a, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
attire, 1
borrowed, 1
equally, 1
from, 1
Greece, 1

Arabia., 1
But,, 1

disappeared;, 1
and, 1
Gaspard, 1
Caderousse,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
abroad, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pristine, 1
splendor,, 1
had, 1
given, 1
up, 1
any, 1
further, 1
participation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pomps, 1
and, 1
vanities,, 1
both, 1
for, 1
himself, 1
and, 1
wife,, 1
although, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
envious, 1
discontent, 1
filled, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
as, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
mirth, 1
and, 1
merry, 1
music, 1
from, 1
the, 1
joyous, 1
revellers, 1
reached, 1
even, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
hostelry, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
still, 1
clung,, 1
more, 1
for, 1
the, 1
shelter, 1
than, 1
the, 1
profit, 1
it, 1
afforded., 1
Caderousse,, 1
then,, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
at, 1
his, 1
place, 1
of, 1
observation, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
glancing, 1
listlessly, 1
from, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
closely, 1
shaven, 1
grass--on, 1
which, 1
some, 1
fowls, 1
were, 1
industriously,, 1
though, 1
fruitlessly,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
up, 1
some, 1
grain, 1
or, 1
insect, 1
suited, 1
to, 1
their, 1
palate--to, 1
the, 1
deserted, 1
road,, 1
which, 1
led, 1
away, 1
to, 1
the, 1
north, 1
and, 1
south,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
aroused, 1
by, 1
the, 1
shrill, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
and, 1
grumbling, 1
to, 1
himself, 1
as, 1
he, 1
went,, 1
he, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
her, 1
chamber,, 1
first, 1
taking, 1
care,, 1
however,, 1
to, 1
set, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
door, 1
wide, 1
open,, 1
as, 1
an, 1
invitation, 1
to, 1
any, 1

traveller, 1
who, 1
might, 1
be, 1
passing., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
Caderousse, 1
quitted, 1
his, 1
sentry-like, 1
watch, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
the, 1
road, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
so, 1
eagerly, 1
strained, 1
his, 1
sight, 1
was, 1
void, 1
and, 1
lonely, 1
as, 1
a, 1
desert, 1
at, 1
mid-day., 1
There, 1
it, 1
lay, 1
stretching, 1
out, 1
into, 1
one, 1
interminable, 1
line, 1
of, 1
dust, 1
and, 1
sand,, 1
with, 1
its, 1
sides, 1
bordered, 1
by, 1
tall,, 1
meagre, 1
trees,, 1
altogether, 1
presenting, 1
so, 1
uninviting, 1
an, 1
appearance,, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
in, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
could, 1
have, 1
imagined, 1
that, 1
any, 1
traveller,, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
regulate, 1
his, 1
hours, 1
for, 1
journeying,, 1
would, 1
choose, 1
to, 1
expose, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
formidable, 1
Sahara., 1
Nevertheless,, 1
had, 1
Caderousse, 1
but, 1
retained, 1
his, 1
post, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
longer,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
caught, 1
a, 1
dim, 1
outline, 1
of, 1
something, 1
approaching, 1
from, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Bellegarde;, 1
as, 1
the, 1
moving, 1
object, 1
drew, 1
nearer,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
easily, 1
have, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
it, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
and, 1
horse,, 1
between, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
kindest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
amiable, 1
understanding, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
exist., 1
The, 1
horse, 1
was, 1
of, 1
Hungarian, 1
breed,, 1
and, 1
ambled, 1
along, 1
at, 1
an, 1
easy, 1
pace., 1
His, 1
rider, 1
was, 1
a, 1
priest,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
and, 1
wearing, 1
a, 1
three-cornered, 1
hat;, 1
and,, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ardent, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
a, 1
noonday, 1
sun,, 1
the, 1
pair, 1
came, 1
on, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fair, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
rapidity., 1
Having, 1
arrived, 1
before, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard,, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
stopped,, 1
but, 1
whether, 1
for, 1
his, 1
own, 1
pleasure, 1
or, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
rider, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
say., 1
However, 1
that, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been,, 1
the, 1
priest,, 1
dismounting,, 1
led, 1
his, 1
steed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bridle, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
some, 1
place, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
secure, 1
him., 1
Availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
a, 1
handle, 1
that, 1
projected, 1
from, 1
a, 1
half-fallen, 1
door,, 1
he, 1
tied, 1
the, 1
animal, 1
safely, 1
and, 1
having, 1
drawn, 1
a, 1
red, 1
cotton, 1
handkerchief,, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
wiped, 1
away, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
that, 1
streamed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
then,, 1
advancing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
struck, 1
thrice, 1
with, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
his, 1
iron-shod, 1
stick., 1
At, 1
this, 1
unusual, 1
sound,, 1
a, 1
huge, 1
black, 1
dog, 1
came, 1
rushing, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
daring, 1
assailant, 1
of, 1
his, 1
ordinarily, 1
tranquil, 1
abode,, 1
snarling, 1
and, 1
displaying, 1
his, 1
sharp, 1
white, 1
teeth, 1
with, 1
a, 1
determined, 1
hostility, 1
that, 1
abundantly, 1
proved, 1
how, 1
little, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
society., 1
At, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
footstep, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
descending, 1
the, 1
wooden, 1
staircase, 1
that, 1
led, 1
from, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
floor,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
many, 1
bows, 1
and, 1
courteous, 1
smiles,, 1
mine, 1
host, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard, 1
besought, 1
his, 1
guest, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
welcome,, 1
sir,, 1
most, 1
welcome!", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
astonished, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Now,, 1
then,, 1
Margotin,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dog,, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
be, 1
quiet?, 1
Pray, 1
don't, 1
heed, 1
him,, 1
sir!--he, 1
only, 1
barks,, 1
he, 1
never, 1
bites., 1
I, 1
make, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
good, 1
wine, 1
would, 1
be, 1
acceptable, 1
this, 1
dreadfully, 1
hot, 1
day.", 1
Then, 1
perceiving, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
the, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
entertain,, 1
Caderousse, 1
hastily, 1
exclaimed:, 1
"A, 1
thousand, 1
pardons!, 1
I, 1
really, 1
did, 1
not, 1
observe, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
under, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
roof., 1
What, 1
would, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
please, 1
to, 1
have?, 1
What, 1
refreshment, 1
can, 1
I, 1
offer?, 1
All, 1
I, 1
have, 1
is, 1
at, 1
his, 1
service.", 1
The, 1
priest, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
person, 1
addressing, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
long, 1
and, 1
searching, 1
gaze--there, 1
even, 1
seemed, 1
a, 1
disposition, 1
on, 1
his, 1
part, 1
to, 1
court, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
scrutiny, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper;, 1
then,, 1
observing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
no, 1
other, 1
expression, 1
than, 1
extreme, 1
surprise, 1
at, 1
his, 1
own, 1
want, 1
of, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
an, 1
inquiry, 1
so, 1
courteously, 1
worded,, 1
he, 1
deemed, 1
it, 1
as, 1
well, 1
to, 1
terminate, 1
this, 1
dumb, 1
show,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
said,, 1
speaking, 1
with, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
Italian, 1
accent,, 1
"You, 1
are,, 1
I, 1
presume,, 1
M., 1
Caderousse?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
host,, 1
even, 1
more, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
the, 1
question, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
by, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
which, 1
had, 1
preceded, 1
it;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
Gaspard, 1
Caderousse,, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service.", 1
"Gaspard, 1
Caderousse,", 1
rejoined, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"Yes,--Christian, 1
and, 1
surname, 1
are, 1
the, 1
same., 1
You, 1
formerly, 1
lived,, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
floor?", 1
"I, 1
did.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tailor?", 1
"True,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tailor,, 1
till, 1
the, 1
trade, 1
fell, 1
off., 1
It, 1
is, 1
so, 1
hot, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
that, 1
really, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
the, 1
respectable, 1
inhabitants, 1
will, 1
in, 1
time, 1
go, 1
without, 1
any, 1
clothing, 1
whatever., 1
But, 1
talking, 1
of, 1
heat,, 1
is, 1
there, 1
nothing, 1
I, 1
can, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
refreshment?", 1
"Yes;, 1
let, 1
me, 1
have, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
your, 1
best, 1
wine,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
permission,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
resume, 1
our, 1
conversation, 1
from, 1
where, 1
we, 1
left, 1
off.", 1
"As, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who,, 1
anxious, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
the, 1
present, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
a, 1
customer, 1
for, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
few, 1
bottles, 1
of, 1
Cahors, 1
still, 1
remaining, 1
in, 1
his, 1
possession,, 1
hastily, 1
raised, 1
a, 1
trap-door, 1
in, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
they, 1
were, 1
in,, 1
which, 1
served, 1
both, 1
as, 1
parlor, 1
and, 1
kitchen., 1
Upon, 1
issuing, 1
forth, 1
from, 1
his, 1
subterranean, 1
retreat, 1
at, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
five, 1
minutes,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
seated, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
wooden, 1
stool,, 1
leaning, 1
his, 1
elbow, 1
on, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
while, 1
Margotin,, 1
whose, 1
animosity, 1
seemed, 1
appeased, 1
by, 1
the, 1
unusual, 1
command, 1
of, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
for, 1
refreshments,, 1
had, 1
crept, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
established, 1
himself, 1
very, 1
comfortably, 1
between, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
his, 1
long,, 1
skinny, 1
neck, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lap,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
dim, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
fixed, 1
earnestly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
traveller's, 1
face., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
quite, 1
alone?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
guest,, 1
as, 1
Caderousse, 1
placed, 1
before, 1
him, 1
the, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
and, 1
a, 1
glass., 1
"Quite,, 1
quite, 1
alone,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
man--"or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
practically, 1
so,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
wife,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
person, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house, 1
besides, 1
myself,, 1
is, 1
laid, 1
up, 1
with, 1
illness,, 1
and, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
render, 1
me, 1
the, 1
least, 1
assistance,, 1
poor, 1
thing!", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
married,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
show, 1
of, 1
interest,, 1
glancing, 1
round, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
at, 1
the, 1
scanty, 1
furnishings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
man;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world, 1
a, 1
man, 1
does, 1
not, 1
thrive, 1
the, 1
better, 1
for, 1
being, 1
honest.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
a, 1
searching,, 1
penetrating, 1
glance., 1
"Yes,, 1
honest--I, 1
can, 1
certainly, 1
say, 1
that, 1
much, 1
for, 1
myself,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper,, 1
fairly, 1
sustaining, 1
the, 1
scrutiny, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
gaze;, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
boast, 1
with, 1
truth, 1
of, 1
being, 1
an, 1
honest, 1
man;, 1
and,", 1
continued, 1
he, 1
significantly,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
his, 1
breast, 1
and, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
every, 1
one, 1
can, 1
say, 1
nowadays.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
if, 1
what, 1
you, 1
assert, 1
be, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
firmly, 1
persuaded, 1
that,, 1
sooner, 1
or, 1
later,, 1
the, 1
good, 1
will, 1
be, 1
rewarded,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
punished.", 1
"Such, 1
words, 1
as, 1
those, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
your, 1
profession,", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
do, 1
well, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
them;, 1
but,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
countenance,, 1
"one, 1
is, 1
free, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
them, 1
or, 1
not,, 1
as, 1
one, 1
pleases.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
wrong, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
thus,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"and, 1
perhaps, 1
I, 1
may,, 1
in, 1
my, 1
own, 1
person,, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
you, 1
how, 1
completely, 1
you, 1
are, 1
in, 1
error.", 1
"What, 1
mean, 1
you?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
surprise., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
satisfied, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
person, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of.", 1
"What, 1
proofs, 1
do, 1
you, 1
require?", 1
"Did, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
year, 1
1814, 1
or, 1
1815,, 1
know, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
sailor, 1
named, 1
Dantes?", 1
"Dantes?, 1
Did, 1
I, 1
know, 1
poor, 1
dear, 1
Edmond?, 1
Why,, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes, 1
and, 1
myself, 1
were, 1
intimate, 1
friends!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Caderousse,, 1
whose, 1
countenance, 1
flushed, 1
darkly, 1
as, 1
he, 1
caught, 1
the, 1
penetrating, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
clear,, 1
calm, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
questioner, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
dilate, 1
with, 1
feverish, 1
scrutiny., 1
"You, 1
remind, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
concerning, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
asked, 1
you, 1
was, 1
said, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Edmond.", 1
"Said, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
the, 1
name!", 1
repeated, 1
Caderousse,, 1
becoming, 1
excited, 1
and, 1
eager., 1
"Why,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
so, 1
called, 1
as, 1
truly, 1
as, 1
I, 1
myself, 1
bore, 1
the, 1
appellation, 1
of, 1
Gaspard, 1
Caderousse;, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
pray,, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Edmond?, 1
Did, 1
you, 1
know, 1
him?, 1
Is, 1
he, 1
alive, 1
and, 1
at, 1
liberty?, 1
Is, 1
he, 1
prosperous, 1
and, 1
happy?", 1
"He, 1
died, 1
a, 1
more, 1
wretched,, 1
hopeless,, 1
heart-broken, 1
prisoner, 1
than, 1
the, 1
felons, 1
who, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
penalty, 1
of, 1
their, 1
crimes, 1
at, 1
the, 1
galleys, 1
of, 1
Toulon.", 1
A, 1
deadly, 1
pallor, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
flush, 1
on, 1
the, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
turned, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
wiping, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
red, 1
handkerchief, 1
twisted, 1
round, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Poor, 1
fellow,, 1
poor, 1
fellow!", 1
murmured, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Well,, 1
there,, 1
sir,, 1
is, 1
another, 1
proof, 1
that, 1
good, 1
people, 1

never, 1

on, 1
this, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
none, 1
but, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
prosper., 1
Ah,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
speaking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
highly, 1
colored, 1
language, 1
of, 1
the, 1
south,, 1
"the, 1
world, 1
grows, 1
worse, 1
and, 1
worse., 1
Why, 1
does, 1
not, 1
God,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
really, 1
hates, 1
the, 1
wicked,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
is, 1
said, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
send, 1
down, 1
brimstone, 1
and, 1
fire,, 1
and, 1
consume, 1
them, 1
altogether?", 1
"You, 1
speak, 1
as, 1
though, 1
you, 1
had, 1
loved, 1
this, 1
young, 1
Dantes,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
without, 1
taking, 1
any, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companion's, 1
vehemence., 1
"And, 1
so, 1
I, 1
did,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"though, 1
once,, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
I, 1
envied, 1
him, 1
his, 1
good, 1
fortune., 1
But, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
by, 1
everything, 1
a, 1
man, 1
holds, 1
dear,, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
since, 1
then,, 1
deeply, 1
and, 1
sincerely, 1
lamented, 1
his, 1
unhappy, 1
fate.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
the, 1
fixed,, 1
searching, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
scrutinizing, 1
the, 1
agitated, 1
features, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper., 1
"You, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
lad,, 1
then?", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
called, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him, 1
on, 1
his, 1
dying, 1
bed,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
administer, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
consolations, 1
of, 1
religion.", 1
"And, 1
of, 1
what, 1
did, 1
he, 1
die?", 1
asked, 1
Caderousse, 1
in, 1
a, 1
choking, 1
voice., 1
"Of, 1
what,, 1
think, 1
you,, 1
do, 1
young, 1
and, 1
strong, 1
men, 1
die, 1
in, 1
prison,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
have, 1
scarcely, 1
numbered, 1
their, 1
thirtieth, 1
year,, 1
unless, 1
it, 1
be, 1
of, 1
imprisonment?", 1
Caderousse, 1
wiped, 1
away, 1
the, 1
large, 1
beads, 1
of, 1
perspiration, 1
that, 1
gathered, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
"But, 1
the, 1
strangest, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
story, 1
is,", 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
Dantes,, 1
even, 1
in, 1
his, 1
dying, 1
moments,, 1
swore, 1
by, 1
his, 1
crucified, 1
Redeemer,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
utterly, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
detention.", 1
"And, 1
so, 1
he, 1
was,", 1
murmured, 1
Caderousse., 1
"How, 1
should, 1
he, 1
have, 1
been, 1
otherwise?, 1
Ah,, 1
sir,, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
fellow, 1
told, 1
you, 1
the, 1
truth.", 1
"And, 1
for, 1
that, 1
reason,, 1
he, 1
besought, 1
me, 1
to, 1
try, 1
and, 1
clear, 1
up, 1
a, 1
mystery, 1
he, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
penetrate,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
clear, 1
his, 1
memory, 1
should, 1
any, 1
foul, 1
spot, 1
or, 1
stain, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
it.", 1
And, 1
here, 1
the, 1
look, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
becoming, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
fixed,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
rest, 1
with, 1
ill-concealed, 1
satisfaction, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
depression, 1
which, 1
was, 1
rapidly, 1
spreading, 1
over, 1
the, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
"A, 1
rich, 1
Englishman,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
in, 1
misfortune,, 1

had, 1
been, 1
released, 1
from, 1

the, 1
second, 1
restoration,, 1

possessed, 1
of, 1
a, 1
diamond, 1
of, 1
immense, 1
value;, 1
this, 1
jewel, 1
he, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
Dantes, 1
upon, 1
himself, 1
quitting, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
his, 1
gratitude, 1
for, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
and, 1
brotherly, 1
care, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
nursed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
severe, 1
illness, 1
he, 1
underwent, 1
during, 1
his, 1
confinement., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
employing, 1
this, 1
diamond, 1
in, 1
attempting, 1
to, 1
bribe, 1
his, 1
jailers,, 1
who, 1
might, 1
only, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
it, 1
and, 1
then, 1
betrayed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor,, 1
Dantes, 1
carefully, 1
preserved, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
in, 1
the, 1
event, 1
of, 1
his, 1
getting, 1
out, 1
of, 1
prison, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
wherewithal, 1
to, 1
live,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sale, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
diamond, 1
would, 1
have, 1
quite, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
make, 1
his, 1
fortune.", 1
"Then,, 1
I, 1
suppose,", 1
asked, 1
Caderousse,, 1
with, 1
eager,, 1
glowing, 1
looks,, 1
"that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
of, 1
immense, 1
value?", 1
"Why,, 1
everything, 1
is, 1
relative,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"To, 1
one, 1
in, 1
Edmond's, 1
position, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
certainly, 1
was, 1
of, 1
great, 1
value., 1
It, 1
was, 1
estimated, 1
at, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs.", 1
"Bless, 1
me!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs!, 1
Surely, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
was, 1
as, 1
large, 1
as, 1
a, 1
nut, 1
to, 1
be, 1
worth, 1
all, 1
that.", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
size, 1
as, 1
that;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
judge, 1
for, 1
yourself., 1
I, 1
have, 1
it, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
sharp, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
instantly, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
priest's, 1
garments,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
location, 1
of, 1
the, 1
treasure., 1
Calmly, 1
drawing, 1
forth, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
small, 1
box, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
black, 1
shagreen,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
displayed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dazzled, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Caderousse, 1
the, 1
sparkling, 1
jewel, 1
it, 1
contained,, 1
set, 1
in, 1
a, 1
ring, 1
of, 1
admirable, 1
workmanship., 1
"And, 1
that, 1
diamond,", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
almost, 1
breathless, 1
with, 1
eager, 1
admiration,, 1
"you, 1
say,, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs?", 1
"It, 1
is,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
setting,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
also, 1
valuable,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
while, 1
its, 1
brilliant, 1
hues, 1
seemed, 1
still, 1
to, 1
dance, 1
before, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fascinated, 1
inn-keeper., 1
"But, 1
how, 1
comes, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
in, 1
your, 1
possession,, 1
sir?, 1
Did, 1
Edmond, 1
make, 1
you, 1

"No,, 1

The, 1
inn-keeper, 1
shivered., 1
"'Another, 1
of, 1
the, 1
number,'", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
without, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
emotion, 1
of, 1

A, 1
fiendish, 1
smile, 1
played, 1
over, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
break, 1
in, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
speech,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
waving, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1

"Mercedes,", 1

Caderousse, 1
eagerly., 1
"True,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stifled, 1
sigh,, 1
"Mercedes, 1
it, 1

"Go, 1
on,", 1
urged, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Bring, 1
me, 1
a, 1
carafe, 1
of, 1
water,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
Caderousse, 1
quickly, 1
performed, 1
the, 1
stranger's, 1
bidding;, 1
and, 1
after, 1
pouring, 1
some, 1
into, 1
a, 1
glass,, 1

slowly, 1
swallowing, 1
its, 1
contents,, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
resuming, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
placidity, 1
of, 1
manner,, 1
said,, 1

placed, 1
his, 1
empty, 1
glass, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,--"Where, 1

we, 1
leave, 1
off?", 1

"To, 1

listened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
foregoing, 1
conversation., 1
"Mind, 1
your, 1
own, 1
business,, 1
wife,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse, 1
sharply., 1
"This, 1
gentleman, 1
asks, 1
me, 1
for, 1
information,, 1
which, 1
common, 1
politeness, 1
will, 1
not, 1
permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
refuse.", 1
"Politeness,, 1
you, 1
simpleton!", 1
retorted, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
"What, 1
have, 1
you, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
politeness,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
know?, 1
Better, 1
study, 1
a, 1
little, 1
common, 1
prudence., 1
How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
motives, 1
that, 1
person, 1
may, 1
have, 1
for, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
extract, 1
all, 1
he, 1
can, 1
from, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
pledge, 1
you, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
madam,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
my, 1
intentions, 1
are, 1
good;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
husband, 1
can, 1
incur, 1
no, 1
risk,, 1
provided, 1
he, 1
answers, 1
me, 1
candidly.", 1
"Ah,, 1
that's, 1
all, 1
very, 1
fine,", 1
retorted, 1
the, 1
woman., 1
"Nothing, 1
is, 1
easier, 1
than, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
with, 1
fair, 1
promises, 1
and, 1
assurances, 1
of, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
fear;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
poor,, 1
silly, 1
folks,, 1
like, 1
my, 1
husband, 1
there,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
persuaded, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
all, 1
they, 1
know,, 1
the, 1
promises, 1
and, 1
assurances, 1
of, 1
safety, 1
are, 1
quickly, 1
forgotten;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
some, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
nobody, 1
is, 1
expecting, 1
it,, 1
behold, 1
trouble, 1
and, 1
misery,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
sorts, 1
of, 1
persecutions,, 1
are, 1
heaped, 1
on, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
wretches,, 1
who, 1
cannot, 1
even, 1
see, 1
whence, 1
all, 1
their, 1
afflictions, 1
come.", 1
"Nay,, 1
nay,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
woman,, 1
make, 1
yourself, 1
perfectly, 1
easy,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you., 1
Whatever, 1
evils, 1
may, 1
befall, 1
you,, 1
they, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
my, 1
instrumentality,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
solemnly, 1
promise, 1
you.", 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
muttered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
inarticulate, 1
words,, 1
then, 1
let, 1
her, 1
head, 1
again, 1
drop, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
into, 1
a, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
ague,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
two, 1
speakers, 1
to, 1
resume, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
but, 1
remaining, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
every, 1
word, 1
they, 1
uttered., 1
Again, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
been, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
swallow, 1
a, 1
draught, 1
of, 1
water, 1
to, 1
calm, 1
the, 1
emotions, 1
that, 1
threatened, 1
to, 1
overpower, 1
him., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
sufficiently, 1
recovered, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"It, 1
appears,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
old, 1
man, 1
you, 1
were, 1
telling, 1
me, 1
of, 1
was, 1
forsaken, 1
by, 1
every, 1
one., 1
Surely,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
such, 1
been, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
perished, 1
by, 1
so, 1
dreadful, 1
a, 1
death.", 1
"Why,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
altogether, 1
forsaken,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"for, 1
Mercedes, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
and, 1
Monsieur, 1
Morrel, 1
were, 1
very, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
somehow, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
man, 1
had, 1
contracted, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
hatred, 1
for, 1
Fernand--the, 1
very, 1
person,", 1
added, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
smile,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
named, 1
just, 1
now, 1
as, 1
being, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Dantes', 1
faithful, 1
and, 1
attached, 1
friends.", 1
"And, 1
was, 1
he, 1
not, 1
so?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Gaspard,, 1
Gaspard!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
woman,, 1
from, 1
her, 1
seat, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
"mind, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
saying!", 1
Caderousse, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
though, 1
evidently, 1
irritated, 1
and, 1
annoyed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
interruption,, 1
but,, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
said,, 1
"Can, 1
a, 1
man, 1
be, 1
faithful, 1
to, 1
another, 1
whose, 1
wife, 1
he, 1
covets, 1
and, 1
desires, 1
for, 1
himself?, 1
But, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
so, 1
honorable, 1
and, 1
true, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
nature,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
everybody's, 1
professions, 1
of, 1
friendship., 1
Poor, 1
Edmond,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
cruelly, 1
deceived;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fortunate, 1
that, 1
he, 1
never, 1
knew,, 1
or, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
found, 1
it, 1
more, 1
difficult,, 1
when, 1
on, 1
his, 1
deathbed,, 1
to, 1
pardon, 1
his, 1
enemies., 1
And,, 1
whatever, 1
people, 1
may, 1
say,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
native, 1
language,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
altogether, 1
devoid, 1
of, 1
rude, 1
poetry,, 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
being, 1
more, 1
frightened, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
malediction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
than, 1
the, 1
hatred, 1
of, 1
the, 1
living.", 1
"Imbecile!", 1
exclaimed, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
"Do, 1
you,, 1
then,, 1
know, 1
in, 1
what, 1
manner, 1
Fernand, 1
injured, 1
Dantes?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Do, 1
I?, 1
No, 1
one, 1
better.", 1
"Speak, 1
out, 1
then,, 1
say, 1
what, 1
it, 1
was!", 1
"Gaspard!", 1
cried, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
"do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
will;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
master--but, 1
if, 1
you, 1
take, 1
my, 1
advice, 1
you'll, 1
hold, 1
your, 1
tongue.", 1
"Well,, 1
wife,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
but, 1
what, 1
you're, 1
right!", 1
"So, 1
you, 1
will, 1
say, 1
nothing?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Why,, 1
what, 1
good, 1
would, 1
it, 1
do?", 1
asked, 1
Caderousse., 1
"If, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
lad, 1
were, 1
living,, 1
and, 1
came, 1
to, 1
me, 1
and, 1
begged, 1
that, 1
I, 1
would, 1
candidly, 1
tell, 1
which, 1
were, 1
his, 1
true, 1
and, 1
which, 1
his, 1
false, 1
friends,, 1
why,, 1
perhaps,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
hesitate., 1
But, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
he, 1
is, 1
no, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
can, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
hatred, 1
or, 1
revenge,, 1
so, 1
let, 1
all, 1
such, 1
feeling, 1
be, 1
buried, 1
with, 1
him.", 1
"You, 1
prefer,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
bestow, 1
on, 1
men, 1
you, 1
say, 1
are, 1
false, 1
and, 1
treacherous,, 1
the, 1
reward, 1
intended, 1
for, 1
faithful, 1
friendship?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
true, 1
enough,", 1
returned, 1
Caderousse., 1
"You, 1
say, 1
truly,, 1
the, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Edmond, 1
was, 1
not, 1
meant, 1
for, 1
such, 1
traitors, 1
as, 1
Fernand, 1
and, 1
Danglars;, 1
besides,, 1
what, 1
would, 1
it, 1
be, 1
to, 1
them?, 1
no, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
drop, 1
of, 1
water, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ocean.", 1
"Remember,", 1
chimed, 1
in, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
"those, 1
two, 1
could, 1
crush, 1
you, 1
at, 1
a, 1
single, 1
blow!", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Are, 1
these, 1
persons,, 1
then,, 1
so, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
powerful?", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
know, 1
their, 1
history?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not., 1
Pray, 1
relate, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me!", 1
Caderousse, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments,, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
"No,, 1
truly,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
take, 1
up, 1
too, 1
much, 1
time.", 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
friend,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
indicated, 1
utter, 1
indifference, 1
on, 1
his, 1
part,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
at, 1
liberty,, 1
either, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
or, 1
be, 1
silent,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
for, 1
my, 1
own, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
respect, 1
your, 1
scruples, 1
and, 1
admire, 1
your, 1
sentiments;, 1
so, 1
let, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
end., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
do, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
as, 1
conscientiously, 1
as, 1
I, 1
can,, 1
and, 1
fulfil, 1
my, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man., 1
My, 1
first, 1
business, 1
will, 1
be, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
this, 1
diamond.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
again, 1
draw, 1
the, 1
small, 1
box, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
contrived, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
it, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
light,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
brilliant, 1
hues, 1
passed, 1
before, 1
the, 1
dazzled, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Wife,, 1
wife!", 1
cried, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice,, 1
"come, 1
here!", 1
"Diamond!", 1
exclaimed, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
rising, 1
and, 1
descending, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
firm, 1
step;, 1
"what, 1
diamond, 1
are, 1
you, 1
talking, 1
about?", 1
"Why,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
all, 1
we, 1
said?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
diamond, 1
left, 1
by, 1
poor, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sold,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
money, 1
divided, 1
between, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
Mercedes,, 1
his, 1
betrothed, 1
bride,, 1
Fernand,, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
myself., 1
The, 1
jewel, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
at, 1
least, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs.", 1
"Oh,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
jewel!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
astonished, 1
woman., 1
"The, 1
fifth, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
profits, 1
from, 1
this, 1
stone, 1
belongs, 1
to, 1
us, 1
then,, 1
does, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
Caderousse., 1
"It, 1
does,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"with, 1
the, 1
addition, 1
of, 1
an, 1
equal, 1
division, 1
of, 1
that, 1
part, 1
intended, 1
for, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
Dantes,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
divide, 1
equally, 1
with, 1
the, 1
four, 1
survivors.", 1
"And, 1
why, 1
among, 1
us, 1
four?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse., 1
"As, 1
being, 1
the, 1
friends, 1
Edmond, 1
esteemed, 1
most, 1
faithful, 1
and, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
call, 1
those, 1
friends, 1
who, 1
betray, 1
and, 1
ruin, 1
you,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
in, 1
her, 1
turn,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low,, 1
muttering, 1
voice., 1
"Of, 1
course, 1
not!", 1
rejoined, 1
Caderousse, 1
quickly;, 1
"no, 1
more, 1
do, 1
I,, 1

that, 1
was, 1
what, 1
I, 1
was, 1
observing, 1
to, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
just, 1
now., 1
I, 1
said, 1
I, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sacrilegious, 1
profanation, 1
to, 1
reward, 1
treachery,, 1
perhaps, 1
crime.", 1
"Remember,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
calmly,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
jewel, 1
and, 1
its, 1
case, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pocket, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cassock,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
your, 1
fault,, 1
not, 1
mine,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
do, 1
so., 1
You, 1
will, 1
have, 1
the, 1
goodness, 1
to, 1
furnish, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
address, 1
of, 1
both, 1
Fernand, 1
and, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
execute, 1
Edmond's, 1
last, 1
wishes.", 1
The, 1
agitation, 1
of, 1
Caderousse, 1
became, 1
extreme,, 1
and, 1
large, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
perspiration, 1
rolled, 1
from, 1
his, 1
heated, 1
brow., 1
As, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
rise, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
and, 1
go, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
if, 1
his, 1
horse, 1
were, 1
sufficiently, 1
refreshed, 1
to, 1
continue, 1
his, 1
journey,, 1
Caderousse, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
exchanged, 1
looks, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
meaning., 1
"There,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
wife,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
former,, 1
"this, 1
splendid, 1
diamond, 1
might, 1
all, 1
be, 1
ours,, 1
if, 1
we, 1
chose!", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
it?", 1
"Why,, 1
surely, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
his, 1
holy, 1
profession, 1
would, 1
not, 1
deceive, 1
us!", 1
"Well,", 1
replied, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
"do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
like., 1
For, 1
my, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
wash, 1
my, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
affair.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
she, 1
once, 1
more, 1
climbed, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
her, 1
chamber,, 1
her, 1
body, 1
convulsed, 1
with, 1
chills,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
teeth, 1
rattling, 1
in, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
intense, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
weather., 1
Arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
stair,, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
called, 1
out,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
warning, 1
tone,, 1
to, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
"Gaspard,, 1
consider, 1
well, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1

"I, 1
have, 1
both, 1
reflected, 1
and, 1
decided,", 1
answered, 1
he., 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
then, 1
entered, 1
her, 1
chamber,, 1
the, 1
flooring, 1
of, 1
which, 1
creaked, 1
beneath, 1
her, 1
heavy,, 1
uncertain, 1
tread,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
proceeded, 1
towards, 1
her, 1
arm-chair,, 1
into, 1
which, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
as, 1
though, 1
exhausted., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
below,, 1
"what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
made, 1
up, 1
your, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
"To, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
all, 1
I, 1
know,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
reply., 1
"I, 1
certainly, 1
think, 1
you, 1
act, 1
wisely, 1
in, 1
so, 1
doing,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"Not, 1
because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
least, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
anything, 1
you, 1
may, 1
please, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
from, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
simply, 1
that, 1
if,, 1
through, 1
your, 1
assistance,, 1
I, 1
could, 1
distribute, 1
the, 1
legacy, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
testator,, 1
why,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
his, 1
face, 1
flushed, 1
with, 1
cupidity., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
all, 1
attention,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Stop, 1
a, 1
minute,", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"we, 1
might, 1
be, 1
interrupted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
interesting, 1
part, 1
of, 1
my, 1
story,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
pity;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
as, 1
well, 1
that, 1
your, 1
visit, 1
hither, 1
should, 1
be, 1
made, 1
known, 1
only, 1
to, 1
ourselves.", 1
With, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
went, 1
stealthily, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
closed,, 1
and,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
still, 1
greater, 1
precaution,, 1
bolted, 1
and, 1
barred, 1
it,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
do, 1
at, 1
night., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
chosen, 1
his, 1
place, 1
for, 1
listening, 1
at, 1
his, 1
ease., 1
He, 1
removed, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
into, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
would, 1
be, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
shadow,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
light, 1
would, 1
be, 1
fully, 1
thrown, 1
on, 1
the, 1
narrator;, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
head, 1
bent, 1
down, 1
and, 1
hands, 1
clasped,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
clinched, 1
together,, 1
he, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
give, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
little, 1
stool,, 1
exactly, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"Remember,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
no, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
mine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
trembling, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
through, 1
the, 1
flooring, 1
of, 1
her, 1
chamber, 1
she, 1
viewed, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
that, 1
was, 1
enacting, 1
below., 1
"Enough,, 1
enough!", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"say, 1
no, 1
more, 1
about, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
all, 1
the, 1
consequences, 1
upon, 1
myself.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
began, 1
his, 1
story., 1
Chapter, 1
27., 1
The, 1
Story., 1
"First,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"you, 1
must, 1
make, 1
me, 1
a, 1
promise.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Why,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
the, 1
details, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
never, 1
let, 1
any, 1
one, 1
know, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
I, 1
who, 1
supplied, 1
them;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
talk, 1

rich, 1
and, 1
powerful,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
they, 1
only, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
tips, 1
of, 1
their, 1
fingers, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
break, 1
to, 1
pieces, 1
like, 1
glass.", 1
"Make, 1
yourself, 1
easy,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
priest,, 1
and, 1
confessions, 1
die, 1
in, 1
my, 1
breast., 1
Recollect,, 1
our, 1
only, 1
desire, 1
is, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
out,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fitting, 1
manner,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
our, 1
friend., 1
Speak,, 1
then,, 1
without, 1
reserve,, 1
as, 1
without, 1
hatred;, 1
tell, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
truth;, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

of, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1

besides,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
an, 1
Italian,, 1

not, 1
a, 1
Frenchman,, 1
and, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
God,, 1

not, 1

I, 1
shall, 1
shortly, 1
retire, 1
to, 1
my, 1
convent,, 1

have, 1
only, 1
quitted, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
the, 1
last, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dying, 1
man.", 1
This, 1
positive, 1
assurance, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
give, 1
Caderousse, 1
a, 1
little, 1
courage., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
under, 1
these, 1
circumstances,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"I, 1
will,, 1
I, 1
even, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
undeceive, 1
you, 1

to, 1
the, 1

unquestionable.", 1
"Begin, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
if, 1
you, 1

said, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"Edmond, 1
talked, 1
to, 1
me, 1

deal, 1
about, 1

for, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
love.", 1
"The, 1
history, 1
is, 1
a, 1
sad, 1
one,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head;, 1
"perhaps, 1
you, 1
know, 1
all, 1
the, 1
earlier, 1
part, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"Edmond, 1
related, 1
to, 1
me, 1
everything, 1

the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1

was, 1
arrested, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
cabaret, 1
close, 1
to, 1
Marseilles.", 1
"At, 1
La, 1

Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
I, 1
can, 1
see, 1
it, 1
all, 1
before, 1

"Was, 1
it, 1
not, 1
his, 1
betrothal, 1
feast?", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
and, 1
the, 1
feast, 1
that, 1
began, 1
so, 1
gayly, 1
had, 1
a, 1
very, 1
sorrowful, 1
ending;, 1
a, 1
police, 1
commissary,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
four, 1
soldiers,, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
arrested.", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
up, 1
to, 1
this, 1
point, 1
I, 1
know, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"Dantes, 1
himself, 1
only, 1
knew, 1
that, 1

concerned, 1
him,, 1

never, 1

again, 1

"Well,, 1
when, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
arrested,, 1
Monsieur, 1
Morrel, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
the, 1
particulars,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
were, 1
very, 1
sad., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
returned, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
his, 1
home,, 1
folded, 1
up, 1
his, 1
wedding, 1
suit, 1
with, 1
tears, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
paced, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
his, 1
chamber, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
day,, 1

would, 1
not, 1
go, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
at, 1
all,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
was, 1
underneath, 1
him, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
walking, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
night;, 1
and, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
sleep, 1
either,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
father, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
great, 1
uneasiness,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
step, 1
he, 1
took, 1
went, 1
to, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
as, 1
really, 1
as, 1
if, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
had, 1
pressed, 1
against, 1
my, 1
breast., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
Mercedes, 1
came, 1
to, 1
implore, 1
the, 1
protection, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
obtain, 1
it,, 1
however,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man;, 1
when, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
so, 1
miserable, 1
and, 1
heart-broken,, 1
having, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
sleepless, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
touched, 1
food, 1
since, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
day,, 1

wished, 1
him, 1
to, 1
go, 1
with, 1
her, 1
that, 1
she, 1
might, 1
take, 1
care, 1
of, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
would, 1
not, 1
consent., 1
'No,', 1
was, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
reply,, 1
'I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
this, 1
house,, 1

my, 1
poor, 1
dear, 1

me, 1
better, 1
than, 1

he, 1
gets, 1
out, 1
of, 1
prison, 1

will, 1
come, 1
and, 1
see, 1
me, 1
the, 1
first, 1
thing,, 1

what, 1
would, 1
he, 1
think, 1
if, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
here, 1
for, 1
him?', 1
I, 1
heard, 1
all, 1
this, 1
from, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
was, 1
anxious, 1
that, 1
Mercedes, 1
should, 1
persuade, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
her,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
footsteps, 1
over, 1
my, 1
head, 1
night, 1
and, 1
day, 1
did, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
repose.", 1
"But, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
go, 1
up-stairs, 1
and, 1
try, 1
to, 1
console, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
man?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"we, 1
cannot, 1
console, 1
those, 1
who, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
consoled,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these;, 1
besides,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
not, 1
why,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
dislike, 1
seeing, 1
me., 1
One, 1
night,, 1
however,, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
sobs,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
my, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
go, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
I, 1
reached, 1
his, 1
door, 1
he, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
weeping, 1
but, 1
praying., 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
now, 1
repeat, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
eloquent, 1
words, 1
and, 1
imploring, 1
language, 1
he, 1
made, 1
use, 1
of;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
more, 1
than, 1
piety,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
more, 1
than, 1
grief,, 1
and, 1
I,, 1
who, 1
am, 1
no, 1
canter,, 1
and, 1
hate, 1
the, 1
Jesuits,, 1
said, 1
then, 1
to, 1
myself,, 1
'It, 1
is, 1
really, 1
well,, 1

I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
glad, 1
that, 1

not, 1
any, 1
children;, 1

I, 1
were, 1
a, 1
father, 1

felt, 1
such, 1
excessive, 1
grief, 1

the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
does,, 1

did, 1
not, 1
find, 1
in, 1
my, 1
memory, 1

heart, 1

is, 1

throw, 1
myself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
at, 1
once,, 1

could, 1
not, 1

it.'", 1
"Poor, 1
father!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"From, 1
day, 1
to, 1
day, 1
he, 1
lived, 1
on, 1
alone,, 1

more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
solitary., 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1

Mercedes, 1
came, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him,, 1

his, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed;, 1
and,, 1
although, 1
I, 1
was, 1
certain, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
home,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
make, 1
any, 1
answer., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
when,, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
his, 1
custom,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
admitted, 1
Mercedes,, 1

the, 1
poor, 1
girl,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
her, 1
own, 1
grief, 1
and, 1
despair,, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
console, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
her,--'Be, 1
assured,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
daughter,, 1

is, 1
dead;, 1

instead, 1
of, 1

him,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
he, 1
who, 1
is, 1
awaiting, 1
us;, 1

am, 1
quite, 1
happy,, 1

I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
oldest,, 1

shall, 1
see, 1

However, 1
well, 1
disposed, 1

off, 1

time, 1

are, 1
in, 1
sorrow,, 1

one, 1
melancholy;, 1

so, 1
at, 1

was, 1
left, 1
all, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1

I, 1
only, 1
saw, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
strangers, 1
go, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him, 1
and, 1
come, 1
down, 1
again, 1
with, 1
some, 1
bundle, 1
they, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
hide;, 1

I, 1
guessed, 1
what, 1
these, 1
bundles, 1
were,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
sold, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
his, 1
subsistence., 1
At, 1
length, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
fellow, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
all, 1
he, 1
had;, 1
he, 1
owed, 1
three, 1
quarters', 1
rent,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
threatened, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
him, 1
out;, 1
he, 1
begged, 1
for, 1
another, 1
week,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
granted, 1
to, 1
him., 1
I, 1
know, 1
this,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
landlord, 1
came, 1
into, 1
my, 1
apartment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his., 1
For, 1
the, 1
first, 1
three, 1
days, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
walking, 1
about, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
but,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
nothing., 1
I, 1
then, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
go, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him, 1
at, 1
all, 1
risks., 1
The, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
looked, 1
through, 1
the, 1
keyhole,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
haggard,, 1
that, 1
believing, 1
him, 1
very, 1
ill,, 1
I, 1
went, 1
and, 1
told, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
and, 1
then, 1
ran, 1
on, 1
to, 1
Mercedes., 1
They, 1
both, 1
came, 1
immediately,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
bringing, 1
a, 1
doctor,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
said, 1
it, 1
was, 1
inflammation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bowels,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
a, 1
limited, 1
diet., 1
I, 1
was, 1
there,, 1
too,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
never, 1
shall, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
smile, 1
at, 1
this, 1
prescription., 1
From, 1
that, 1
time, 1
he, 1
received, 1
all, 1
who, 1
came;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
for, 1
not, 1
eating, 1
any, 1
more;, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
had, 1
put, 1
him, 1
on, 1
a, 1
diet.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
groan., 1
"The, 1
story, 1
interests, 1
you,, 1
does, 1
it, 1
not,, 1
sir?", 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
affecting.", 1
"Mercedes, 1
came, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
found, 1
him, 1
so, 1
altered, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
even, 1
more, 1
anxious, 1
than, 1
before, 1
to, 1
have, 1
him, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
her, 1
own, 1
home., 1
This, 1
was, 1
M., 1
Morrel's, 1
wish, 1
also,, 1
who, 1
would, 1
fain, 1
have, 1
conveyed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
against, 1
his, 1
consent;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
resisted,, 1
and, 1
cried, 1
so, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
actually, 1
frightened., 1
Mercedes, 1
remained,, 1
therefore,, 1
by, 1
his, 1
bedside,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
his, 1
purse, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece., 1
But, 1
availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor's, 1
order,, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
would, 1
not, 1
take, 1
any, 1
sustenance;, 1
at, 1
length, 1
(after, 1
nine, 1
days, 1
of, 1
despair, 1
and, 1
fasting),, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
died,, 1
cursing, 1
those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
his, 1
misery,, 1
and, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
Mercedes,, 1
'If, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
see, 1
my, 1
Edmond, 1
again,, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
I, 1
die, 1
blessing, 1
him.'", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
rose, 1
from, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
made, 1
two, 1
turns, 1
round, 1
the, 1
chamber,, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
trembling, 1
hand, 1
against, 1
his, 1
parched, 1
throat., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
he, 1
died"--, 1
"Of, 1
hunger,, 1
sir,, 1
of, 1
hunger,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
as, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
it, 1
as, 1
that, 1
we, 1
two, 1
are, 1
Christians.", 1
The, 1
abbe,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
shaking, 1
hand,, 1
seized, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
water, 1
that, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
by, 1
him, 1
half-full,, 1
swallowed, 1
it, 1
at, 1
one, 1
gulp,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
with, 1
red, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
pale, 1
cheeks., 1
"This, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
horrid, 1
event.", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice., 1
"The, 1
more, 1
so,, 1
sir,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
men's, 1
and, 1
not, 1
God's, 1
doing.", 1
"Tell, 1
me, 1
of, 1
those, 1
men,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"and, 1
remember, 1
too,", 1
he, 1
added, 1
in, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
menacing, 1
tone,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
everything., 1
Tell, 1
me,, 1
therefore,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
these, 1
men, 1
who, 1
killed, 1
the, 1
son, 1
with, 1
despair,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
father, 1
with, 1
famine?", 1
"Two, 1
men, 1
jealous, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
sir;, 1
one, 1
from, 1
love,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
from, 1
ambition,--Fernand, 1
and, 1
Danglars.", 1
"How, 1
was, 1
this, 1
jealousy, 1
manifested?, 1
Speak, 1
on.", 1
"They, 1
denounced, 1
Edmond, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist, 1
agent.", 1
"Which, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
denounced, 1
him?, 1
Which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
real, 1
delinquent?", 1
"Both,, 1
sir;, 1
one, 1
with, 1
a, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
put, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
post.", 1
"And, 1
where, 1
was, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
written?", 1
"At, 1
La, 1
Reserve,, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before, 1
the, 1
betrothal, 1
feast.", 1
"'Twas, 1
so,, 1
then--'twas, 1
so,, 1
then,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Oh,, 1
Faria,, 1
Faria,, 1
how, 1
well, 1
did, 1
you, 1
judge, 1
men, 1
and, 1
things!", 1
"What, 1
did, 1
you, 1
please, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Nothing,, 1
nothing,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
priest;, 1
"go, 1
on.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
Danglars, 1
who, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
denunciation, 1
with, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand,, 1
that, 1
his, 1
writing, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
recognized,, 1
and, 1
Fernand, 1
who, 1
put, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
post.", 1
"But,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
suddenly,, 1
"you, 1
were, 1
there, 1
yourself.", 1
"I!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
astonished;, 1
"who, 1
told, 1
you, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there?", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
saw, 1
he, 1
had, 1
overshot, 1
the, 1
mark,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
added, 1
quickly,--"No, 1
one;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
have, 1
known, 1
everything, 1
so, 1
well,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
an, 1
eye-witness.", 1
"True,, 1
true!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
in, 1
a, 1
choking, 1
voice,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
there.", 1
"And, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
remonstrate, 1
against, 1
such, 1
infamy?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"if, 1
not,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
an, 1
accomplice.", 1
"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"they, 1
had, 1
made, 1
me, 1
drink, 1
to, 1
such, 1
an, 1
excess, 1
that, 1
I, 1
nearly, 1
lost, 1
all, 1
perception., 1
I, 1
had, 1
only, 1
an, 1
indistinct, 1
understanding, 1
of, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
around, 1
me., 1
I, 1
said, 1
all, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
state, 1
could, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
both, 1
assured, 1
me, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
jest, 1
they, 1
were, 1
carrying, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
perfectly, 1
harmless.", 1
"Next, 1
day--next, 1
day,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
plain, 1
enough, 1
what, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
doing,, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1
though, 1
you, 1
were, 1
present, 1
when, 1
Dantes, 1
was, 1
arrested.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
very, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
speak;, 1
but, 1
Danglars, 1
restrained, 1
me., 1
'If, 1
he, 1
should, 1
really, 1
be, 1
guilty,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'and, 1
did, 1
really, 1
put, 1
in, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Island, 1

pass, 1
for, 1
his, 1
accomplices.', 1
I, 1
confess, 1
I, 1
had, 1
my, 1
fears,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
state, 1
in, 1
which, 1
politics, 1
then, 1
were,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
held, 1
my, 1
tongue., 1
It, 1
was, 1
cowardly,, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
criminal.", 1
"I, 1
understand--you, 1
allowed, 1
matters, 1
to, 1
take, 1
their, 1
course,, 1
that, 1
was, 1
all.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
answered, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"and, 1
remorse, 1
preys, 1
on, 1
me, 1
night, 1
and, 1
day., 1
I, 1
often, 1
ask, 1
pardon, 1
of, 1
God,, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
because, 1
this, 1
action,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seriously, 1
to, 1
reproach, 1
myself, 1
in, 1
all, 1
my, 1
life,, 1
is, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
abject, 1
condition., 1
I, 1
am, 1
expiating, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
selfishness,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
I, 1
always, 1
say, 1
to, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
when, 1
she, 1
complains,, 1
'Hold, 1
your, 1
tongue,, 1
woman;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
God.'", 1
And, 1
Caderousse, 1
bowed, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
every, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
real, 1
repentance., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
spoken, 1
unreservedly;, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
accuse, 1
yourself, 1
is, 1
to, 1
deserve, 1
pardon.", 1
"Unfortunately,, 1
Edmond, 1
is, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
not, 1
pardoned, 1
me.", 1
"He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"But, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
it, 1
all, 1
now,", 1
interrupted, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"they, 1
say, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
know, 1
everything.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
silence;, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
paced, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
pensively,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
seat., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times, 1
mentioned, 1
a, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"who, 1
was, 1
he?", 1
"The, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
and, 1
patron, 1
of, 1
Dantes.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
part, 1
did, 1
he, 1
play, 1
in, 1
this, 1
sad, 1
drama?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"The, 1
part, 1
of, 1
an, 1
honest, 1
man,, 1
full, 1
of, 1
courage, 1
and, 1
real, 1
regard., 1
Twenty, 1
times, 1
he, 1
interceded, 1
for, 1
Edmond., 1
When, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
returned,, 1
he, 1
wrote,, 1
implored,, 1
threatened,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
energetically,, 1
that, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
restoration, 1
he, 1
was, 1
persecuted, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist., 1
Ten, 1
times,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Dantes', 1
father,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
house;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
night, 1
or, 1
two, 1
before, 1
his, 1
death,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
said,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his, 1
purse, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mantelpiece,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
they, 1
paid, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
debts,, 1
and, 1
buried, 1
him, 1
decently;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
Edmond's, 1
father, 1
died,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lived,, 1
without, 1
doing, 1
harm, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one., 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
purse, 1
still, 1
by, 1
me--a, 1
large, 1
one,, 1
made, 1
of, 1
red, 1
silk.", 1
"And,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"is, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
still, 1
alive?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse., 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
rich,, 1
happy.", 1
Caderousse, 1
smiled, 1
bitterly., 1
"Yes,, 1
happy, 1
as, 1
myself,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"What!, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
unhappy?", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
reduced, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
extremity--nay,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
at, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
dishonor.", 1
"How?", 1
"Yes,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"so, 1
it, 1
is;, 1
after, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
labor,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
acquired, 1
a, 1
most, 1
honorable, 1
name, 1
in, 1
the, 1
trade, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
is, 1
utterly, 1
ruined;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
lost, 1
five, 1
ships, 1
in, 1
two, 1
years,, 1
has, 1
suffered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bankruptcy, 1
of, 1
three, 1
large, 1
houses,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
only, 1
hope, 1
now, 1
is, 1
in, 1
that, 1
very, 1
Pharaon, 1
which, 1
poor, 1
Dantes, 1
commanded,, 1

which, 1

The, 1

Some, 1

The, 1
abbe, 1
opened, 1

for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
then,, 1

an, 1
effort, 1
at, 1

he, 1
said,, 1
"And, 1
Mercedes--they, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1

"Disappeared,", 1

Caderousse,, 1

Caderousse., 1
"Go, 1

less, 1

"Mercedes, 1
was, 1
at, 1
first, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
despair, 1
at, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
which, 1
deprived, 1
her, 1
of, 1

her, 1

In, 1
the, 1

of, 1
her, 1

a, 1
new, 1
affliction, 1
overtook, 1
her., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
departure, 1
of, 1
Fernand--of, 1
Fernand,, 1
whose, 1
crime, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
regarded, 1
as, 1
her, 1
brother., 1
Fernand, 1
went,, 1
and, 1
Mercedes, 1
remained, 1
alone., 1
Three, 1
months, 1
passed, 1
and, 1
still, 1
she, 1
wept--no, 1
news, 1
of, 1
Edmond,, 1
no, 1
news, 1
of, 1
Fernand,, 1
no, 1
companionship, 1
save, 1
that, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
dying, 1
with, 1
despair., 1
One, 1
evening,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
day, 1
of, 1
accustomed, 1
vigil, 1
at, 1
the, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
two, 1
roads, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
Marseilles, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
she, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
her, 1
home, 1
more, 1
depressed, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
Suddenly, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
step, 1
she, 1
knew,, 1
turned, 1
anxiously, 1
around,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Fernand,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
uniform, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sub-lieutenant,, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
her., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
one, 1
she, 1
wished, 1
for, 1
most,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
her, 1
past, 1
life, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
her., 1
Mercedes, 1
seized, 1
Fernand's, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
a, 1
transport, 1
which, 1
he, 1
took, 1
for, 1
love,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
was, 1
only, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
being, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
at, 1
last, 1
a, 1
friend,, 1
after, 1
long, 1
hours, 1
of, 1
solitary, 1
sorrow., 1
And, 1
then,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
confessed,, 1
Fernand, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
hated--he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
not, 1
precisely, 1
loved., 1
Another, 1
possessed, 1
all, 1
Mercedes', 1
heart;, 1
that, 1
other, 1
was, 1
absent,, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
perhaps, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
At, 1
this, 1
last, 1
thought, 1
Mercedes, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
flood, 1
of, 1
tears,, 1
and, 1
wrung, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
in, 1
agony;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
thought,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
always, 1
repelled, 1
before, 1
when, 1
it, 1
was, 1
suggested, 1
to, 1
her, 1
by, 1
another,, 1
came, 1
now, 1
in, 1
full, 1
force, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
mind;, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
too,, 1
old, 1
Dantes, 1
incessantly, 1
said, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
'Our, 1
Edmond, 1
is, 1
dead;, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
not,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
return, 1
to, 1
us.', 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
died,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you;, 1
had, 1
he, 1
lived,, 1
Mercedes,, 1
perchance,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
become, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
of, 1
another,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
there, 1
to, 1
reproach, 1
her, 1
infidelity., 1
Fernand, 1
saw, 1
this,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
learned, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
death, 1
he, 1
returned., 1
He, 1
was, 1
now, 1
a, 1
lieutenant., 1
At, 1
his, 1
first, 1
coming, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
said, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
love, 1
to, 1
Mercedes;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
second, 1
he, 1
reminded, 1
her, 1
that, 1
he, 1
loved, 1
her., 1
Mercedes, 1
begged, 1
for, 1
six, 1
months, 1
more, 1
in, 1
which, 1
to, 1
await, 1
and, 1
mourn, 1
for, 1
Edmond.", 1
"So, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
smile,, 1
"that, 1
makes, 1
eighteen, 1
months, 1
in, 1
all., 1
What, 1
more, 1
could, 1
the, 1
most, 1
devoted, 1
lover, 1
desire?", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English, 1
poet,, 1
"'Frailty,, 1
thy, 1
name, 1
is, 1
woman.'", 1
"Six, 1
months, 1
afterwards,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"the, 1
marriage, 1
took, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
church, 1
of, 1
Accoules.", 1
"The, 1
very, 1
church, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
was, 1
to, 1
have, 1
married, 1
Edmond,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
priest;, 1
"there, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
change, 1
of, 1
bride-grooms.", 1
"Well,, 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
married,", 1
proceeded, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"but, 1
although, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
calm,, 1
she, 1
nearly, 1
fainted, 1
as, 1
she, 1
passed, 1
La, 1
Reserve,, 1
where,, 1
eighteen, 1
months, 1
before,, 1
the, 1
betrothal, 1
had, 1
been, 1
celebrated, 1
with, 1
him, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
might, 1
have, 1
known, 1
she, 1
still, 1
loved, 1
had, 1
she, 1
looked, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
her, 1
heart., 1
Fernand,, 1
more, 1
happy,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
more, 1
at, 1
his, 1
ease--for, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
at, 1
this, 1
time, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
dread, 1
of, 1
Edmond's, 1
return--Fernand, 1
was, 1
very, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
get, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
depart, 1
himself., 1
There, 1
were, 1
too, 1
many, 1
unpleasant, 1
possibilities, 1
associated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
and, 1
eight, 1
days, 1
after, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
they, 1
left, 1
Marseilles.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
see, 1
Mercedes, 1
again?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"Yes,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
war,, 1
at, 1
Perpignan,, 1
where, 1
Fernand, 1
had, 1
left, 1
her;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
attending, 1
to, 1
the, 1
education, 1
of, 1
her, 1
son.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
started., 1
"Her, 1
son?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"little, 1
Albert.", 1
"But,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
instruct, 1
her, 1
child,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
"she, 1
must, 1
have, 1
received, 1
an, 1
education, 1
herself., 1
I, 1
understood, 1
from, 1
Edmond, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
fisherman,, 1
beautiful, 1
but, 1
uneducated.", 1
"Oh,", 1
replied, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"did, 1
he, 1
know, 1
so, 1
little, 1
of, 1
his, 1
lovely, 1
betrothed?, 1
Mercedes, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
queen,, 1
sir,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
crown, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
heads, 1
of, 1
the, 1
loveliest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
intelligent., 1
Fernand's, 1
fortune, 1
was, 1
already, 1
waxing, 1
great,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
developed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
growing, 1
fortune., 1
She, 1
learned, 1
drawing,, 1
music--everything., 1
Besides,, 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
between, 1
ourselves,, 1
she, 1
did, 1
this, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
distract, 1
her, 1
mind,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
might, 1

she, 1
only, 1
filled, 1

alleviate, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
on, 1
her, 1

But, 1
now, 1
her, 1
position, 1
in, 1
life, 1
is, 1
assured,", 1
continued, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"no, 1
doubt, 1
fortune, 1
and, 1
honors, 1
have, 1
comforted, 1
her;, 1
she, 1
is, 1
rich,, 1
a, 1
countess,, 1
and, 1
yet"--Caderousse, 1
paused., 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
what?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Yet,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure,, 1
she, 1
is, 1
not, 1
happy,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"What, 1
makes, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
this?", 1
"Why,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
found, 1
myself, 1
utterly, 1
destitute,, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
my, 1
old, 1
friends, 1
would,, 1
perhaps,, 1
assist, 1
me., 1
So, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
would, 1
not, 1
even, 1
receive, 1
me., 1
I, 1
called, 1
on, 1
Fernand,, 1
who, 1
sent, 1
me, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
by, 1
his, 1
valet-de-chambre.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
either, 1
of, 1
them?", 1
"No,, 1
but, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
saw, 1
me.", 1
"How, 1
was, 1
that?", 1
"As, 1
I, 1
went, 1
away, 1
a, 1
purse, 1
fell, 1
at, 1
my, 1
feet--it, 1
contained, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
louis;, 1
I, 1
raised, 1
my, 1
head, 1
quickly,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Mercedes,, 1
who, 1
at, 1
once, 1
shut, 1
the, 1
blind.", 1
"And, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Oh,, 1
he, 1
never, 1
was, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine,, 1

did, 1
not, 1

of, 1
him.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1

what, 1
became, 1
of, 1
him,, 1

the, 1

he, 1
had, 1
in, 1
Edmond's, 1
misfortunes?", 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
only, 1
know, 1
that, 1
some, 1
time, 1
after, 1
Edmond's, 1
arrest,, 1
he, 1
married, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
after, 1
left, 1
Marseilles;, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1

has, 1
been, 1
as, 1
lucky, 1
as, 1
the, 1
rest;, 1
no, 1

is, 1
as, 1
rich, 1
as, 1
Danglars,, 1
as, 1
high, 1
in, 1
station, 1
as, 1
Fernand., 1
I, 1
only,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
have, 1
remained, 1
poor,, 1
wretched,, 1
and, 1
forgotten.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
mistaken,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"God, 1
may, 1
seem, 1
sometimes, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
for, 1
a, 1
time,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
justice, 1
reposes,, 1

there, 1
always, 1
comes, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
remembers--and, 1
behold--a, 1
proof!", 1
As, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
took, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
giving, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Caderousse,, 1
said,--"Here,, 1
my, 1

this, 1
diamond,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
yours.", 1
"What,, 1
for, 1
me, 1
only?", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"ah,, 1
sir,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
jest, 1
with, 1
me!", 1
"This, 1
diamond, 1
was, 1

it, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
divided., 1

the, 1
diamond,, 1
then,, 1

sell, 1
it;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1

I, 1
repeat, 1
my, 1
wish, 1
that, 1
this, 1
sum, 1
may, 1
suffice, 1
to, 1
release, 1
you, 1
from, 1
your, 1
wretchedness.", 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
putting, 1
out, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
timidly,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
wiping, 1
away, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
which, 1
bedewed, 1
his, 1
brow,--"Oh,, 1

in, 1

Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1
withdrew, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
smiled., 1
"In, 1
exchange,", 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
"give, 1
me, 1
the, 1
red, 1
silk, 1

Caderousse,, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
astonished,, 1
went, 1
toward, 1
a, 1
large, 1
oaken, 1
cupboard,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
the, 1

a, 1
long, 1

of, 1
faded, 1
red, 1
silk,, 1
round, 1

The, 1
abbe, 1
took, 1
it,, 1

Caderousse, 1
the, 1
diamond., 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
God,, 1
sir,", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"for, 1
no, 1

to, 1

Caderousse,, 1
"in, 1

with, 1
difficulty, 1
got, 1
away, 1
from, 1

of, 1
Caderousse,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
himself,, 1
got, 1
out, 1
and, 1
mounted, 1
his, 1
horse,, 1
once, 1
more, 1
saluted, 1
the, 1
innkeeper,, 1

kept, 1
uttering, 1
his, 1
loud, 1
farewells,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
road, 1
he, 1
had, 1
travelled, 1
in, 1
coming., 1
When, 1
Caderousse, 1
turned, 1
around,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
behind, 1
him, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
paler, 1
and, 1
trembling, 1
more, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
"Is,, 1
then,, 1
all, 1
that, 1
I, 1

inquired., 1
"What?, 1

has, 1

the, 1
diamond, 1
to, 1
us, 1

with, 1
joy;, 1
"yes,, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
true!, 1

here, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
The, 1
woman, 1
gazed, 1
at, 1
it, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
voice,, 1
"Suppose, 1
it's, 1
false?", 1
Caderousse, 1
started, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
pale., 1
"False!", 1
he, 1
muttered., 1
"False!, 1
Why, 1
should, 1
that, 1
man, 1
give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
false, 1
diamond?", 1
"To, 1

your, 1
secret, 1
without, 1
paying, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
you, 1
blockhead!", 1
Caderousse, 1
remained, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
aghast, 1
under, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
such, 1
an, 1
idea., 1
"Oh!", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
which, 1
he, 1

know, 1
very, 1

what, 1
is, 1

opinion, 1

find, 1

better, 1
informed, 1
than, 1

The, 1
Englishman, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
appreciate, 1
this, 1
extreme, 1
delicacy,, 1
made, 1
his, 1
bow, 1
and, 1
went, 1
away,, 1

characteristic, 1
British, 1
stride, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
street, 1

M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
private, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
on, 1
perceiving, 1
him,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
surprise,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
indicate, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
his, 1
presence., 1
As, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
state, 1
of, 1
despair,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
all, 1
the, 1
faculties, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
thought, 1
which, 1
occupied, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
either, 1
his, 1
memory, 1
or, 1
his, 1
imagination, 1
to, 1
stray, 1
to, 1
the, 1
past., 1
The, 1
Englishman,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
coolness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
nation,, 1
addressed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
terms, 1
nearly, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
those, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
accosted, 1
the, 1
mayor, 1
of, 1
Marseilles., 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
"your, 1
fears, 1
are, 1
unfortunately, 1
but, 1
too, 1
well, 1
founded,, 1

you, 1

before, 1
you, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
despair., 1
I, 1
had, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
placed, 1
in, 1

hands, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1

these, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1

married, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fortnight,, 1

the, 1
other, 1
half, 1

of, 1
next, 1
month., 1

had, 1
informed, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
of, 1
my, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
have, 1
these, 1
payments, 1
punctually,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
here, 1
within, 1
the, 1
last, 1
half-hour, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1
if, 1
his, 1
ship,, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
into, 1
port, 1
on, 1
the, 1
15th,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
wholly, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
make, 1
this, 1
payment.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
"this, 1
looks, 1
very, 1
much, 1
like, 1
a, 1
suspension, 1
of, 1
payment.", 1
"It, 1
looks, 1
more, 1
like, 1
bankruptcy!", 1
exclaimed, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
despairingly., 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
said,--"From, 1
which, 1
it, 1
would, 1
appear,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
this, 1
credit, 1
inspires, 1
you, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
apprehension?", 1
"To, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
it, 1
lost.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
buy, 1
it, 1
of, 1
you!", 1
"You?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I!", 1
"But, 1
at, 1
a, 1
tremendous, 1
discount,, 1
of, 1
course?", 1
"No,, 1
for, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs., 1
Our, 1
house,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
with, 1
a, 1
laugh,, 1
"does, 1
not, 1
do, 1
things, 1
in, 1
that, 1
way.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
will, 1
pay"--, 1
"Ready, 1
money.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
bundle, 1
of, 1
bank-notes,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
twice, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
lose., 1
A, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
passed, 1
across, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville's, 1
countenance,, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
made, 1
an, 1
effort, 1
at, 1
self-control,, 1
and, 1
said,--"Sir,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
realize, 1
six, 1
per, 1
cent, 1
of, 1
this, 1
sum.", 1
"That's, 1
no, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
mine,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1

in, 1
whose, 1
name, 1

have,, 1
perhaps,, 1
some, 1
motive, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
in, 1
hastening, 1
the, 1
ruin, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rival, 1
firm., 1
But, 1
all, 1
I, 1
know,, 1

is,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
hand, 1
you, 1
over, 1

sum, 1
in, 1

for, 1
your, 1
assignment, 1
of, 1

only, 1
ask, 1
a, 1
brokerage.", 1
"Of, 1
course,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
perfectly, 1
just,", 1
cried, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville., 1
"The, 1
commission, 1
is, 1
usually, 1
one, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half;, 1
will, 1
you, 1
have, 1
two--three--five, 1
per, 1
cent,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
more?, 1
Whatever, 1
you, 1
say.", 1
"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
laughing,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
like, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
do, 1
such, 1
things--no,, 1
the, 1
commission, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
different.", 1
"Name, 1
it,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
beg.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
these, 1
fourteen, 1
years.", 1
"You, 1
keep, 1
the, 1
registers, 1
of, 1
entries, 1
and, 1
departures?", 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"To, 1
these, 1
registers, 1
there, 1
are, 1
added, 1
notes, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoners?", 1
"There, 1
are, 1
special, 1
reports, 1
on, 1
every, 1
prisoner.", 1
"Well,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
educated, 1
at, 1
home, 1
by, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
devil, 1
of, 1
an, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
disappeared, 1
suddenly., 1
I, 1
have, 1
since, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
confined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
some, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
his, 1
death.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"The, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
recollect, 1
him, 1
perfectly,", 1
cried, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville;, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
crazy.", 1
"So, 1
they, 1
said.", 1
"Oh,, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
decidedly.", 1
"Very, 1
possibly;, 1
but, 1
what, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
madness, 1
was, 1
it?", 1
"He, 1
pretended, 1
to, 1
know, 1
of, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
treasure,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
vast, 1
sums, 1
to, 1
the, 1
government, 1
if, 1
they, 1
would, 1
liberate, 1
him.", 1
"Poor, 1
devil!--and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
dead?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
months, 1
ago--last, 1
February.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
a, 1
good, 1
memory,, 1
sir,, 1
to, 1
recollect, 1
dates, 1
so, 1
well.", 1
"I, 1
recollect, 1
this,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
devil's, 1
death, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
incident.", 1
"May, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
what, 1
that, 1
was?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
curiosity,, 1
which, 1
a, 1
close, 1
observer, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
astonished, 1
at, 1
discovering, 1
in, 1
his, 1
phlegmatic, 1
countenance., 1
"Oh, 1
dear,, 1
yes,, 1
sir;, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
dungeon, 1
was, 1
forty, 1
or, 1
fifty, 1
feet, 1
distant, 1
from, 1
that, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Bonaparte's, 1
emissaries,--one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
contributed, 1
the, 1
most, 1
to, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
the, 1
usurper, 1
in, 1
1815,--a, 1
very, 1
resolute, 1
and, 1
very, 1
dangerous, 1
man.", 1
"Indeed!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville;, 1
"I, 1
myself, 1
had, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
see, 1
this, 1
man, 1
in, 1
1816, 1
or, 1
1817,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
could, 1
only, 1
go, 1
into, 1
his, 1
dungeon, 1
with, 1
a, 1
file, 1
of, 1
soldiers., 1
That, 1
man, 1
made, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
forget, 1
his, 1
countenance!", 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
smiled, 1
imperceptibly., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
interposed,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
dungeons"--, 1
"Were, 1
separated, 1
by, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
fifty, 1
feet;, 1

it, 1
appears, 1
that, 1
this, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes"--, 1
"This, 1
dangerous, 1
man's, 1
name, 1
was"--, 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes., 1
It, 1
appears,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
this, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
procured, 1
tools,, 1
or, 1
made, 1
them,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
found, 1
a, 1
tunnel, 1
through, 1
which, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
held, 1
communication, 1
with, 1
one, 1

"This, 1
tunnel, 1
was, 1
dug,, 1

an, 1

attack, 1
of, 1
catalepsy,, 1
and, 1
died.", 1
"That, 1
must, 1
have, 1
cut, 1
short, 1
the, 1
projects, 1
of, 1
escape.", 1
"For, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
man,, 1
yes,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
"but, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
survivor;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
this, 1
Dantes, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
accelerating, 1
his, 1
escape., 1
He,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
prisoners, 1
who, 1
died, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
were, 1
interred, 1
in, 1
an, 1
ordinary, 1
burial-ground,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
conveyed, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
man, 1
into, 1
his, 1
own, 1
cell,, 1
took, 1
his, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sack, 1
in, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
sewed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
and, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
interment.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
bold, 1
step,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
that, 1
showed, 1
some, 1
courage,", 1
remarked, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"As, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
dangerous, 1
man;, 1
and,, 1
fortunately,, 1
by, 1
his, 1
own, 1
act, 1
disembarrassed, 1
the, 1
government, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fears, 1
it, 1
had, 1
on, 1
his, 1
account.", 1
"How, 1
was, 1
that?", 1
"How?, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
comprehend?", 1
"No.", 1
"The, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
has, 1
no, 1
cemetery,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
simply, 1
throw, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
after, 1
fastening, 1
a, 1
thirty-six, 1
pound, 1
cannon-ball, 1
to, 1
their, 1
feet.", 1
"Well,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
slow, 1
of, 1
comprehension., 1
"Well,, 1
they, 1
fastened, 1
a, 1
thirty-six, 1
pound, 1
ball, 1
to, 1
his, 1
feet,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea.", 1
"Really!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons., 1
"You, 1
may, 1
imagine, 1
the, 1
amazement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fugitive, 1
when, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
flung, 1
headlong, 1
over, 1
the, 1
rocks!, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
face, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment.", 1
"That, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
difficult.", 1
"No, 1
matter,", 1
replied, 1
De, 1
Boville,, 1
in, 1
supreme, 1
good-humor, 1
at, 1
the, 1
certainty, 1
of, 1
recovering, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs,--"no, 1
matter,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
fancy, 1
it.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
shouted, 1
with, 1
laughter., 1
"So, 1
can, 1
I,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
laughed, 1
too;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
laughed, 1
as, 1
the, 1
English, 1
do,, 1
"at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
his, 1
teeth.", 1
"And, 1
so,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
who, 1
first, 1
gained, 1
his, 1
composure,, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
drowned?", 1
"Unquestionably.", 1
"So, 1
that, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
got, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dangerous, 1
and, 1
the, 1
crazy, 1
prisoner, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time?", 1
"Precisely.", 1
"But, 1
some, 1
official, 1
document, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
up, 1
as, 1
to, 1
this, 1
affair,, 1
I, 1
suppose?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
the, 1
mortuary, 1
deposition., 1
You, 1
understand,, 1
Dantes', 1
relations,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
any,, 1
might, 1
have, 1
some, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
knowing, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
dead, 1
or, 1
alive.", 1
"So, 1
that, 1
now,, 1
if, 1
there, 1
were, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
inherit, 1
from, 1
him,, 1
they, 1
may, 1
do, 1
so, 1
with, 1
easy, 1
conscience., 1
He, 1
is, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
mistake, 1
about, 1
it.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
and, 1
they, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
attested, 1
whenever, 1
they, 1
please.", 1
"So, 1
be, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"But, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
these, 1
registers.", 1
"True,, 1
this, 1
story, 1
has, 1
diverted, 1
our, 1
attention, 1
from, 1
them., 1
Excuse, 1
me.", 1
"Excuse, 1
you, 1
for, 1
what?, 1
For, 1
the, 1
story?, 1
By, 1
no, 1
means;, 1
it, 1
really, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
very, 1
curious.", 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed., 1
So,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
all, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
really, 1
was, 1
gentleness, 1
itself.", 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
much, 1
oblige, 1
me.", 1
"Go, 1
into, 1
my, 1
study, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
show, 1
it, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
And, 1
they, 1
both, 1
entered, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville's, 1
study., 1
Everything, 1
was, 1
here, 1
arranged, 1
in, 1
perfect, 1
order;, 1
each, 1
register, 1
had, 1
its, 1
number,, 1
each, 1
file, 1
of, 1
papers, 1
its, 1
place., 1
The, 1
inspector, 1
begged, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
to, 1
seat, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arm-chair,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
before, 1
him, 1
the, 1
register, 1
and, 1
documents, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
giving, 1
him, 1
all, 1
the, 1
time, 1
he, 1
desired, 1
for, 1
the, 1
examination,, 1
while, 1
De, 1
Boville, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
read, 1
his, 1
newspaper., 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
easily, 1
found, 1
the, 1
entries, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
history, 1
which, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
had, 1
related, 1
interested, 1
him, 1
greatly,, 1
for, 1
after, 1
having, 1
perused, 1
the, 1
first, 1
documents, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
over, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
until, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
deposition, 1
respecting, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes., 1
There, 1
he, 1
found, 1
everything, 1
arranged, 1
in, 1
due, 1
order,--the, 1
accusation,, 1
examination,, 1
Morrel's, 1
petition,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
marginal, 1
notes., 1
He, 1
folded, 1
up, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
quietly,, 1
and, 1
put, 1
it, 1
as, 1
quietly, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket;, 1
read, 1
the, 1
examination,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mentioned, 1
in, 1
it;, 1
perused,, 1
too,, 1
the, 1
application, 1
dated, 1
10th, 1
April,, 1
1815,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Morrel,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
deputy, 1
procureur's, 1
advice,, 1
exaggerated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
best, 1
intentions, 1
(for, 1
Napoleon, 1
was, 1
then, 1
on, 1
the, 1
throne), 1
the, 1
services, 1
Dantes, 1
had, 1
rendered, 1
to, 1
the, 1
imperial, 1
cause--services, 1
which, 1
Villefort's, 1
certificates, 1
rendered, 1
indispensable., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
through, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
thing., 1
This, 1
petition, 1
to, 1
Napoleon,, 1
kept, 1
back, 1
by, 1
Villefort,, 1
had, 1
become,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
second, 1
restoration,, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
weapon, 1
against, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney., 1
He, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
astonished, 1
when, 1
he, 1
searched, 1
on, 1
to, 1
find, 1
in, 1
the, 1
register, 1
this, 1
note,, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
bracket, 1
against, 1
his, 1
name:--, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes., 1
An, 1
inveterate, 1
Bonapartist;, 1
took, 1
an, 1
active, 1
part, 1
in, 1
the, 1
return, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba., 1
To, 1
be, 1
kept, 1
in, 1
strict, 1
solitary, 1
confinement,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
be, 1
closely, 1
watched, 1
and, 1
guarded., 1
Beneath, 1
these, 1
lines, 1
was, 1
written, 1
in, 1
another, 1
hand:, 1
"See, 1
note, 1
above--nothing, 1
can, 1
be, 1
done.", 1
He, 1
compared, 1
the, 1
writing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bracket, 1
with, 1
the, 1
writing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
certificate, 1
placed, 1
beneath, 1
Morrel's, 1
petition,, 1
and, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
note, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bracket, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
writing, 1
as, 1
the, 1
certificate--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
was, 1
in, 1
Villefort's, 1
handwriting., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
note, 1
which, 1
accompanied, 1
this,, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
added, 1
by, 1
some, 1
inspector, 1
who, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
a, 1
momentary, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
Dantes', 1
situation,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
had,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
remarks, 1
we, 1
have, 1
quoted,, 1
found, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
give, 1
any, 1
effect, 1
to, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
he, 1
had, 1
felt., 1
As, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
inspector,, 1
from, 1
discretion,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
disturb, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria's, 1
pupil, 1
in, 1
his, 1
researches,, 1
had, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
reading, 1
Le, 1
Drapeau, 1
Blanc., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
fold, 1
up, 1
and, 1
place, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
written, 1
by, 1
Danglars, 1
under, 1
the, 1
arbor, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Reserve,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
the, 1
postmark,, 1
"Marseilles,, 1
27th, 1
Feb.,, 1
delivery, 1
6, 1
o'clock,, 1
P.M.", 1
But, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
said, 1
that, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
it,, 1
he, 1
attached, 1
so, 1
little, 1
importance, 1
to, 1
this, 1
scrap, 1
of, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
much, 1
importance, 1
to, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
opposed, 1
whatever, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
might, 1
do,, 1
however, 1
irregular, 1
it, 1
might, 1
be., 1
"Thanks,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
closing, 1
the, 1
register, 1
with, 1
a, 1
slam,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
all, 1
I, 1
want;, 1
now, 1
it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
perform, 1
my, 1
promise., 1
Give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
assignment, 1
of, 1
your, 1
debt;, 1
acknowledge, 1
therein, 1
the, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cash,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
hand, 1
you, 1
over, 1
the, 1
money.", 1
He, 1
rose,, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
who, 1
took, 1
it, 1
without, 1
ceremony,, 1
and, 1
quickly, 1
drew, 1
up, 1
the, 1
required, 1
assignment,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
counted, 1
out, 1
the, 1
bank-notes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1

the, 1
interior, 1
of, 1
Morrel's, 1
warehouse,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
at, 1
this, 1
date,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
found, 1
a, 1
great, 1
change., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
that, 1
air, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
of, 1
comfort,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
happiness, 1
that, 1
permeates, 1
a, 1
flourishing, 1

prosperous, 1

establishment--instead, 1
of, 1
merry, 1
faces, 1
at, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
busy, 1
clerks, 1
hurrying, 1
to, 1

bales, 1
of, 1
goods,, 1
re-echoing, 1
with, 1
the, 1
cries, 1
and, 1
the, 1
jokes, 1
of, 1
porters,, 1
one, 1
would, 1
have, 1
immediately, 1
perceived, 1
all, 1
aspect, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1

gloom., 1
Out, 1

One, 1
was, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
and, 1
twenty,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
love, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel's, 1
daughter,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
with, 1
him, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
efforts, 1
of, 1
his, 1

bee-hive,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
so, 1
completely, 1

his, 1
real, 1
name, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not,, 1

probability,, 1
have, 1
replied, 1
to, 1
any, 1

him, 1

it., 1
Cocles, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
M., 1
Morrel's, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
most, 1
singular, 1
change, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
in, 1
his, 1
position;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
at, 1

inflexible, 1
on, 1

subject, 1
of, 1
arithmetic,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
point, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
stood, 1
firm, 1
against, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
even, 1
against, 1
M., 1
Morrel;, 1
and, 1
strong, 1
in, 1
the, 1
multiplication-table,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
at, 1
his, 1
fingers', 1
ends,, 1
no, 1
matter, 1
what, 1
scheme, 1
or, 1
what, 1
trap, 1
was, 1
laid, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
him., 1
In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disasters, 1
that, 1
befell, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
Cocles, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
unmoved., 1
But, 1
this, 1
did, 1
not, 1
arise, 1
from, 1
a, 1
want, 1
of, 1
affection;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
from, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
conviction., 1
Like, 1
the, 1
rats, 1
that, 1
one, 1
by, 1
one, 1
forsake, 1
the, 1
doomed, 1
ship, 1
even, 1
before, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
weighs, 1
anchor,, 1
so, 1
all, 1
the, 1
numerous, 1
clerks, 1
had, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
deserted, 1
the, 1
office, 1
and, 1
the, 1
warehouse., 1
Cocles, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
them, 1
go, 1
without, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
inquiring, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
their, 1
departure., 1
Everything, 1
was, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
a, 1
question, 1
of, 1
arithmetic, 1
to, 1
Cocles,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
he, 1
had, 1
always, 1
seen, 1
all, 1
payments, 1
made, 1
with, 1
such, 1
exactitude,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
house, 1
should, 1
stop, 1
payment,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
would, 1
to, 1
a, 1
miller, 1
that, 1
the, 1
river, 1
that, 1
had, 1
so, 1
long, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
mill, 1
should, 1
cease, 1
to, 1
flow., 1
Nothing, 1
had, 1
as, 1
yet, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
Cocles', 1
belief;, 1
the, 1
last, 1
month's, 1
payment, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
scrupulous, 1
exactitude;, 1
Cocles, 1
had, 1
detected, 1
an, 1
overbalance, 1
of, 1
fourteen, 1
sous, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cash,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
same, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
smile,, 1
threw, 1
them, 1
into, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
empty, 1
drawer,, 1
saying:--, 1
"Thanks,, 1
Cocles;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
pearl, 1
of, 1
cashiers.", 1
Cocles, 1
went, 1
away, 1
perfectly, 1
happy,, 1
for, 1
this, 1
eulogium, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
pearl, 1
of, 1
the, 1
honest, 1
men, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
flattered, 1
him, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
present, 1
of, 1
fifty, 1
crowns., 1
But, 1
since, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
many, 1
an, 1
anxious, 1
hour., 1
In, 1
order, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
payments, 1
then, 1
due;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
collected, 1
all, 1
his, 1
resources,, 1
and,, 1
fearing, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
report, 1
of, 1
his, 1
distress, 1
should, 1
get, 1
bruited, 1
abroad, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
known, 1
to, 1
be, 1
reduced, 1
to, 1
such, 1
an, 1
extremity,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Beaucaire, 1
fair, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
and, 1
daughter's, 1
jewels, 1
and, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
plate., 1
By, 1
this, 1
means, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month, 1
was, 1
passed,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
resources, 1
were, 1
now, 1
exhausted., 1
Credit,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reports, 1
afloat,, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
to, 1
be, 1
had;, 1
and, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
due, 1
on, 1
the, 1
10th, 1
of, 1
the, 1
present, 1
month,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
due, 1
on, 1
the, 1
15th, 1
of, 1
the, 1
next, 1
month, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had,, 1
in, 1
reality,, 1
no, 1
hope, 1
but, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
of, 1
whose, 1
departure, 1
he, 1
had, 1
learnt, 1
from, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
which, 1
had, 1
weighed, 1
anchor, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
already, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
harbor., 1
But, 1
this, 1
vessel, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
came, 1
from, 1
Calcutta,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
for, 1
a, 1
fortnight,, 1
while, 1
no, 1
intelligence, 1
had, 1
been, 1
received, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon., 1
Such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
state, 1
of, 1
affairs, 1
when,, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after, 1
his, 1
interview, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
the, 1
confidential, 1
clerk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
M., 1
Morrel's., 1
Emmanuel, 1
received, 1
him;, 1
this, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
alarmed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
every, 1
new, 1
face,, 1
for, 1
every, 1
new, 1
face, 1
might, 1
be, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
new, 1
creditor,, 1
come, 1
in, 1
anxiety, 1
to, 1
question, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
spare, 1
his, 1
employer, 1
the, 1
pain, 1
of, 1
this, 1
interview,, 1
questioned, 1
the, 1
new-comer;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Emmanuel,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
his, 1
business, 1
was, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
person., 1
Emmanuel, 1
sighed,, 1
and, 1
summoned, 1
Cocles., 1
Cocles, 1
appeared,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
bade, 1
him, 1
conduct, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Morrel's, 1
apartment., 1
Cocles, 1
went, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
followed, 1
him., 1
On, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
they, 1
met, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
sixteen, 1
or, 1
seventeen,, 1
who, 1
looked, 1
with, 1
anxiety, 1
at, 1
the, 1
stranger., 1
"M., 1
Morrel, 1
is, 1
in, 1
his, 1
room,, 1
is, 1
he, 1
not,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Julie?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
cashier., 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
at, 1
least,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
hesitatingly., 1
"Go, 1
and, 1
see,, 1
Cocles,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
my, 1
father, 1
is, 1
there,, 1
announce, 1
this, 1
gentleman.", 1
"It, 1
will, 1
be, 1
useless, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
me,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"M., 1
Morrel, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know, 1
my, 1
name;, 1
this, 1
worthy, 1
gentleman, 1
has, 1
only, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
the, 1
confidential, 1
clerk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
your, 1
father, 1
does, 1
business.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
turned, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
descend,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
and, 1
Cocles, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
mount, 1
the, 1
staircase., 1
She, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
office, 1
where, 1
Emmanuel, 1
was,, 1
while, 1
Cocles,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
a, 1
key, 1
he, 1
possessed,, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
door, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
landing-place, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
staircase,, 1
conducted, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
into, 1
an, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
second, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
left, 1
the, 1
clerk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
alone,, 1
returned, 1
and, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
enter., 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
Morrel, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
formidable, 1
columns, 1
of, 1
his, 1
ledger,, 1
which, 1
contained, 1
the, 1
list, 1
of, 1
his, 1
liabilities., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
ledger,, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
to, 1
the, 1
stranger;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
seated,, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
own, 1
chair., 1
Fourteen, 1
years, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
merchant,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
thirty-sixth, 1
year, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
of, 1
this, 1
history,, 1
was, 1
now, 1
in, 1
his, 1
fiftieth;, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
white,, 1
time, 1
and, 1
sorrow, 1
had, 1
ploughed, 1
deep, 1
furrows, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
look,, 1
once, 1
so, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
penetrating,, 1
was, 1
now, 1
irresolute, 1
and, 1
wandering,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
being, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
fix, 1
his, 1
attention, 1
on, 1
some, 1
particular, 1
thought, 1
or, 1
person., 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
curiosity,, 1
evidently, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
interest., 1
"Monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
whose, 1
uneasiness, 1
was, 1
increased, 1
by, 1
this, 1
examination,, 1
"you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"Yes,, 1
monsieur;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
come?", 1
"The, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French;, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
so, 1
my, 1
cashier, 1
tells, 1
me.", 1
"He, 1
has, 1
told, 1
you, 1
rightly., 1
The, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
had, 1
300,000, 1
or, 1
400,000, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
this, 1
month, 1
in, 1
France;, 1
and,, 1
knowing, 1
your, 1
strict, 1
punctuality,, 1
have, 1
collected, 1
all, 1
the, 1
bills, 1
bearing, 1
your, 1
signature,, 1
and, 1
charged, 1
me, 1
as, 1
they, 1
became, 1
due, 1
to, 1
present, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
employ, 1
the, 1
money, 1
otherwise.", 1
Morrel, 1
sighed, 1
deeply,, 1
and, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
perspiration., 1
"So, 1
then,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"you, 1
hold, 1
bills, 1
of, 1
mine?", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
sum.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
amount?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
he, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
render, 1
firm., 1
"Here, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
papers, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
"an, 1
assignment, 1
of, 1
200,000, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
our, 1
house, 1
by, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
are, 1
due., 1
You, 1
acknowledge,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
owe, 1
this, 1
sum, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
"Yes;, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
money, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands, 1
at, 1
four, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
per, 1

nearly, 1
five, 1

ago.", 1
"When, 1
are, 1
you, 1
to, 1
pay?", 1
"Half, 1

15th, 1
of, 1

"Just, 1
so;, 1

are, 1
32,500, 1
francs, 1
payable, 1
shortly;, 1
they, 1
are, 1
all, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
assigned, 1
to, 1
our, 1
house, 1
by, 1
the, 1
holders.", 1
"I, 1
recognize, 1
them,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
whose, 1
face, 1
was, 1
suffused,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
that,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
in, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
honor, 1
his, 1
own, 1
signature., 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
all?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
for, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month, 1

of, 1
Pascal,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Wild, 1
&, 1
Turner, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
amounting, 1
to, 1
nearly, 1
55,000., 1
francs;, 1
in, 1
all,, 1
287,500, 1
francs.", 1
It, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe, 1
what, 1
Morrel, 1
suffered, 1
during, 1
this, 1
enumeration., 1
"Two, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
eighty-seven, 1
thousand, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
francs,", 1
repeated, 1
he., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
"conceal, 1
from, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
while, 1
your, 1
probity, 1
and, 1
exactitude, 1
up, 1
to, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
are, 1
universally, 1
acknowledged,, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
report, 1
is, 1
current, 1
in, 1
Marseilles, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
able, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
your, 1
liabilities.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
almost, 1
brutal, 1
speech, 1
Morrel, 1
turned, 1
deathly, 1
pale., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"up, 1
to, 1
this, 1
time--and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
now, 1

direction, 1
of, 1
this, 1
house, 1
from, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
conducted, 1
it, 1
for, 1
five, 1
and, 1
thirty, 1
years--never, 1
has, 1
anything, 1
bearing, 1
the, 1
signature, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son, 1
been, 1
dishonored.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
that,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"But, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
honor, 1
should, 1
answer, 1
another,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
fairly,, 1
shall, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
these, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
punctuality?", 1
Morrel, 1
shuddered,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
spoke, 1
with, 1
more, 1
assurance, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
shown., 1
"To, 1
questions, 1
frankly, 1
put,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"a, 1
straightforward, 1
answer, 1
should, 1
be, 1
given., 1
Yes,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
pay,, 1

as, 1
I, 1
hope,, 1
my, 1
vessel, 1
arrives, 1
safely;, 1
for, 1
its, 1
arrival, 1
will, 1
again, 1
procure, 1
me, 1
the, 1
credit, 1
which, 1
the, 1
numerous, 1
accidents,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
victim,, 1
have, 1
deprived, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
should, 1
be, 1
lost,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
last, 1
resource, 1
be, 1
gone"--the, 1
poor, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
tears., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
"if, 1
this, 1
last, 1
resource, 1
fail, 1
you?", 1
"Well,", 1
returned, 1
Morrel,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
cruel, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
but,, 1
already, 1
used, 1
to, 1
misfortune,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
habituate, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
shame., 1
I, 1
fear, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
suspend, 1
payment.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
no, 1
friends, 1
who, 1
could, 1
assist, 1
you?", 1
Morrel, 1
smiled, 1
mournfully., 1
"In, 1
business,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"one, 1
has, 1
no, 1
friends,, 1
only, 1
correspondents.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
Englishman;, 1
"then, 1
you, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
hope.", 1
"But, 1
one.", 1
"The, 1
last?", 1
"The, 1
last.", 1
"So, 1
that, 1
if, 1
this, 1
fail"--, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
ruined,--completely, 1
ruined!", 1
"As, 1
I, 1
was, 1
on, 1
my, 1
way, 1
here,, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
into, 1
port.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
sir;, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
still, 1
adheres, 1
to, 1
my, 1
fallen, 1
fortunes,, 1
passes, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
time, 1
in, 1
a, 1
belvidere, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
in, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
being, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
good, 1
news, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
informed, 1
me, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
this, 1
ship.", 1
"And, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yours?", 1
"No,, 1
she, 1
is, 1
a, 1
Bordeaux, 1
vessel,, 1
La, 1
Gironde;, 1
she, 1
comes, 1
from, 1
India, 1
also;, 1
but, 1
she, 1
is, 1
not, 1
mine.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
she, 1
has, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
and, 1
brings, 1
you, 1
some, 1
tidings, 1
of, 1
her?", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
plainly, 1
one, 1
thing,, 1
sir?, 1
I, 1
dread, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
much, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
any, 1
tidings, 1
of, 1
my, 1
vessel, 1
as, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
doubt., 1
Uncertainty, 1
is, 1
still, 1
hope.", 1
Then, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice, 1
Morrel, 1
added,--"This, 1
delay, 1
is, 1
not, 1
natural., 1
The, 1
Pharaon, 1
left, 1
Calcutta, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
February;, 1
she, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
here, 1
a, 1
month, 1
ago.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
that, 1
noise?", 1
"Oh,, 1
oh!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
turning, 1
pale,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
A, 1
loud, 1
noise, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
of, 1
people, 1
moving, 1
hastily,, 1
and, 1
half-stifled, 1
sobs., 1
Morrel, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
but, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
failed, 1
him, 1
and, 1
he, 1
sank, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
The, 1
two, 1
men, 1
remained, 1
opposite, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
Morrel, 1
trembling, 1
in, 1
every, 1
limb,, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
gazing, 1
at, 1
him, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
pity., 1
The, 1
noise, 1
had, 1
ceased;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
expected, 1
something--something, 1
had, 1
occasioned, 1
the, 1
noise,, 1
and, 1
something, 1
must, 1
follow., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
footsteps, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
footsteps,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
those, 1
of, 1
several, 1
persons,, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
A, 1
key, 1
was, 1
inserted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
hinges, 1
was, 1
audible., 1
"There, 1
are, 1
only, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
have, 1
the, 1
key, 1
to, 1
that, 1
door,", 1
murmured, 1
Morrel,, 1
"Cocles, 1
and, 1
Julie.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
second, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
bathed, 1
with, 1
tears,, 1
appeared., 1
Morrel, 1
rose, 1
tremblingly,, 1
supporting, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chair., 1
He, 1
would, 1
have, 1
spoken,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
failed, 1
him., 1
"Oh,, 1
father!", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
clasping, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
"forgive, 1
your, 1
child, 1
for, 1
being, 1
the, 1
bearer, 1
of, 1
evil, 1
tidings.", 1
Morrel, 1
again, 1
changed, 1
color., 1
Julie, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
"Oh,, 1
father,, 1
father!", 1
murmured, 1
she,, 1
"courage!", 1
"The, 1
Pharaon, 1
has, 1
gone, 1
down,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
did, 1
not, 1
speak;, 1
but, 1
she, 1
made, 1
an, 1
affirmative, 1
sign, 1
with, 1
her, 1
head, 1
as, 1
she, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
her, 1
father's, 1
breast., 1
"And, 1
the, 1
crew?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Saved,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
girl;, 1
"saved, 1
by, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
that, 1
has, 1
just, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
harbor.", 1
Morrel, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
resignation, 1
and, 1
sublime, 1
gratitude., 1
"Thanks,, 1
my, 1
God,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"at, 1
least, 1
thou, 1
strikest, 1
but, 1
me, 1
alone.", 1
A, 1
tear, 1
moistened, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
phlegmatic, 1
Englishman., 1
"Come, 1
in,, 1
come, 1
in,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
presume, 1
you, 1
are, 1
all, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
those, 1
words, 1
than, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
entered, 1
weeping, 1
bitterly., 1
Emmanuel, 1
followed, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
antechamber, 1
were, 1
visible, 1
the, 1
rough, 1
faces, 1
of, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
half-naked, 1
sailors., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
these, 1
men, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
started, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
a, 1
step;, 1
then, 1
restrained, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
retired, 1
into, 1
the, 1
farthest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
obscure, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
by, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
and, 1
took, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
in, 1
hers,, 1
Julie, 1
still, 1
lay, 1
with, 1
her, 1
head, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
Emmanuel, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
form, 1
the, 1
link, 1
between, 1
Morrel's, 1
family, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"How, 1
did, 1
this, 1
happen?", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Draw, 1
nearer,, 1
Penelon,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"and, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
all, 1
about, 1
it.", 1
An, 1
old, 1
seaman,, 1
bronzed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
tropical, 1
sun,, 1
advanced,, 1
twirling, 1
the, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tarpaulin, 1
between, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"Good-day,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
quitted, 1
Marseilles, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
just, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
Aix, 1
or, 1
Toulon., 1
"Good-day,, 1
Penelon,", 1
returned, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
smiling, 1
through, 1
his, 1
tears,, 1
"where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
captain?", 1
"The, 1
captain,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,--he, 1
has, 1
stayed, 1
behind, 1
sick, 1
at, 1
Palma;, 1
but, 1
please, 1
God,, 1
it, 1
won't, 1
be, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days, 1
all, 1
alive, 1
and, 1
hearty.", 1
"Well,, 1
now, 1
tell, 1
your, 1
story,, 1
Penelon.", 1
Penelon, 1
rolled, 1
his, 1
quid, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cheek,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
before, 1
his, 1
mouth,, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
sent, 1
a, 1
long, 1
jet, 1
of, 1
tobacco-juice, 1
into, 1
the, 1
antechamber,, 1
advanced, 1
his, 1
foot,, 1
balanced, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
began,--"You, 1
see,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"we, 1
were, 1
somewhere, 1
between, 1
Cape, 1
Blanc, 1
and, 1
Cape, 1
Boyador,, 1
sailing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fair, 1
breeze,, 1
south-south-west, 1
after, 1
a, 1
week's, 1
calm,, 1
when, 1
Captain, 1
Gaumard, 1
comes, 1
up, 1
to, 1
me--I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
helm, 1
I, 1
should, 1
tell, 1
you--and, 1
says,, 1
'Penelon,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
those, 1
clouds, 1
coming, 1
up, 1
over, 1
there?', 1
I, 1
was, 1
just, 1
then, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
them, 1
myself., 1
'What, 1
do, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
captain?, 1
Why, 1
I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
they, 1
are, 1
rising, 1
faster, 1
than, 1
they, 1
have, 1
any, 1
business, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
black, 1
if, 1
they, 1
didn't, 1
mean, 1
mischief.'--'That's, 1
my, 1
opinion, 1
too,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
'and, 1
I'll, 1
take, 1
precautions, 1
accordingly., 1
We, 1
are, 1
carrying, 1
too, 1
much, 1
canvas., 1
Avast,, 1

hands!, 1
Take, 1
in, 1
the, 1
studding-sl's, 1
and, 1
stow, 1
the, 1
flying, 1
jib.', 1
It, 1
was, 1
time;, 1
the, 1
squall, 1
was, 1
on, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
began, 1
to, 1
heel., 1
'Ah,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
'we, 1
have, 1
still, 1
too, 1
much, 1
canvas, 1
set;, 1
all, 1
hands, 1
lower, 1
the, 1
mains'l!', 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
after,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
down;, 1
and, 1
we, 1
sailed, 1
under, 1
mizzen-tops'ls, 1
and, 1
to'gall'nt, 1
sails., 1
'Well,, 1
Penelon,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
'what, 1
makes, 1
you, 1
shake, 1
your, 1
head?', 1
'Why,', 1
I, 1
says,, 1
'I, 1
still, 1
think, 1
you've, 1
got, 1
too, 1
much, 1
on.', 1
'I, 1
think, 1
you're, 1
right,', 1
answered, 1
he,, 1
'we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
a, 1
gale.', 1
'A, 1
gale?, 1
More, 1
than, 1
that,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
a, 1
tempest,, 1
or, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
what's, 1
what.', 1
You, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
coming, 1
like, 1
the, 1
dust, 1
at, 1
Montredon;, 1
luckily, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
understood, 1
his, 1
business., 1
'Take, 1
in, 1
two, 1
reefs, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tops'ls,', 1
cried, 1
the, 1
captain;, 1
'let, 1
go, 1
the, 1
bowlin's,, 1
haul, 1
the, 1
brace,, 1
lower, 1

to'gall'nt, 1
sails,, 1

reef-tackles, 1
on, 1
the, 1
yards.'", 1
"That, 1
was, 1
not, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
those, 1
latitudes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman;, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
four, 1
reefs, 1
in, 1
the, 1
topsails, 1
and, 1
furled, 1
the, 1
spanker.", 1
His, 1
firm,, 1
sonorous,, 1
and, 1
unexpected, 1
voice, 1
made, 1
every, 1
one, 1
start., 1
Penelon, 1
put, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
stared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
thus, 1
criticized, 1
the, 1
manoeuvres, 1
of, 1
his, 1
captain., 1
"We, 1
did, 1
better, 1
than, 1
that,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
sailor, 1
respectfully;, 1
"we, 1
put, 1
the, 1
helm, 1
up, 1
to, 1
run, 1
before, 1
the, 1
tempest;, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
we, 1
struck, 1

scudded, 1
under, 1
bare, 1
poles.", 1
"The, 1

to, 1
risk, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"Eh,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
that, 1
did, 1
the, 1
business;, 1
after, 1
pitching, 1
heavily, 1
for, 1
twelve, 1
hours, 1
we, 1
sprung, 1
a, 1
leak., 1
'Penelon,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
'I, 1
think, 1
we, 1
are, 1
sinking,, 1
give, 1
me, 1
the, 1
helm,, 1
and, 1
go, 1
down, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hold.', 1
I, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
the, 1
helm,, 1
and, 1
descended;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
already, 1
three, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
water., 1
'All, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pumps!', 1
I, 1
shouted;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
too, 1
late,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
the, 1
more, 1
we, 1
pumped, 1
the, 1
more, 1
came, 1
in., 1
'Ah,', 1
said, 1
I,, 1
after, 1
four, 1
hours', 1
work,, 1
'since, 1
we, 1
are, 1
sinking,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
sink;, 1
we, 1
can, 1
die, 1
but, 1
once.', 1
'That's, 1
the, 1
example, 1
you, 1
set,, 1
Penelon,', 1
cries, 1
the, 1
captain;, 1
'very, 1
well,, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
minute.', 1
He, 1
went, 1
into, 1
his, 1
cabin, 1
and, 1
came, 1
back, 1
with, 1
a, 1
brace, 1
of, 1
pistols., 1
'I, 1
will, 1
blow, 1
the, 1
brains, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
man, 1
who, 1
leaves, 1
the, 1

said, 1
he.", 1
"Well, 1
done!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman., 1
"There's, 1
nothing, 1
gives, 1
you, 1
so, 1
much, 1
courage, 1
as, 1
good, 1
reasons,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
sailor;, 1
"and, 1
during, 1
that, 1
time, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
had, 1
abated,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
gone, 1
down,, 1

the, 1
water, 1
kept, 1
rising;, 1
not, 1
much,, 1
only, 1
two, 1
inches, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
but, 1
still, 1
it, 1
rose., 1
Two, 1
inches, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
does, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
much,, 1

in, 1
twelve, 1
hours, 1
that, 1
makes, 1
two, 1
feet,, 1
and, 1
three, 1
we, 1
had, 1
before,, 1

five., 1
'Come,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
'we, 1
have, 1
done, 1
all, 1
in, 1
our, 1
power,, 1

us, 1
now, 1
save, 1
ourselves., 1

the, 1
boats,, 1
my, 1
lads,, 1
as, 1
quick, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can.', 1
Now,", 1
continued, 1
Penelon,, 1
"you, 1
see,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
is, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ship,, 1
but, 1
still, 1
more, 1
to, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
so, 1
we, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
to, 1
be, 1
told, 1
twice;, 1
the, 1
more, 1
so,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
was, 1
sinking, 1
under, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
'Get, 1
along--save, 1
yourselves.', 1
We, 1
soon, 1
launched, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
eight, 1
of, 1
us, 1
got, 1
into, 1
it., 1
The, 1
captain, 1
descended, 1
last,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
descend,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
vessel;, 1
so, 1
I, 1
took, 1
him, 1
round, 1
the, 1
waist,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
jumped, 1
after, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
time,, 1
for, 1
just, 1
as, 1
I, 1
jumped, 1
the, 1
deck, 1
burst, 1
with, 1
a, 1
noise, 1
like, 1
the, 1
broadside, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man-of-war., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
she, 1
pitched, 1
forward,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
other, 1
way,, 1
spun, 1
round, 1
and, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
good-by, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Pharaon., 1
As, 1
for, 1
us,, 1
we, 1
were, 1
three, 1
days, 1
without, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
or, 1
drink,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
we, 1
began, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
drawing, 1
lots, 1
who, 1
should, 1
feed, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
saw, 1
La, 1
Gironde;, 1
we, 1
made, 1
signals, 1
of, 1
distress,, 1
she, 1
perceived, 1
us,, 1
made, 1
for, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
us, 1
all, 1
on, 1
board., 1
There, 1
now,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
that's, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
truth,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sailor;, 1
is, 1
not, 1
it, 1
true,, 1
you, 1
fellows, 1
there?", 1
A, 1
general, 1
murmur, 1
of, 1
approbation, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
narrator, 1
had, 1
faithfully, 1
detailed, 1
their, 1
misfortunes, 1
and, 1
sufferings., 1
"Well,, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
one, 1
in, 1
fault, 1
but, 1
destiny., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
God, 1
that, 1
this, 1
should, 1
happen,, 1
blessed, 1
be, 1
his, 1
name., 1
What, 1
wages, 1
are, 1
due, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
don't, 1
let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
M., 1
Morrel.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
we, 1
will, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
three, 1
months,", 1
said, 1
Penelon., 1
"Cocles,, 1
pay, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
each, 1
of, 1
these, 1
good, 1
fellows,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"At, 1
another, 1
time,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
Give, 1
them,, 1
besides,, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
over, 1
as, 1
a, 1
present;, 1
but, 1
times, 1
are, 1
changed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
little, 1
money, 1
that, 1
remains, 1
to, 1
me, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
own.", 1
Penelon, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companions,, 1
and, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
with, 1
them., 1
"As, 1
for, 1
that,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
again, 1
turning, 1
his, 1
quid,, 1
"as, 1
for, 1
that"--, 1
"As, 1
for, 1
what?", 1
"The, 1
money.", 1
"Well"--, 1
"Well,, 1
we, 1
all, 1
say, 1
that, 1
fifty, 1
francs, 1
will, 1
be, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
us, 1
at, 1
present,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
we, 1
will, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
the, 1
rest.", 1
"Thanks,, 1
my, 1
friends,, 1
thanks!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel, 1
gratefully;, 1
"take, 1
it--take, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
can, 1
find, 1
another, 1
employer,, 1
enter, 1
his, 1
service;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
free, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
These, 1
last, 1
words, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
prodigious, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
the, 1
seaman., 1
Penelon, 1
nearly, 1
swallowed, 1
his, 1
quid;, 1
fortunately, 1
he, 1
recovered., 1
"What,, 1
M., 1
Morrel!", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
"you, 1
send, 1
us, 1
away;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
then, 1
angry, 1
with, 1
us!", 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
angry,, 1
quite, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
send, 1
you, 1
away;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
more, 1
ships,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
want, 1
any, 1
sailors.", 1
"No, 1
more, 1
ships!", 1
returned, 1
Penelon;, 1
"well,, 1
then,, 1
you'll, 1
build, 1
some;, 1
we'll, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
money, 1
to, 1
build, 1
ships, 1
with,, 1
Penelon,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
owner, 1
mournfully,, 1
"so, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
accept, 1
your, 1
kind, 1
offer.", 1
"No, 1
more, 1
money?, 1
Then, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
pay, 1
us;, 1
we, 1
can, 1
scud,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
under, 1
bare, 1
poles.", 1
"Enough,, 1
enough!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
almost, 1
overpowered;, 1
"leave, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
you;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
meet, 1
again, 1
in, 1
a, 1
happier, 1
time., 1
Emmanuel,, 1
go, 1
with, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
see, 1
that, 1
my, 1
orders, 1
are, 1
executed.", 1
"At, 1
least,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
see, 1
each, 1
other, 1
again,, 1
M., 1
Morrel?", 1
asked, 1
Penelon., 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
so,, 1
at, 1
least., 1
Now, 1
go.", 1
He, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
Cocles,, 1
who, 1
went, 1
first;, 1
the, 1
seamen, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
the, 1
rear., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
daughter,, 1
"leave, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
this, 1
gentleman.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
glanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
clerk, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
during, 1
this, 1
scene,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
no, 1
part,, 1
except, 1
the, 1
few, 1
words, 1
we, 1
have, 1
mentioned., 1
The, 1
two, 1
women, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
this, 1
person, 1
whose, 1
presence, 1
they, 1
had, 1
entirely, 1
forgotten,, 1
and, 1
retired;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
left, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
Julie, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
a, 1
supplicating, 1
glance,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
that, 1
an, 1
indifferent, 1
spectator, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
surprised, 1
to, 1
see, 1
on, 1
his, 1
stern, 1
features., 1
The, 1
two, 1
men, 1
were, 1
left, 1
alone., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
sinking, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
further, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
see,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
"that, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
and, 1
unmerited, 1
misfortune, 1
his, 1
overwhelmed, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
only, 1
increases, 1
my, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,, 1
sir!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel., 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
see,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
one, 1
of, 1
your, 1
largest, 1
creditors.", 1
"Your, 1
bills,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
are, 1
the, 1
first, 1
that, 1
will, 1
fall, 1
due.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
time, 1
to, 1
pay?", 1
"A, 1
delay, 1
would, 1
save, 1
my, 1
honor,, 1
and, 1
consequently, 1
my, 1
life.", 1
"How, 1
long, 1
a, 1
delay, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for?"--Morrel, 1
reflected., 1
"Two, 1
months,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
three,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
stranger., 1
"But,", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
"will, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
consent?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
take, 1
everything, 1
on, 1
myself., 1
To-day, 1
is, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
June.", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
renew, 1
these, 1
bills, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
September;, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
September, 1
at, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
(the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
eleven),, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
come, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
the, 1
money.", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
expect, 1
you,", 1
returned, 1
Morrel;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
pay, 1
you--or, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
dead.", 1
These, 1
last, 1
words, 1
were, 1
uttered, 1
in, 1
so, 1
low, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
could, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
them., 1
The, 1
bills, 1
were, 1
renewed,, 1
the, 1
old, 1
ones, 1
destroyed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
ship-owner, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
three, 1
months, 1
before, 1
him, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
his, 1
resources., 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
received, 1
his, 1
thanks, 1
with, 1
the, 1
phlegm, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
his, 1
nation;, 1
and, 1
Morrel,, 1
overwhelming, 1
him, 1
with, 1
grateful, 1
blessings,, 1
conducted, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
staircase., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
met, 1
Julie, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs;, 1
she, 1
pretended, 1
to, 1
be, 1
descending,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
she, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him., 1
"Oh,, 1
sir"--said, 1
she,, 1
clasping, 1
her, 1
hands., 1
"Mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
"one, 1
day, 1
you, 1
will, 1
receive, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
signed, 1
'Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.', 1
Do, 1
exactly, 1
what, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
bids, 1
you,, 1
however, 1
strange, 1
it, 1
may, 1
appear.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
returned, 1
Julie., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
promise?", 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you, 1
I, 1
will.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well., 1
Adieu,, 1

to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
good,, 1
sweet, 1
girl, 1

are, 1
at, 1
present,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
great, 1
hopes, 1
that, 1
heaven, 1
will, 1
reward, 1
you, 1
by, 1
giving, 1
you, 1
Emmanuel, 1
for, 1
a, 1
husband.", 1
Julie, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
cry,, 1
blushed, 1
like, 1
a, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
the, 1
baluster., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
waved, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
descend., 1
In, 1
the, 1
court, 1
he, 1
found, 1
Penelon,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
rouleau, 1
of, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
either, 1
hand,, 1
seemed, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
retain, 1
them., 1
"Come, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman;, 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
Chapter, 1
30., 1
The, 1
Fifth, 1
of, 1
September., 1
The, 1
extension, 1
provided, 1
for, 1
by, 1
the, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
Morrel, 1
expected, 1
it, 1
least,, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
shipowner, 1
so, 1
decided, 1
a, 1
stroke, 1
of, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
that, 1
he, 1
almost, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
fate, 1
was, 1
at, 1
length, 1
grown, 1
weary, 1
of, 1
wasting, 1
her, 1
spite, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
The, 1
same, 1
day, 1
he, 1
told, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
all, 1
that, 1
had, 1
occurred;, 1
and, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
hope,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
of, 1
tranquillity,, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
family., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
however,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
not, 1
only, 1
engagements, 1
with, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
shown, 1
themselves, 1
so, 1
considerate, 1
towards, 1
him;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
business, 1
he, 1
had, 1
correspondents,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
friends., 1
When, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
over,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
account, 1
for, 1
this, 1
generous, 1
conduct, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
towards, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
could, 1
only, 1
attribute, 1
it, 1
to, 1
some, 1
such, 1
selfish, 1
argument, 1
as, 1
this:--"We, 1
had, 1
better, 1
help, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
owes, 1
us, 1
nearly, 1
300,000, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
those, 1
300,000, 1
francs, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
three, 1
months, 1
than, 1
hasten, 1
his, 1
ruin,, 1
and, 1
get, 1
only, 1
six, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
per, 1
cent, 1
of, 1
our, 1
money, 1
back, 1
again.", 1
Unfortunately,, 1
whether, 1
through, 1
envy, 1
or, 1
stupidity,, 1
all, 1
Morrel's, 1
correspondents, 1
did, 1
not, 1
take, 1
this, 1
view;, 1
and, 1
some, 1
even, 1
came, 1
to, 1
a, 1
contrary, 1
decision., 1
The, 1
bills, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
Morrel, 1
were, 1
presented, 1
at, 1
his, 1
office, 1
with, 1
scrupulous, 1
exactitude,, 1
and,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
delay, 1
granted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
were, 1
paid, 1
by, 1
Cocles, 1
with, 1
equal, 1
punctuality., 1
Cocles, 1
thus, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
accustomed, 1
tranquillity., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Morrel, 1
alone, 1
who, 1
remembered, 1
with, 1
alarm,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
repay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
15th, 1
the, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
30th, 1
the, 1
32,500, 1
francs, 1
of, 1
bills,, 1
for, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
debt, 1
due, 1
to, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
time, 1
granted,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
ruined, 1
man., 1
The, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
commercial, 1
men, 1
was, 1
that,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
reverses, 1
which, 1
had, 1
successively, 1
weighed, 1
down, 1
Morrel,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
solvent., 1
Great,, 1
therefore,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
astonishment, 1
when, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month,, 1
he, 1
cancelled, 1
all, 1
his, 1
obligations, 1
with, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
punctuality., 1
Still, 1
confidence, 1
was, 1
not, 1
restored, 1
to, 1
all, 1
minds,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
general, 1
opinion, 1
was, 1
that, 1
the, 1
complete, 1
ruin, 1
of, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
shipowner, 1
had, 1
been, 1
postponed, 1
only, 1
until, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month., 1
The, 1
month, 1
passed,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
made, 1
extraordinary, 1
efforts, 1
to, 1
get, 1
in, 1
all, 1
his, 1
resources., 1
Formerly, 1
his, 1
paper,, 1
at, 1
any, 1
date,, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
with, 1
confidence,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
even, 1
in, 1
request., 1
Morrel, 1
now, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
negotiate, 1
bills, 1
at, 1
ninety, 1
days, 1
only,, 1
and, 1
none, 1
of, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
would, 1
give, 1
him, 1
credit., 1
Fortunately,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
some, 1
funds, 1
coming, 1
in, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
rely;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
condition, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
his, 1
engagements, 1
when, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
July, 1
came., 1
The, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
again, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
Marseilles;, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after,, 1
or, 1
two, 1
days, 1
after, 1
his, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
disappeared;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
in, 1
that, 1
city, 1
he, 1
had, 1
had, 1
no, 1
intercourse, 1
but, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mayor,, 1
the, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
his, 1
departure, 1
left, 1
no, 1
trace, 1
except, 1
in, 1
the, 1
memories, 1
of, 1
these, 1
three, 1
persons., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pharaon,, 1
they, 1
must, 1
have, 1
found, 1
snug, 1
berths, 1
elsewhere,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
also, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
Captain, 1
Gaumard,, 1
recovered, 1
from, 1
his, 1
illness,, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
Palma., 1
He, 1
delayed, 1
presenting, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
Morrel's,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
hearing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
arrival,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him., 1
The, 1
worthy, 1
shipowner, 1
knew,, 1
from, 1
Penelon's, 1
recital,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
captain's, 1
brave, 1
conduct, 1
during, 1
the, 1
storm,, 1
and, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
console, 1
him., 1
He, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
also, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wages,, 1
which, 1
Captain, 1
Gaumard, 1
had, 1
not, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
apply, 1
for., 1
As, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
Morrel, 1
met, 1
Penelon,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
going, 1
up., 1
Penelon, 1
had,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
seem,, 1
made, 1
good, 1
use, 1
of, 1
his, 1
money,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
was, 1
newly, 1
clad., 1
When, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
employer,, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
tar, 1
seemed, 1
much, 1
embarrassed,, 1
drew, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side, 1
into, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
landing-place,, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
quid, 1
from, 1
one, 1
cheek, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
stared, 1
stupidly, 1
with, 1
his, 1
great, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
acknowledged, 1
the, 1
squeeze, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
which, 1
Morrel, 1
as, 1
usual, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
by, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
pressure, 1
in, 1
return., 1
Morrel, 1
attributed, 1
Penelon's, 1
embarrassment, 1
to, 1
the, 1
elegance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
attire;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fellow, 1
had, 1
not, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
such, 1
an, 1
expense, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
account;, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
engaged, 1
on, 1
board, 1
some, 1
other, 1
vessel,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
his, 1
bashfulness, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
of, 1
his, 1
not, 1
having,, 1
if, 1
we, 1
may, 1
so, 1
express, 1
ourselves,, 1
worn, 1
mourning, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
longer., 1
Perhaps, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
Captain, 1
Gaumard, 1
of, 1
his, 1
good, 1
luck,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
him, 1
employment, 1
from, 1
his, 1
new, 1
master., 1
"Worthy, 1
fellows!", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
"may, 1
your, 1
new, 1
master, 1
love, 1
you, 1
as, 1
I, 1
loved, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
more, 1
fortunate, 1
than, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been!", 1
August, 1
rolled, 1
by, 1
in, 1
unceasing, 1
efforts, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
his, 1
credit, 1
or, 1
revive, 1
the, 1
old., 1
On, 1
the, 1
20th, 1
of, 1
August, 1
it, 1
was, 1
known, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
town, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mailcoach,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
it, 1
was, 1
said, 1
that, 1
the, 1
bills, 1
would, 1
go, 1
to, 1
protest, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
away, 1
and, 1
left, 1
his, 1
chief, 1
clerk, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
cashier, 1
Cocles,, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
creditors., 1
But,, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
all, 1
expectation,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
31st, 1
of, 1
August, 1
came,, 1
the, 1
house, 1
opened, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
and, 1
Cocles, 1
appeared, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
grating, 1
of, 1
the, 1
counter,, 1
examined, 1
all, 1
bills, 1
presented, 1
with, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
scrutiny,, 1
and,, 1
from, 1
first, 1
to, 1
last,, 1
paid, 1
all, 1
with, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
precision., 1
There, 1
came, 1
in,, 1
moreover,, 1
two, 1
drafts, 1
which, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
fully, 1
anticipated,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
Cocles, 1
paid, 1
as, 1
punctually, 1
as, 1
the, 1
bills, 1
which, 1
the, 1
shipowner, 1
had, 1
accepted., 1
All, 1
this, 1
was, 1
incomprehensible,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
tenacity, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
prophets, 1
of, 1
bad, 1
news,, 1
the, 1
failure, 1
was, 1
put, 1
off, 1
until, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
September., 1
On, 1
the, 1
1st,, 1
Morrel, 1
returned;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
awaited, 1
by, 1
his, 1
family, 1
with, 1
extreme, 1
anxiety,, 1
for, 1
from, 1
this, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
Paris, 1
they, 1
hoped, 1
great, 1
things., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
now, 1
immensely, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
lain, 1
under, 1
great, 1
obligations, 1
to, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
former, 1
days,, 1
since, 1
to, 1
him, 1
it, 1
was, 1
owing, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
service, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
banker,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
foundations, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vast, 1
wealth., 1
It, 1
was, 1
said, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
worth, 1
from, 1
six, 1
to, 1
eight, 1
millions, 1
of, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
unlimited, 1
credit., 1
Danglars,, 1
then,, 1
without, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
crown, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
could, 1
save, 1
Morrel;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
but, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
his, 1
word, 1
for, 1
a, 1
loan,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
saved., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
long, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
but, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
away, 1
from, 1
some, 1
instinctive, 1
motive,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
delayed, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
this, 1
last, 1
resource., 1
And, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
right,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
home, 1
crushed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
humiliation, 1
of, 1
a, 1
refusal., 1
Yet,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
arrival,, 1
Morrel, 1
did, 1
not, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
complaint,, 1
or, 1
say, 1
one, 1
harsh, 1
word., 1
He, 1
embraced, 1
his, 1
weeping, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
daughter,, 1
pressed, 1
Emmanuel's, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
friendly, 1
warmth,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
going, 1
to, 1
his, 1
private, 1
room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
floor, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
Cocles., 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
two, 1
women, 1
to, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
indeed, 1
ruined.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
agreed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
council, 1
held, 1
among, 1
them,, 1
that, 1
Julie, 1
should, 1
write, 1
to, 1
her, 1
brother,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
garrison, 1
at, 1
Nimes,, 1
to, 1
come, 1
to, 1
them, 1
as, 1
speedily, 1
as, 1
possible., 1
The, 1
poor, 1
women, 1
felt, 1
instinctively, 1
that, 1
they, 1
required, 1
all, 1
their, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
support, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
that, 1
impended., 1
Besides,, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1
though, 1
hardly, 1
two, 1
and, 1
twenty,, 1
had, 1
great, 1
influence, 1
over, 1
his, 1
father., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
strong-minded,, 1
upright, 1
young, 1
man., 1
At, 1
the, 1
time, 1
when, 1
he, 1
decided, 1
on, 1
his, 1
profession, 1
his, 1
father, 1
had, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
choose, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
had, 1
consulted, 1
young, 1
Maximilian's, 1
taste., 1
He, 1
had, 1
at, 1
once, 1
declared, 1
for, 1
a, 1
military, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
studied, 1
hard,, 1
passed, 1
brilliantly, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Polytechnic, 1
School,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
it, 1
as, 1
sub-lieutenant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
53d, 1
of, 1
the, 1
line., 1
For, 1
a, 1
year, 1
he, 1
had, 1
held, 1
this, 1
rank,, 1
and, 1
expected, 1
promotion, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
vacancy., 1
In, 1
his, 1
regiment, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
noted, 1
for, 1
his, 1
rigid, 1
observance,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
of, 1
the, 1
obligations, 1
imposed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
soldier,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
of, 1
the, 1
duties, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
thus, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
"the, 1
stoic.", 1
We, 1
need, 1
hardly, 1
say, 1
that, 1
many, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
this, 1
epithet, 1
repeated, 1
it, 1
because, 1
they, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
know, 1
what, 1
it, 1
meant., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
sister, 1
called, 1
to, 1
their, 1
aid, 1
to, 1
sustain, 1
them, 1
under, 1
the, 1
serious, 1
trial, 1
which, 1
they, 1
felt, 1
they, 1
would, 1
soon, 1
have, 1
to, 1
endure., 1
They, 1
had, 1
not, 1
mistaken, 1
the, 1
gravity, 1
of, 1
this, 1
event,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
after, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
private, 1
office, 1
with, 1
Cocles,, 1
Julie, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
leave, 1
it, 1
pale,, 1
trembling,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
features, 1
betraying, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
consternation., 1
She, 1
would, 1
have, 1
questioned, 1
him, 1
as, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
creature, 1
hastened, 1
down, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
with, 1
unusual, 1
precipitation,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
and, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"Oh,, 1
mademoiselle,, 1
mademoiselle,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
misfortune!, 1
Who, 1
could, 1
ever, 1
have, 1
believed, 1
it!", 1
A, 1
moment, 1
afterwards, 1
Julie, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
go, 1
up-stairs, 1
carrying, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
heavy, 1
ledgers,, 1
a, 1
portfolio,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bag, 1
of, 1
money., 1
Morrel, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
ledgers,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
portfolio,, 1
and, 1
counted, 1
the, 1
money., 1
All, 1
his, 1
funds, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
6,000,, 1
or, 1
8,000., 1
francs,, 1
his, 1
bills, 1
receivable, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
to, 1
4,000, 1
or, 1
5,000,, 1
which,, 1
making, 1
the, 1
best, 1
of, 1
everything,, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
14,000., 1
francs, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
debts, 1
amounting, 1
to, 1
287,500, 1
francs., 1
He, 1
had, 1
not, 1
even, 1
the, 1
means, 1
for, 1
making, 1
a, 1
possible, 1
settlement, 1
on, 1
account., 1
However,, 1
when, 1
Morrel, 1
went, 1
down, 1
to, 1
his, 1
dinner,, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
very, 1
calm., 1
This, 1
calmness, 1
was, 1
more, 1
alarming, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
women, 1
than, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
dejection, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been., 1
After, 1
dinner, 1
Morrel, 1
usually, 1
went, 1
out, 1
and, 1
used, 1
to, 1
take, 1
his, 1
coffee, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Phocaean, 1
club,, 1
and, 1
read, 1
the, 1
Semaphore;, 1
this, 1
day, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
but, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
office., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Cocles,, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
completely, 1
bewildered., 1
For, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
he, 1
went, 1
into, 1
the, 1
court-yard,, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
bare, 1
and, 1
exposed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
blazing, 1
sun., 1
Emmanuel, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
comfort, 1
the, 1
women,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
eloquence, 1
faltered., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
too, 1
well, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
a, 1
great, 1
catastrophe, 1
hung, 1
over, 1
the, 1
Morrel, 1
family., 1
Night, 1
came,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
women, 1
had, 1
watched,, 1
hoping, 1
that, 1
when, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his, 1
room, 1
Morrel, 1
would, 1
come, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
pass, 1
before, 1
their, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
his, 1
footsteps., 1
They, 1
listened;, 1
he, 1
went, 1
into, 1
his, 1
sleeping-room,, 1
and, 1
fastened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
inside., 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
sent, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
to, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
after, 1
Julie, 1
had, 1
retired,, 1
she, 1
rose,, 1
took, 1
off, 1
her, 1
shoes,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
stealthily, 1
along, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
through, 1
the, 1
keyhole, 1
what, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
was, 1
doing., 1
In, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
retreating, 1
shadow;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Julie,, 1
who,, 1
uneasy, 1
herself,, 1
had, 1
anticipated, 1
her, 1
mother., 1
The, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
writing,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
They, 1
had, 1
understood, 1
each, 1
other, 1
without, 1
speaking., 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
again, 1
through, 1
the, 1
keyhole,, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
writing;, 1
but, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
remarked,, 1
what, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
had, 1
not, 1
observed,, 1
that, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
was, 1
writing, 1
on, 1
stamped, 1
paper., 1
The, 1
terrible, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
writing, 1
his, 1
will, 1
flashed, 1
across, 1
her;, 1
she, 1
shuddered,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
had, 1
not, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
word., 1
Next, 1
day, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
calm, 1
as, 1
ever,, 1
went, 1
into, 1
his, 1
office, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
his, 1
breakfast, 1
punctually,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
after, 1
dinner,, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
beside, 1
him,, 1
took, 1
her, 1
head, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
her, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
against, 1
his, 1
bosom., 1
In, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
Julie, 1
told, 1
her, 1
mother,, 1
that, 1
although, 1
he, 1
was, 1
apparently, 1
so, 1
calm,, 1
she, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
her, 1
father's, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
violently., 1
The, 1
next, 1
two, 1
days, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
much, 1
the, 1
same, 1
way., 1
On, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
4th, 1
of, 1
September,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
asked, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
for, 1
the, 1
key, 1
of, 1
his, 1
study., 1
Julie, 1
trembled, 1
at, 1
this, 1
request,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
her, 1
of, 1
bad, 1
omen., 1
Why, 1
did, 1
her, 1
father, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
this, 1
key, 1
which, 1
she, 1
always, 1
kept,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
only, 1
taken, 1
from, 1
her, 1
in, 1
childhood, 1
as, 1
a, 1
punishment?, 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Morrel., 1
"What, 1
have, 1
I, 1
done, 1
wrong,, 1
father,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
take, 1
this, 1
key, 1
from, 1
me?", 1
"Nothing,, 1
my, 1
dear,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
man,, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
starting, 1
to, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
at, 1
this, 1
simple, 1
question,--"nothing,, 1
only, 1
I, 1
want, 1
it.", 1
Julie, 1
made, 1
a, 1
pretence, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
for, 1
the, 1
key., 1
"I, 1
must, 1
have, 1
left, 1
it, 1
in, 1
my, 1
room,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
And, 1
she, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
but, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
going, 1
to, 1
her, 1
apartment, 1
she, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
consult, 1
Emmanuel., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
give, 1
this, 1
key, 1
to, 1
your, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"and, 1
to-morrow, 1
morning,, 1
if, 1
possible,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment.", 1
She, 1
questioned, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
nothing,, 1
or, 1
would, 1
not, 1
say, 1
what, 1
he, 1
knew., 1
During, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
4th, 1
and, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
September,, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
remained, 1
listening, 1
for, 1
every, 1
sound,, 1
and,, 1
until, 1
three, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
great, 1
agitation., 1
It, 1
was, 1
three, 1
o'clock, 1
when, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
The, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
daughter, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night, 1
together., 1
They, 1
had, 1
expected, 1
Maximilian, 1
since, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening., 1
At, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
Morrel, 1
entered, 1
their, 1
chamber., 1
He, 1
was, 1
calm;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
agitation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night, 1
was, 1
legible, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
careworn, 1
visage., 1
They, 1
did, 1
not, 1
dare, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
him, 1
how, 1
he, 1
had, 1
slept., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
kinder, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
more, 1
affectionate, 1
to, 1
his, 1
daughter,, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
been., 1
He, 1
could, 1
not, 1
cease, 1
gazing, 1
at, 1
and, 1
kissing, 1
the, 1
sweet, 1
girl., 1
Julie,, 1
mindful, 1
of, 1
Emmanuel's, 1
request,, 1
was, 1
following, 1
her, 1
father, 1
when, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
her, 1
quickly,--"Remain, 1
with, 1
your, 1
mother,, 1
dearest.", 1
Julie, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
you, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
so, 1
spoken,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
said, 1
it, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
paternal, 1
kindness,, 1
and, 1
Julie, 1
did, 1
not, 1
dare, 1
to, 1
disobey., 1
She, 1
remained, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
spot, 1
standing, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
motionless., 1
An, 1
instant, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
two, 1
arms, 1
encircle, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
mouth, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
forehead., 1
She, 1
looked, 1
up, 1
and, 1
uttered, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
joy., 1
"Maximilian,, 1
my, 1
dearest, 1
brother!", 1
she, 1
cried., 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
arms., 1
"Mother,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
looking, 1
alternately, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
"what, 1
has, 1
occurred--what, 1
has, 1
happened?, 1
Your, 1
letter, 1
has, 1
frightened, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come, 1
hither, 1
with, 1
all, 1
speed.", 1
"Julie,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"go, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
your, 1
father, 1
that, 1
Maximilian, 1
has, 1
just, 1
arrived.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
step, 1
of, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
she, 1
found, 1
a, 1
man, 1
holding, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Julie, 1
Morrel?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
Italian, 1
accent., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Julie, 1
with, 1
hesitation;, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
your, 1
pleasure?, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
you.", 1
"Read, 1
this, 1
letter,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
handing, 1
it, 1
to, 1
her., 1
Julie, 1
hesitated., 1
"It, 1
concerns, 1
the, 1
best, 1
interests, 1
of, 1
your, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
messenger., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
hastily, 1
took, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
him., 1
She, 1
opened, 1
it, 1
quickly, 1
and, 1
read:--, 1
"Go, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
house, 1
No., 1
15,, 1
ask, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
for, 1
the, 1
key, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
floor,, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
take, 1
from, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mantelpiece, 1
a, 1
purse, 1
netted, 1
in, 1
red, 1
silk,, 1
and, 1
give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
your, 1
father., 1
It, 1
is, 1
important, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
receive, 1
it, 1
before, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock., 1
You, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
obey, 1
me, 1
implicitly., 1
Remember, 1
your, 1
oath., 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
joyful, 1
cry,, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
looked, 1
round, 1
to, 1
question, 1
the, 1
messenger,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
She, 1
cast, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
again, 1
over, 1
the, 1
note, 1
to, 1
peruse, 1
it, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
postscript., 1
She, 1
read:--, 1
"It, 1

should, 1
fulfil, 1
this, 1
mission, 1
in, 1
person, 1
and, 1
alone., 1
If, 1
you, 1
go, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
any, 1
other, 1
person,, 1
or, 1
should, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
go, 1
in, 1
your, 1
place,, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
will, 1
reply, 1
that, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know, 1
anything, 1
about, 1
it.", 1
This, 1
postscript, 1
decreased, 1
greatly, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
happiness., 1
Was, 1
there, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
fear?, 1
was, 1
there, 1
not, 1
some, 1
snare, 1
laid, 1
for, 1
her?, 1
Her, 1
innocence, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
her, 1
in, 1
ignorance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dangers, 1
that, 1
might, 1
assail, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
her, 1
age., 1
But, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
need, 1
to, 1
know, 1
danger, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
it;, 1
indeed,, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be, 1
observed,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
usually, 1
unknown, 1
perils, 1
that, 1
inspire, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
terror., 1
Julie, 1
hesitated,, 1
and, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
take, 1
counsel., 1
Yet,, 1
through, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
impulse,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
neither, 1
to, 1
her, 1
mother, 1
nor, 1
her, 1
brother, 1
that, 1
she, 1
applied,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
Emmanuel., 1
She, 1
hastened, 1
down, 1
and, 1
told, 1
him, 1
what, 1
had, 1
occurred, 1
on, 1
the, 1
day, 1
when, 1
the, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
her, 1
father's,, 1
related, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
she, 1
had, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
him, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"You, 1
must, 1
go,, 1
then,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
Emmanuel., 1
"Go, 1
there?", 1
murmured, 1
Julie., 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
accompany, 1
you.", 1
"But, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
read, 1
that, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
alone?", 1
said, 1
Julie., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
alone,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
await, 1
you, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Musee,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
so, 1
long, 1
absent, 1
as, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
uneasy,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
rejoin, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
woe, 1
to, 1
him, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
complain, 1
to, 1
me!", 1
"Then,, 1
Emmanuel?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
with, 1
hesitation,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
your, 1
opinion, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
obey, 1
this, 1
invitation?", 1
"Yes., 1
Did, 1
not, 1
the, 1
messenger, 1
say, 1
your, 1
father's, 1
safety, 1
depended, 1
upon, 1
it?", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
danger, 1
threatens, 1
him,, 1
then,, 1
Emmanuel?", 1
she, 1
asked., 1
Emmanuel, 1
hesitated, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
make, 1
Julie, 1
decide, 1
immediately, 1
made, 1
him, 1
reply., 1
"Listen,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"to-day, 1
is, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
September,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"To-day,, 1
then,, 1
at, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock,, 1
your, 1
father, 1
has, 1
nearly, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
pay?", 1
"Yes,, 1
we, 1
know, 1
that.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
continued, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
not, 1
fifteen, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house.", 1
"What, 1
will, 1
happen, 1
then?", 1
"Why,, 1
if, 1
to-day, 1
before, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
your, 1
father, 1
has, 1
not, 1
found, 1
someone, 1
who, 1
will, 1
come, 1
to, 1
his, 1
aid,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
compelled, 1
at, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock, 1
to, 1
declare, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
bankrupt.", 1
"Oh,, 1
come,, 1
then,, 1
come!", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
hastening, 1
away, 1
with, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
told, 1
her, 1
son, 1
everything., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
knew, 1
quite, 1
well, 1
that,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
succession, 1
of, 1
misfortunes, 1
which, 1
had, 1
befallen, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
great, 1
changes, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
style, 1
of, 1
living, 1
and, 1
housekeeping;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
matters, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
such, 1
a, 1
point., 1
He, 1
was, 1
thunderstruck., 1
Then,, 1
rushing, 1
hastily, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
he, 1
ran, 1
up-stairs,, 1
expecting, 1
to, 1
find, 1
his, 1
father, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
rapped, 1
there, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
While, 1
he, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
study, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
bedroom, 1
door, 1
open,, 1
turned,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
father., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
going, 1
direct, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bed-chamber,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
quitting., 1
Morrel, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
surprise, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
of, 1
whose, 1
arrival, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ignorant., 1
He, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spot,, 1
pressing, 1
with, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand, 1
something, 1
he, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
under, 1
his, 1
coat., 1
Maximilian, 1
sprang, 1
down, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
round, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
neck;, 1
but, 1
suddenly, 1
he, 1
recoiled,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
Morrel's, 1
breast., 1
"Father,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
turning, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
death,, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
that, 1
brace, 1
of, 1
pistols, 1
under, 1
your, 1
coat?", 1
"Oh,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
feared!", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Father,, 1
father,, 1
in, 1
heaven's, 1
name,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
these, 1
weapons, 1
for?", 1
"Maximilian,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel,, 1
looking, 1
fixedly, 1
at, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
honor., 1
Come,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
And, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
step, 1
Morrel, 1
went, 1
up, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
while, 1
Maximilian, 1
followed, 1
him,, 1
trembling, 1
as, 1
he, 1
went., 1
Morrel, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
closed, 1
it, 1
behind, 1
his, 1
son;, 1
then,, 1
crossing, 1
the, 1
anteroom,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
his, 1
desk, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
pistols,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
to, 1
an, 1
open, 1
ledger., 1
In, 1
this, 1
ledger, 1
was, 1
made, 1
out, 1
an, 1
exact, 1
balance-sheet, 1
of, 1
his, 1
affair's., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
to, 1
pay,, 1
within, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
287,500, 1
francs., 1
All, 1
he, 1
possessed, 1
was, 1
15,257, 1
francs., 1
"Read!", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
overwhelmed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
read., 1
Morrel, 1
said, 1
not, 1
a, 1
word., 1
What, 1
could, 1
he, 1
say?, 1
What, 1
need, 1
he, 1
add, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
desperate, 1
proof, 1
in, 1
figures?", 1
And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
done, 1
all, 1
that, 1
is, 1
possible,, 1
father,, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
this, 1
disastrous, 1
result?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
pause., 1
"I, 1
have,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
no, 1
money, 1
coming, 1
in, 1
on, 1
which, 1
you, 1
can, 1
rely?", 1
"None.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
exhausted, 1
every, 1
resource?", 1
"All.", 1
"And, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
voice,, 1
"our, 1
name, 1
is, 1
dishonored!", 1
"Blood, 1
washes, 1
out, 1
dishonor,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
father;, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
you.", 1
Then, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pistols,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"There, 1
is, 1
one, 1
for, 1
you, 1
and, 1
one, 1
for, 1
me--thanks!", 1
Morrel, 1
caught, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Your, 1
mother--your, 1
sister!, 1
Who, 1
will, 1
support, 1
them?", 1
A, 1
shudder, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
frame., 1
"Father,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
reflect, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
bidding, 1
me, 1
to, 1
live?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
so, 1
bid, 1
you,", 1
answered, 1
Morrel,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
your, 1
duty., 1
You, 1
have, 1
a, 1
calm,, 1
strong, 1
mind,, 1
Maximilian., 1
Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
no, 1
ordinary, 1
man., 1
I, 1
make, 1
no, 1
requests, 1
or, 1
commands;, 1
I, 1
only, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
my, 1
position, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
your, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
judge, 1
for, 1
yourself.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
reflected, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
then, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
sublime, 1
resignation, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
slow, 1
and, 1
sad, 1
gesture, 1
he, 1
took, 1
off, 1
his, 1
two, 1
epaulets,, 1
the, 1
insignia, 1
of, 1
his, 1
rank., 1
"Be, 1
it, 1
so,, 1
then,, 1
my, 1
father,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
"die, 1
in, 1
peace,, 1
my, 1
father;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
live.", 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
cast, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
before, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
but, 1
Maximilian, 1
caught, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
two, 1
noble, 1
hearts, 1
were, 1
pressed, 1
against, 1
each, 1
other, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
fault,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
Maximilian, 1
smiled., 1
"I, 1
know,, 1
father,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
most, 1
honorable, 1
man, 1
I, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
known.", 1
"Good,, 1
my, 1
son., 1
And, 1
now, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
more, 1
to, 1
be, 1
said;, 1
go, 1
and, 1
rejoin, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
sister.", 1
"My, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
bending, 1
his, 1
knee,, 1
"bless, 1
me!", 1
Morrel, 1
took, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son, 1
between, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands,, 1
drew, 1
him, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
kissing, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
several, 1
times, 1
said,, 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
bless, 1
you, 1
in, 1
my, 1
own, 1
name,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
three, 1
generations, 1
of, 1
irreproachable, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
say, 1
through, 1
me,, 1
'The, 1
edifice, 1
which, 1
misfortune, 1
has, 1
destroyed,, 1
providence, 1
may, 1
build, 1
up, 1
again.', 1
On, 1
seeing, 1
me, 1
die, 1
such, 1
a, 1
death,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
inexorable, 1
will, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
you., 1
To, 1
you,, 1
perhaps,, 1
they, 1
will, 1
accord, 1
the, 1
time, 1
they, 1
have, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
me., 1
Then, 1
do, 1
your, 1
best, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
our, 1
name, 1
free, 1
from, 1
dishonor., 1
Go, 1
to, 1
work,, 1
labor,, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
struggle, 1
ardently, 1
and, 1
courageously;, 1
live,, 1
yourself,, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
sister,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
rigid, 1
economy,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
from, 1
day, 1
to, 1
day, 1
the, 1
property, 1
of, 1
those, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hands, 1
may, 1
augment, 1
and, 1
fructify., 1
Reflect, 1
how, 1
glorious, 1
a, 1
day, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be,, 1
how, 1
grand,, 1
how, 1
solemn,, 1
that, 1
day, 1
of, 1
complete, 1
restoration,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
say, 1
in, 1
this, 1
very, 1
office,, 1
'My, 1
father, 1

this, 1

"My, 1
father,, 1
my, 1
father!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"why, 1
should, 1
you, 1

live?", 1
"If, 1

Living,, 1
my, 1
best, 1
friends, 1
would, 1
avoid, 1
my, 1
house;, 1
dead,, 1
all, 1
Marseilles, 1
will, 1
follow, 1
me, 1
in, 1
tears, 1
to, 1
my, 1
last, 1
home., 1
Living,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
feel, 1
shame, 1
at, 1
my, 1
name;, 1
dead,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
raise, 1
your, 1
head, 1
and, 1
say,, 1
'I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
him, 1
you, 1
killed,, 1
because,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
break, 1
his, 1
word.'", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
groan,, 1
but, 1
appeared, 1
resigned., 1
"And, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"leave, 1
me, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
sister, 1
away.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
my, 1
sister, 1
once, 1
more?", 1
asked, 1
Maximilian., 1
A, 1
last, 1
but, 1
final, 1
hope, 1
was, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
this, 1
interview,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
he, 1
had, 1
suggested, 1
it., 1
Morrel, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"I, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
bade, 1
her, 1
adieu.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
no, 1
particular, 1
commands, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
father?", 1
inquired, 1
Maximilian, 1
in, 1
a, 1
faltering, 1
voice., 1
"Yes;, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sacred, 1
command.", 1
"Say, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
"The, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1

the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
who,, 1
from, 1
humanity,, 1

it, 1
may, 1

"Father,, 1

said, 1
Maximilian., 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
adieu,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Go,, 1
leave, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
would, 1

alone., 1
You, 1
will, 1
find, 1

will, 1

the, 1
secretary, 1
in, 1
my, 1

The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
remained, 1
standing, 1
and, 1
motionless,, 1
having, 1
but, 1
the, 1
force, 1
of, 1
will, 1
and, 1
not, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
execution., 1
"Hear, 1
me,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
his, 1
father., 1
"Suppose, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
soldier, 1
like, 1
you,, 1

ordered, 1
to, 1

you, 1
said, 1
just, 1
now,, 1
'Go,, 1

for, 1
you, 1
are, 1
dishonored, 1
by, 1
delay,, 1
and, 1
death, 1

preferable, 1
to, 1
shame!'", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"yes;", 1
and, 1
once, 1
again, 1
embracing, 1
his, 1
father, 1
with, 1
convulsive, 1
pressure,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Be, 1
it, 1
so,, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
study., 1
When, 1
his, 1
son, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him,, 1
Morrel, 1
remained, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
standing, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
then, 1
putting, 1
forth, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
he, 1
pulled, 1
the, 1
bell., 1
After, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
interval,, 1
Cocles, 1
appeared., 1
It, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
the, 1
same, 1
man--the, 1
fearful, 1
revelations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
last, 1
days, 1
had, 1
crushed, 1
him., 1
This, 1
thought--the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
payment--bent, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
would, 1
otherwise, 1
have, 1
done., 1
"My, 1
worthy, 1
Cocles,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber., 1
When, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
who, 1
came, 1
three, 1
months, 1
ago--the, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French--arrives,, 1
announce, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Cocles, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply;, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
went, 1
into, 1
the, 1
anteroom,, 1
and, 1
seated, 1
himself., 1
Morrel, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
in, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
clock;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
seven, 1
minutes, 1
left,, 1
that, 1
was, 1
all., 1
The, 1
hand, 1
moved, 1
on, 1
with, 1
incredible, 1
rapidity,, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
see, 1
its, 1
motion., 1
What, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
this, 1
man, 1
at, 1
the, 1
supreme, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
agony, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
told, 1
in, 1
words., 1
He, 1
was, 1
still, 1
comparatively, 1
young,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
loving, 1
care, 1
of, 1
a, 1
devoted, 1
family,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
convinced, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
a, 1
course, 1
of, 1
reasoning,, 1
illogical, 1
perhaps,, 1
yet, 1
certainly, 1
plausible,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
must, 1
separate, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
all, 1
he, 1
held, 1
dear, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
even, 1
life, 1
itself., 1
To, 1
form, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
his, 1
feelings,, 1
one, 1
must, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
face, 1
with, 1
its, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
enforced, 1
resignation, 1
and, 1
its, 1
tear-moistened, 1
eyes, 1
raised, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
The, 1
minute, 1
hand, 1
moved, 1
on., 1
The, 1
pistols, 1
were, 1
loaded;, 1
he, 1
stretched, 1
forth, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
took, 1
one, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
murmured, 1
his, 1
daughter's, 1
name., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
laid, 1
it, 1
down, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
pen,, 1
and, 1
wrote, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
a, 1
sufficient, 1
farewell, 1
of, 1
his, 1
beloved, 1
daughter., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
again, 1
to, 1
the, 1
clock,, 1
counting, 1
time, 1
now, 1
not, 1
by, 1
minutes,, 1
but, 1
by, 1
seconds., 1
He, 1
took, 1
up, 1
the, 1
deadly, 1
weapon, 1
again,, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
parted, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
clock,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
click, 1
of, 1
the, 1
trigger, 1
as, 1
he, 1
cocked, 1
the, 1
pistol., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
mortal, 1
anguish, 1
the, 1
cold, 1
sweat, 1
came, 1
forth, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
a, 1
pang, 1
stronger, 1
than, 1
death, 1
clutched, 1
at, 1
his, 1
heart-strings., 1
He, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
creak, 1
on, 1
its, 1
hinges--the, 1
clock, 1
gave, 1
its, 1
warning, 1
to, 1
strike, 1
eleven--the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
study, 1
opened;, 1
Morrel, 1
did, 1
not, 1
turn, 1
round--he, 1
expected, 1
these, 1
words, 1
of, 1
Cocles,, 1
"The, 1
agent, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French.", 1
He, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
muzzle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pistol, 1
between, 1
his, 1
teeth., 1
Suddenly, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
cry--it, 1
was, 1
his, 1
daughter's, 1
voice., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Julie., 1
The, 1
pistol, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"My, 1
father!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
out, 1
of, 1
breath,, 1
and, 1
half, 1
dead, 1
with, 1
joy--"saved,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
saved!", 1
And, 1
she, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
her, 1
extended, 1
hand, 1
a, 1
red,, 1
netted, 1
silk, 1
purse., 1
"Saved,, 1
my, 1
child!", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"Yes,, 1
saved--saved!, 1
See,, 1
see!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
Morrel, 1
took, 1
the, 1
purse,, 1
and, 1
started, 1
as, 1
he, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
vague, 1
remembrance, 1
reminded, 1
him, 1
that, 1
it, 1
once, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
himself., 1
At, 1
one, 1
end, 1
was, 1
the, 1
receipted, 1
bill, 1
for, 1
the, 1
287,000, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
other, 1
was, 1
a, 1
diamond, 1
as, 1
large, 1
as, 1
a, 1
hazel-nut,, 1
with, 1
these, 1
words, 1
on, 1
a, 1
small, 1
slip, 1
of, 1
parchment:--Julie's, 1
Dowry., 1
Morrel, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
brow;, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
eleven., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
if, 1
each, 1
stroke, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hammer, 1
fell, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"Explain,, 1
my, 1
child,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Explain,, 1
my, 1
child,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"explain--where, 1
did, 1
you, 1
find, 1
this, 1
purse?", 1
"In, 1
a, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan,, 1
No., 1
15,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mantelpiece, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
floor.", 1
"But,", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
"this, 1
purse, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yours!", 1
Julie, 1
handed, 1
to, 1
her, 1
father, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
she, 1
had, 1
received, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
"And, 1
did, 1
you, 1
go, 1
alone?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
after, 1
he, 1
had, 1
read, 1
it., 1
"Emmanuel, 1
accompanied, 1
me,, 1
father., 1
He, 1
was, 1
to, 1
have, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
me, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Musee,, 1
but,, 1
strange, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
there, 1
when, 1
I, 1
returned.", 1
"Monsieur, 1
Morrel!", 1
exclaimed, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs.--"Monsieur, 1
Morrel!", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
his, 1
voice!", 1
said, 1
Julie., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Emmanuel, 1
entered,, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
full, 1
of, 1
animation, 1
and, 1
joy., 1
"The, 1
Pharaon!", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"the, 1
Pharaon!", 1
"What--what--the, 1
Pharaon!, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
mad,, 1
Emmanuel?, 1
You, 1
know, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
is, 1
lost.", 1
"The, 1
Pharaon,, 1
sir--they, 1
signal, 1
the, 1
Pharaon!, 1
The, 1
Pharaon, 1
is, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
harbor!", 1
Morrel, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
in, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
was, 1
failing, 1
him;, 1
his, 1
understanding, 1
weakened, 1
by, 1
such, 1
events,, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
such, 1
incredible,, 1
unheard-of,, 1
fabulous, 1
facts., 1
But, 1
his, 1
son, 1
came, 1
in., 1
"Father,", 1
cried, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"how, 1
could, 1
you, 1
say, 1
the, 1
Pharaon, 1
was, 1
lost?, 1
The, 1
lookout, 1
has, 1
signalled, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
say, 1
she, 1
is, 1
now, 1
coming, 1
into, 1
port.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
friends,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"if, 1
this, 1
be, 1
so,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
miracle, 1
of, 1
heaven!, 1
Impossible,, 1
impossible!", 1
But, 1
what, 1
was, 1
real, 1
and, 1
not, 1
less, 1
incredible, 1
was, 1
the, 1
purse, 1
he, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
acceptance, 1
receipted--the, 1
splendid, 1
diamond., 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Cocles,, 1
"what, 1
can, 1
it, 1
mean?--the, 1
Pharaon?", 1
"Come,, 1
dear, 1
ones,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
rising, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see,, 1
and, 1
heaven, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
upon, 1
us, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
false, 1
intelligence!", 1
They, 1
all, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
met, 1
Madame, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
afraid, 1
to, 1
go, 1
up, 1
into, 1
the, 1
study., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Cannebiere., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pier., 1
All, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
before, 1
Morrel., 1
"The, 1
Pharaon,, 1
the, 1
Pharaon!", 1
said, 1
every, 1
voice., 1
And,, 1
wonderful, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tower, 1
of, 1
Saint-Jean,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
ship, 1
bearing, 1
on, 1
her, 1
stern, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
printed, 1
in, 1
white, 1
letters,, 1
"The, 1
Pharaon,, 1
Morrel, 1
&, 1
Son,, 1
of, 1
Marseilles.", 1
She, 1
was, 1
the, 1
exact, 1
duplicate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other, 1
Pharaon,, 1
and, 1
loaded,, 1
as, 1
that, 1

To, 1

there, 1
was, 1
the, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1

and, 1
ten, 1
thousand, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
came, 1
to, 1
corroborate, 1
the, 1
testimony., 1
As, 1
Morrel, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son, 1
embraced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pier-head,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
and, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
applause, 1
of, 1

whole, 1

witnessing, 1
this, 1

a, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
face, 1
half-covered, 1
by, 1
a, 1
black, 1
beard,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
concealed, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
sentry-box,, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
with, 1
delight,, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone:, 1
"Be, 1
happy,, 1
noble, 1
heart,, 1

And, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
expressive, 1
of, 1
supreme, 1
content,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his, 1
hiding-place,, 1

without, 1

observed,, 1
descended, 1
one, 1
of, 1

flights, 1
of, 1
steps, 1
provided, 1
for, 1
debarkation,, 1
and, 1
hailing, 1
three, 1
times,, 1
shouted, 1
"Jacopo,, 1
Jacopo,, 1
Jacopo!", 1
Then, 1
a, 1
launch, 1
came, 1
to, 1
shore,, 1
took, 1
him, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
a, 1
yacht, 1
splendidly, 1
fitted, 1
up,, 1
on, 1
whose, 1
deck, 1
he, 1
sprung, 1
with, 1
the, 1
activity, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sailor;, 1
thence, 1
he, 1
once, 1
again, 1
looked, 1
towards, 1
Morrel,, 1
who,, 1
weeping, 1
with, 1
joy,, 1
was, 1
shaking, 1
hands, 1
most, 1
cordially, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
thanking, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
benefactor, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seeking, 1
in, 1

"And, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
unknown,, 1
"farewell, 1

to, 1

wicked!", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
signal,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
only, 1
awaiting, 1
this, 1
signal,, 1

yacht, 1
instantly, 1
put, 1

Towards, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1

1838,, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
belonging, 1

the, 1
Vicomte, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1

the, 1
Baron, 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
were, 1
at, 1
Florence., 1
They, 1
had, 1
agreed, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
that, 1
year,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
years, 1
had, 1
inhabited, 1
Italy,, 1
should, 1
act, 1
as, 1
cicerone, 1
to, 1
Albert., 1
As, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
inconsiderable, 1
affair, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
great, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1

the, 1
proprietor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres,, 1

to, 1
reserve, 1

for, 1
them., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
replied, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
two, 1
rooms, 1
and, 1
a, 1
parlor, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third, 1
floor,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
low, 1
charge, 1
of, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
per, 1
diem., 1
They, 1
accepted, 1
his, 1
offer;, 1
but, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
best, 1
use, 1
of, 1
the, 1
time, 1
that, 1
was, 1
left,, 1
Albert, 1
started, 1
for, 1
Naples., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Franz,, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
at, 1
Florence,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days, 1
in, 1
exploring, 1
the, 1
paradise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cascine,, 1
and, 1
spending, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
evenings, 1
at, 1
the, 1
houses, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Florentine, 1
nobility,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
into, 1
his, 1
head, 1
(having, 1
already, 1
visited, 1
Corsica,, 1
the, 1
cradle, 1
of, 1
Bonaparte), 1
to, 1
visit, 1
Elba,, 1
the, 1
waiting-place, 1
of, 1
Napoleon., 1
One, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
off, 1
the, 1
painter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sailboat, 1
from, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
ring, 1
that, 1
secured, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dock, 1
at, 1
Leghorn,, 1
wrapped, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
coat, 1
and, 1
lay, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crew,--"To, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba!", 1
The, 1
boat, 1
shot, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
harbor, 1
like, 1
a, 1
bird, 1
and, 1
the, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
Franz, 1
disembarked, 1
at, 1
Porto-Ferrajo., 1
He, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
traces, 1
which, 1
the, 1
footsteps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
giant, 1
have, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
re-embarked, 1
for, 1
Marciana., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
after, 1
he, 1
again, 1
landed, 1
at, 1
Pianosa,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
red, 1
partridges, 1
abounded., 1
The, 1
sport, 1
was, 1
bad;, 1
Franz, 1
only, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
killing, 1
a, 1
few, 1
partridges,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
every, 1
unsuccessful, 1
sportsman,, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
very, 1
much, 1
out, 1
of, 1
temper., 1
"Ah,, 1
if, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
chose,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"you, 1
might, 1
have, 1
capital, 1
sport.", 1
"Where?", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
see, 1
that, 1
island?", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
a, 1
conical, 1
pile, 1
rising, 1
from, 1
the, 1
indigo, 1
sea., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
this, 1
island?", 1
"The, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
shoot, 1
over, 1
this, 1
island.", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
does, 1
not, 1
require, 1
a, 1
permit,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
island, 1
is, 1
uninhabited.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"A, 1
desert, 1
island, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
curiosity.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
natural;, 1

"To, 1
whom, 1
does, 1
this, 1
island, 1
belong?", 1
"To, 1
Tuscany.", 1
"What, 1
game, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
find, 1
there!", 1
"Thousands, 1
of, 1
wild, 1
goats.", 1
"Who, 1
live, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
stones,, 1
I, 1
suppose,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
an, 1
incredulous, 1
smile., 1
"No,, 1
but, 1
by, 1
browsing, 1
the, 1
shrubs, 1
and, 1
trees, 1
that, 1
grow, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crevices, 1
of, 1

"Where, 1
can, 1
I, 1
sleep?", 1
"On, 1
shore, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grottos,, 1

on, 1
board, 1
in, 1
your, 1
cloak;, 1
besides,, 1

your, 1

well, 1
by, 1
night, 1

by, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
drops, 1
we, 1
can, 1
use, 1
our, 1
oars.", 1
As, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
sufficient, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
apartments, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
were, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
available,, 1
he, 1
accepted, 1
the, 1
proposition., 1
Upon, 1
his, 1
answer, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative,, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
together, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1

"what, 1

there, 1
any, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
the, 1
way?", 1
"No.", 1

cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Nor, 1
I,, 1
nor, 1
I,", 1
chorused, 1
the, 1
sailors., 1
"Then, 1
steer, 1
for, 1

captain, 1
gave, 1

why?", 1
"Because,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
they, 1
transfer, 1
from, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
to, 1
their, 1
own, 1
boat, 1
whatever, 1
they, 1
think, 1
worth, 1
taking,, 1
then, 1
they, 1
bind, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
foot,, 1
they, 1
attach, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one's, 1
neck, 1
a, 1
four, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
pound, 1
ball,, 1
a, 1
large, 1
hole, 1
is, 1
chopped, 1
in, 1
the, 1
vessel's, 1
bottom,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
they, 1
leave, 1
her., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
begins, 1
to, 1
roll, 1
heavily, 1
and, 1
settle, 1
down., 1
First, 1
one, 1
gun'l, 1
goes, 1
under,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
other., 1
Then, 1
they, 1
lift, 1
and, 1
sink, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
both, 1
go, 1
under, 1
at, 1
once., 1
All, 1
at, 1
once, 1
there's, 1
a, 1
noise, 1
like, 1
a, 1
cannon--that's, 1
the, 1
air, 1
blowing, 1
up, 1
the, 1
deck., 1
Soon, 1
the, 1
water, 1
rushes, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scupper-holes, 1
like, 1
a, 1
whale, 1
spouting,, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
gives, 1
a, 1
last, 1
groan,, 1
spins, 1
round, 1
and, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
disappears,, 1
forming, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
whirlpool, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
all, 1
is, 1
over,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
in, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
God, 1
can, 1
see, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
where, 1
she, 1
lies, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"why, 1
no, 1
complaints, 1
are, 1
made, 1
to, 1
the, 1
government,, 1
and, 1
why, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
never, 1
reaches, 1
port?", 1
It, 1
is, 1
probable, 1
that, 1
if, 1
Gaetano, 1
had, 1
related, 1
this, 1
previous, 1
to, 1
proposing, 1
the, 1
expedition,, 1
Franz, 1
would, 1
have, 1
hesitated,, 1
but, 1
now, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
started,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
cowardly, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
back., 1
He, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
men, 1
who, 1
do, 1
not, 1
rashly, 1
court, 1
danger,, 1
but, 1
if, 1
danger, 1
presents, 1
itself,, 1
combat, 1
it, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
unalterable, 1
coolness., 1
Calm, 1
and, 1
resolute,, 1
he, 1
treated, 1
any, 1
peril, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
an, 1
adversary, 1
in, 1
a, 1
duel,--calculated, 1
its, 1
probable, 1
method, 1
of, 1
approach;, 1
retreated,, 1
if, 1
at, 1
all,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
point, 1
of, 1
strategy, 1
and, 1
not, 1
from, 1
cowardice;, 1
was, 1
quick, 1
to, 1
see, 1
an, 1
opening, 1
for, 1
attack,, 1
and, 1
won, 1
victory, 1
at, 1
a, 1
single, 1
thrust., 1
"Bah!", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
travelled, 1
through, 1
Sicily, 1
and, 1
Calabria--I, 1
have, 1
sailed, 1
two, 1
months, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Archipelago,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
never, 1
saw, 1
even, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bandit, 1
or, 1
a, 1
pirate.", 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
this, 1
to, 1
deter, 1
you, 1
from, 1
your, 1
project,", 1
replied, 1
Gaetano,, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
questioned, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
answered;, 1
that's, 1
all.", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
conversation, 1
is, 1
most, 1
interesting;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
enjoy, 1
it, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
steer, 1
for, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
The, 1
wind, 1
blew, 1
strongly,, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
made, 1
six, 1
or, 1
seven, 1
knots, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
were, 1
rapidly, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
their, 1
voyage., 1
As, 1
they, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
the, 1
island, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
lift, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
air, 1
was, 1
so, 1
clear, 1
that, 1
they, 1
could, 1
already, 1
distinguish, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
heaped, 1
on, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
like, 1
cannon, 1
balls, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arsenal,, 1
with, 1
green, 1
bushes, 1
and, 1
trees, 1
growing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
crevices., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
although, 1
they, 1
appeared, 1
perfectly, 1
tranquil, 1
yet, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
alert,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
they, 1
carefully, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
glassy, 1
surface, 1
over, 1
which, 1
they, 1
were, 1
sailing,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
which, 1
a, 1
few, 1
fishing-boats,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
white, 1
sails,, 1
were, 1
alone, 1
visible., 1
They, 1
were, 1
within, 1
fifteen, 1
miles, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
began, 1
to, 1
set, 1
behind, 1
Corsica,, 1
whose, 1
mountains, 1
appeared, 1
against, 1
the, 1
sky,, 1
showing, 1
their, 1
rugged, 1
peaks, 1
in, 1
bold, 1
relief;, 1
this, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
rock,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
giant, 1
Adamastor,, 1
rose, 1
dead, 1
ahead,, 1
a, 1
formidable, 1
barrier,, 1
and, 1
intercepting, 1
the, 1
light, 1
that, 1
gilded, 1
its, 1
massive, 1
peaks, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
voyagers, 1
were, 1
in, 1
shadow., 1
Little, 1
by, 1
little, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
rose, 1
higher, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
before, 1
it, 1
the, 1
last, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
expiring, 1
day;, 1
at, 1
last, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mountain,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
paused, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
fiery, 1
crest, 1
of, 1
a, 1
volcano,, 1
then, 1
gloom, 1
gradually, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
as, 1
it, 1
had, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
base,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
island, 1
now, 1
only, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
gray, 1
mountain, 1
that, 1
grew, 1
continually, 1
darker;, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
after,, 1
the, 1
night, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
dark., 1
Fortunately,, 1
the, 1
mariners, 1
were, 1
used, 1
to, 1
these, 1
latitudes,, 1
and, 1
knew, 1
every, 1
rock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Tuscan, 1
Archipelago;, 1
for, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
this, 1
obscurity, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
not, 1
without, 1
uneasiness--Corsica, 1
had, 1
long, 1
since, 1
disappeared,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
itself, 1
was, 1
invisible;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
seemed,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
lynx,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pilot, 1
who, 1
steered, 1
did, 1
not, 1
evince, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
hesitation., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
since, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
had, 1
set,, 1
when, 1
Franz, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
saw,, 1
at, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mile, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
mass,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
precisely, 1
make, 1
out, 1
what, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
and, 1
fearing, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
the, 1
mirth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
by, 1
mistaking, 1
a, 1
floating, 1
cloud, 1
for, 1
land,, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
silent;, 1
suddenly, 1
a, 1
great, 1
light, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
strand;, 1
land, 1
might, 1
resemble, 1
a, 1
cloud,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
meteor., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
this, 1
light?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"Hush!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fire.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
the, 1
island, 1
was, 1
uninhabited?", 1
"I, 1
said, 1
there, 1
were, 1
no, 1
fixed, 1
habitations, 1
on, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
said, 1
also, 1
that, 1
it, 1
served, 1
sometimes, 1
as, 1
a, 1
harbor, 1
for, 1
smugglers.", 1
"And, 1
for, 1
pirates?", 1
"And, 1
for, 1
pirates,", 1
returned, 1
Gaetano,, 1
repeating, 1
Franz's, 1
words., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
for, 1
that, 1
reason, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
for,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
is, 1
behind, 1
us.", 1
"But, 1
this, 1
fire?", 1
continued, 1
Franz., 1
"It, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
rather, 1
reassuring, 1
than, 1
otherwise;, 1
men, 1
who, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
would, 1
not, 1
light, 1
a, 1
fire.", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
goes, 1
for, 1
nothing,", 1
said, 1
Gaetano., 1
"If, 1
you, 1
can, 1
guess, 1
the, 1
position, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
that, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
from, 1
the, 1
side, 1
or, 1
from, 1
Pianosa,, 1
but, 1
only, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sea.", 1
"You, 1
think,, 1
then,, 1
this, 1
fire, 1
indicates, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
unpleasant, 1
neighbors?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
what, 1
we, 1
must, 1
find, 1
out,", 1
returned, 1
Gaetano,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
this, 1
terrestrial, 1
star., 1
"How, 1
can, 1
you, 1
find, 1
out?", 1
"You, 1
shall, 1
see.", 1
Gaetano, 1
consulted, 1
with, 1
his, 1
companions,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
five, 1
minutes', 1
discussion, 1
a, 1
manoeuvre, 1
was, 1
executed, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
to, 1
tack, 1
about,, 1
they, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
way, 1
they, 1
had, 1
come,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
disappeared,, 1
hidden, 1
by, 1
an, 1
elevation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
land., 1
The, 1
pilot, 1
again, 1
changed, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
which, 1
rapidly, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
within, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
of, 1
it., 1
Gaetano, 1
lowered, 1
the, 1
sail,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
came, 1
to, 1
rest., 1
All, 1
this, 1
was, 1
done, 1
in, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
their, 1
course, 1
was, 1
changed, 1
not, 1
a, 1
word, 1
was, 1
spoken., 1
Gaetano,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
proposed, 1
the, 1
expedition,, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
all, 1
the, 1
responsibility, 1
on, 1
himself;, 1
the, 1
four, 1
sailors, 1
fixed, 1
their, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
while, 1
they, 1
got, 1
out, 1
their, 1
oars, 1
and, 1
held, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
readiness, 1
to, 1
row, 1
away,, 1
which,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
difficult., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Franz,, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
coolness;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
two, 1
double-barrelled, 1
guns, 1
and, 1
a, 1
rifle;, 1
he, 1
loaded, 1
them,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
priming,, 1
and, 1
waited, 1
quietly., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
off, 1
his, 1
vest, 1
and, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
secured, 1
his, 1
trousers, 1
round, 1
his, 1
waist;, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
were, 1
naked,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
shoes, 1
and, 1
stockings, 1
to, 1
take, 1
off;, 1
after, 1
these, 1
preparations, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
lowering, 1
himself, 1
noiselessly, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
swam, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
shore, 1
with, 1
such, 1
precaution, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
sound;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
only, 1
be, 1
traced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
phosphorescent, 1
line, 1
in, 1
his, 1
wake., 1
This, 1
track, 1
soon, 1
disappeared;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
shore., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
on, 1
board, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
for, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
same, 1
luminous, 1
track, 1
was, 1
again, 1
observed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
swimmer, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
on, 1
board., 1
"Well?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
in, 1
unison., 1
"They, 1
are, 1
Spanish, 1
smugglers,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"they, 1
have, 1
with, 1
them, 1
two, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
are, 1
these, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits, 1
doing, 1
here, 1
with, 1
Spanish, 1
smugglers?", 1
"Alas,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
with, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
pity,, 1
"we, 1
ought, 1
always, 1
to, 1
help, 1
one, 1
another., 1
Very, 1
often, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
are, 1
hard, 1
pressed, 1
by, 1
gendarmes, 1
or, 1
carbineers;, 1
well,, 1
they, 1
see, 1
a, 1
vessel,, 1
and, 1
good, 1
fellows, 1
like, 1
us, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
they, 1
come, 1
and, 1
demand, 1
hospitality, 1
of, 1
us;, 1
you, 1
can't, 1
refuse, 1
help, 1
to, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
hunted, 1
devil;, 1
we, 1
receive, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
greater, 1
security, 1
we, 1
stand, 1
out, 1
to, 1
sea., 1
This, 1
costs, 1
us, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
saves, 1
the, 1
life,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
the, 1
liberty,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fellow-creature,, 1
who, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
occasion, 1
returns, 1
the, 1
service, 1
by, 1
pointing, 1
out, 1
some, 1
safe, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
we, 1
can, 1
land, 1
our, 1
goods, 1
without, 1
interruption.", 1
"Ah!", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"then, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
smuggler, 1
occasionally,, 1
Gaetano?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
live, 1
somehow,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
smiling, 1
impenetrably., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
men, 1
who, 1
are, 1
now, 1
on, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
we, 1
sailors, 1
are, 1
like, 1
freemasons,, 1
and, 1
recognize, 1
each, 1
other, 1
by, 1
signs.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
we, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
if, 1
we, 1
land?", 1
"Nothing, 1
at, 1
all;, 1
smugglers, 1
are, 1
not, 1
thieves.", 1
"But, 1
these, 1
two, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits?", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
calculating, 1
the, 1
chances, 1
of, 1
peril., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
their, 1
fault, 1
that, 1
they, 1
are, 1
bandits,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
authorities.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"Because, 1
they, 1
are, 1
pursued, 1
for, 1
having, 1
made, 1
a, 1
stiff,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
a, 1
Corsican's, 1
nature, 1
to, 1
revenge, 1
himself.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
having, 1
made, 1
a, 1
stiff?--having, 1
assassinated, 1
a, 1
man?", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
continuing, 1
his, 1
investigation., 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
they, 1
have, 1
killed, 1
an, 1
enemy,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
a, 1
very, 1
different, 1
thing,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
demand, 1
hospitality, 1
of, 1
these, 1
smugglers, 1
and, 1
bandits., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
they, 1
will, 1
grant, 1
it?", 1
"Without, 1
doubt.", 1
"How, 1
many, 1
are, 1
they?", 1
"Four,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
bandits, 1
make, 1
six.", 1
"Just, 1
our, 1
number,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
if, 1
they, 1
prove, 1
troublesome,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
them, 1
in, 1
check;, 1
so,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
time,, 1
steer, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
permit, 1
us, 1
to, 1
take, 1
all, 1
due, 1
precautions.", 1
"By, 1
all, 1
means,, 1
be, 1
as, 1
wise, 1
as, 1
Nestor, 1
and, 1
as, 1
prudent, 1
as, 1
Ulysses;, 1
I, 1
do, 1
more, 1
than, 1
permit,, 1
I, 1
exhort, 1
you.", 1
"Silence,, 1
then!", 1
said, 1
Gaetano., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
obeyed., 1
For, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
like, 1
Franz,, 1
viewed, 1
his, 1
position, 1
in, 1
its, 1
true, 1
light,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
grave, 1
one., 1
He, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
with, 1
sailors, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
be, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
several, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
his, 1
belt,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
often, 1
examined, 1
his, 1
weapons,--which, 1
were, 1
very, 1
beautiful,--if, 1
not, 1
with, 1
envy,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
with, 1
curiosity., 1
On, 1
the, 1
other, 1
hand,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
land,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
other, 1
escort, 1
than, 1
these, 1
men,, 1
on, 1
an, 1
island, 1
which, 1
had,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
very, 1
religious, 1
name,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
afford, 1
him, 1
much, 1
hospitality,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
and, 1
bandits., 1
The, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scuttled, 1
vessels,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
appeared, 1
improbable, 1
during, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
seemed, 1
very, 1
probable, 1
at, 1
night;, 1
placed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
between, 1
two, 1
possible, 1
sources, 1
of, 1
danger,, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
on, 1
the, 1
crew,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
gun, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
sailors, 1
had, 1
again, 1
hoisted, 1
sail,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
once, 1
more, 1
cleaving, 1
the, 1
waves., 1
Through, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
Franz,, 1
whose, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
now, 1
more, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
looming, 1
shore, 1
along, 1
which, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
sailing,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
rounded, 1
a, 1
rocky, 1
point,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
more, 1
brilliant, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
and, 1
about, 1
it, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
persons, 1
seated., 1
The, 1
blaze, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
for, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
paces, 1
around., 1
Gaetano, 1
skirted, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
carefully, 1
keeping, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow;, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
he, 1
steered, 1
to, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circle,, 1
singing, 1
a, 1
fishing, 1
song,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
his, 1
companions, 1
sung, 1
the, 1
chorus., 1
At, 1
the, 1
first, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
song, 1
the, 1
men, 1
seated, 1
round, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
landing-place,, 1
their, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
evidently, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
know, 1
who, 1
the, 1
new-comers, 1
were, 1
and, 1
what, 1
were, 1
their, 1
intentions., 1
They, 1
soon, 1
appeared, 1
satisfied, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
(with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
one,, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
at, 1
the, 1
shore), 1
to, 1
their, 1
fire,, 1
at, 1
which, 1
the, 1
carcass, 1
of, 1
a, 1
goat, 1
was, 1
roasting., 1
When, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
within, 1
twenty, 1
paces, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
on, 1
the, 1
beach,, 1
who, 1
carried, 1
a, 1
carbine,, 1
presented, 1
arms, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sentinel,, 1
and, 1
cried,, 1
"Who, 1
comes, 1
there?", 1
in, 1
Sardinian., 1
Franz, 1
coolly, 1
cocked, 1
both, 1
barrels., 1
Gaetano, 1
then, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
with, 1
this, 1
man, 1
which, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
did, 1
not, 1
understand,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
evidently, 1
concerned, 1
him., 1
"Will, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
give, 1
your, 1
name,, 1
or, 1
remain, 1
incognito?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
captain., 1
"My, 1
name, 1
must, 1
rest, 1
unknown,--merely, 1
say, 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
Frenchman, 1
travelling, 1
for, 1
pleasure.", 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
Gaetano, 1
had, 1
transmitted, 1
this, 1
answer,, 1
the, 1
sentinel, 1
gave, 1
an, 1
order, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
men, 1
seated, 1
round, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
who, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
disappeared, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rocks., 1
Not, 1
a, 1
word, 1
was, 1
spoken,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
seemed, 1
occupied,, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
his, 1
disembarkment,, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
with, 1
their, 1
sails,, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
with, 1
their, 1
goat;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
carelessness, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
they, 1
mutually, 1
observed, 1
each, 1
other., 1
The, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
disappeared, 1
returned, 1
suddenly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side, 1
to, 1
that, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left;, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sentinel,, 1
who,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
said,, 1
"S'accommodi.", 1
The, 1
Italian, 1
s'accommodi, 1
is, 1
untranslatable;, 1
it, 1
means, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
"Come,, 1
enter,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
welcome;, 1
make, 1
yourself, 1
at, 1
home;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
master.", 1
It, 1
is, 1
like, 1
that, 1
Turkish, 1
phrase, 1
of, 1
Moliere's, 1
that, 1
so, 1
astonished, 1
the, 1
bourgeois, 1
gentleman, 1
by, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
things, 1
implied, 1
in, 1
its, 1
utterance., 1
The, 1
sailors, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
a, 1
second, 1
invitation;, 1
four, 1
strokes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oar, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
to, 1
land;, 1
Gaetano, 1
sprang, 1
to, 1
shore,, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sentinel,, 1
then, 1
his, 1
comrades, 1
disembarked,, 1
and, 1
lastly, 1
came, 1
Franz., 1
One, 1
of, 1
his, 1
guns, 1
was, 1
swung, 1
over, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
Gaetano, 1
had, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
held, 1
his, 1
rifle;, 1
his, 1
dress,, 1
half, 1
artist,, 1
half, 1
dandy,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
excite, 1
any, 1
suspicion,, 1
and,, 1
consequently,, 1
no, 1
disquietude., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
moored, 1
to, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
advanced, 1
a, 1
few, 1
paces, 1
to, 1
find, 1
a, 1
comfortable, 1
bivouac;, 1
but,, 1
doubtless,, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
they, 1
chose, 1
did, 1
not, 1
suit, 1
the, 1
smuggler, 1
who, 1
filled, 1
the, 1
post, 1
of, 1
sentinel,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
cried, 1
out,, 1
"Not, 1
that, 1
way,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
Gaetano, 1
faltered, 1
an, 1
excuse,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side,, 1
while, 1
two, 1
sailors, 1
kindled, 1
torches, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
to, 1
light, 1
them, 1
on, 1
their, 1
way., 1
They, 1
advanced, 1
about, 1
thirty, 1
paces,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
a, 1
small, 1
esplanade, 1
surrounded, 1
with, 1
rocks,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
seats, 1
had, 1
been, 1
cut,, 1
not, 1
unlike, 1
sentry-boxes., 1
Around, 1
in, 1
the, 1
crevices, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
grew, 1
a, 1
few, 1
dwarf, 1
oaks, 1
and, 1
thick, 1
bushes, 1
of, 1
myrtles., 1
Franz, 1
lowered, 1
a, 1
torch,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
by, 1
the, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
cinders, 1
that, 1
had, 1
accumulated, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
this, 1
retreat,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
doubtless,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
halting-places, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wandering, 1
visitors, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
As, 1
for, 1
his, 1
suspicions,, 1
once, 1
on, 1
terra, 1
firma,, 1
once, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
indifferent,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
friendly,, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hosts,, 1
his, 1
anxiety, 1
had, 1
quite, 1
disappeared,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
at, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
goat,, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
appetite., 1
He, 1
mentioned, 1
this, 1
to, 1
Gaetano,, 1
who, 1
replied, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
could, 1
be, 1
more, 1
easy, 1
than, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
a, 1
supper, 1
when, 1
they, 1
had, 1
in, 1
their, 1
boat,, 1
bread,, 1
wine,, 1
half, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
partridges,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
good, 1
fire, 1
to, 1
roast, 1
them, 1
by., 1
"Besides,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
"if, 1
the, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
their, 1
roast, 1
meat, 1
tempts, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
offer, 1
them, 1
two, 1
of, 1
our, 1
birds, 1
for, 1
a, 1
slice.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
born, 1
diplomat,", 1
returned, 1
Franz;, 1
"go, 1
and, 1
try.", 1
Meanwhile, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
had, 1
collected, 1
dried, 1
sticks, 1
and, 1
branches, 1
with, 1
which, 1
they, 1
made, 1
a, 1
fire., 1
Franz, 1
waited, 1
impatiently,, 1
inhaling, 1
the, 1
aroma, 1
of, 1
the, 1
roasted, 1
meat,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
air., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"anything, 1
new?--do, 1
they, 1
refuse?", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,", 1
returned, 1
Gaetano,, 1
"the, 1
chief,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
told, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
young, 1
Frenchman,, 1
invites, 1
you, 1
to, 1
sup, 1
with, 1
him.", 1
"Well,", 1
observed, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
chief, 1
is, 1
very, 1
polite,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
see, 1
no, 1
objection--the, 1
more, 1
so, 1
as, 1
I, 1
bring, 1
my, 1
share, 1
of, 1
the, 1
supper.", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
that;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
plenty,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
spare,, 1
for, 1
supper;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
makes, 1
one, 1
condition,, 1
and, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
peculiar, 1
one,, 1
before, 1
he, 1
will, 1
receive, 1
you, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house.", 1
"His, 1
house?, 1
Has, 1
he, 1
built, 1
one, 1
here,, 1
then?", 1
"No;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
very, 1
comfortable, 1
one, 1
all, 1
the, 1
same,, 1
so, 1
they, 1
say.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
this, 1
chief,, 1
then?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
him.", 1
"Favorably, 1
or, 1
otherwise?", 1
"Both.", 1
"The, 1
deuce!--and, 1
what, 1
is, 1
this, 1
condition?", 1
"That, 1
you, 1
are, 1
blindfolded,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
take, 1
off, 1
the, 1
bandage, 1
until, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
bids, 1
you.", 1
Franz, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Gaetano,, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
if, 1
possible,, 1
what, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
this, 1
proposal., 1
"Ah,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
guessing, 1
Franz's, 1
thought,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
matter.", 1
"What, 1
should, 1
you, 1
do, 1
in, 1
my, 1
place?", 1
"I,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
lose,--I, 1
should, 1
go.", 1
"You, 1
would, 1
accept?", 1
"Yes,, 1
were, 1
it, 1
only, 1
out, 1
of, 1
curiosity.", 1
"There, 1
is, 1
something, 1
very, 1
peculiar, 1
about, 1
this, 1
chief,, 1
then?", 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
Gaetano,, 1
lowering, 1
his, 1
voice,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
if, 1
what, 1
they, 1
say, 1
is, 1
true"--he, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
any, 1
one, 1
was, 1
near., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
they, 1
say?", 1
"That, 1
this, 1
chief, 1
inhabits, 1
a, 1
cavern, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Pitti, 1
Palace, 1
is, 1
nothing.", 1
"What, 1
nonsense!", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
reseating, 1
himself., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
no, 1
nonsense;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
true., 1
Cama,, 1
the, 1
pilot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Saint, 1
Ferdinand,, 1
went, 1
in, 1
once,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
came, 1
back, 1
amazed,, 1
vowing, 1
that, 1
such, 1
treasures, 1
were, 1
only, 1
to, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
in, 1
fairy, 1
tales.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,", 1
observed, 1
Franz,, 1
"that, 1
with, 1
such, 1
stories, 1
you, 1
make, 1
me, 1
think, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Baba's, 1
enchanted, 1
cavern?", 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
told.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
advise, 1
me, 1
to, 1
accept?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
say, 1
that;, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
advise, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
matter.", 1
Franz, 1
pondered, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments,, 1
concluded, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
so, 1
rich, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
any, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
plundering, 1
him, 1
of, 1
what, 1
little, 1
he, 1
had,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
only, 1
the, 1
prospect, 1
of, 1
a, 1
good, 1
supper,, 1
accepted., 1
Gaetano, 1
departed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
reply., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
prudent,, 1
and, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
all, 1
he, 1
possibly, 1
could, 1
concerning, 1
his, 1
host., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
sailor,, 1
who,, 1
during, 1
this, 1
dialogue,, 1
had, 1
sat, 1
gravely, 1
plucking, 1
the, 1
partridges, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
proud, 1
of, 1
his, 1
office,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
him, 1
how, 1
these, 1
men, 1
had, 1
landed,, 1
as, 1
no, 1
vessel, 1
of, 1
any, 1
kind, 1
was, 1
visible., 1
"Never, 1
mind, 1
that,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
sailor,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
their, 1
vessel.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
a, 1
very, 1
beautiful, 1
vessel?", 1
"I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
a, 1
better, 1
to, 1
sail, 1
round, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Of, 1
what, 1
burden, 1
is, 1
she?", 1
"About, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
tons;, 1
but, 1
she, 1
is, 1
built, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
any, 1
weather., 1
She, 1
is, 1
what, 1
the, 1
English, 1
call, 1
a, 1
yacht.", 1
"Where, 1
was, 1
she, 1
built?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
not;, 1
but, 1
my, 1
own, 1
opinion, 1
is, 1
she, 1
is, 1
a, 1
Genoese.", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
did, 1
a, 1
leader, 1
of, 1
smugglers,", 1
continued, 1
Franz,, 1
"venture, 1
to, 1
build, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
designed, 1
for, 1
such, 1
a, 1
purpose, 1
at, 1
Genoa?", 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
was, 1
a, 1
smuggler,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
sailor., 1
"No;, 1
but, 1
Gaetano, 1
did,, 1
I, 1
thought.", 1
"Gaetano, 1
had, 1
only, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
from, 1
a, 1
distance,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
then, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one.", 1
"And, 1
if, 1
this, 1
person, 1
be, 1
not, 1
a, 1
smuggler,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"A, 1
wealthy, 1
signor,, 1
who, 1
travels, 1
for, 1
his, 1
pleasure.", 1
"Come,", 1
thought, 1
Franz,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
still, 1
more, 1
mysterious,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
two, 1
accounts, 1
do, 1
not, 1
agree.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
him, 1
he, 1
says, 1
Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
his, 1
real, 1
name.", 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
where, 1
does, 1
he, 1
reside?", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
sea.", 1
"What, 1
country, 1
does, 1
he, 1
come, 1
from?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
him?", 1
"Sometimes.", 1
"What, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
judge, 1
for, 1
yourself.", 1
"Where, 1
will, 1
he, 1
receive, 1
me?", 1
"No, 1
doubt, 1
in, 1
the, 1
subterranean, 1
palace, 1
Gaetano, 1
told, 1
you, 1
of.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
never, 1
had, 1
the, 1
curiosity,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
landed, 1
and, 1
found, 1
this, 1
island, 1
deserted,, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
for, 1
this, 1
enchanted, 1
palace?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once,, 1
but, 1
always, 1
in, 1
vain;, 1
we, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
all, 1
over,, 1
but, 1
we, 1
never, 1
could, 1
find, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
any, 1
opening;, 1
they, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
door, 1
is, 1
not, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
a, 1
key,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
magic, 1
word.", 1
"Decidedly,", 1
muttered, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
an, 1
Arabian, 1
Nights', 1
adventure.", 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
waits, 1
for, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
voice,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
recognized, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sentinel., 1
He, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yacht's, 1
crew., 1
Franz, 1
drew, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
they, 1
bandaged, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
a, 1
care, 1
that, 1
showed, 1
their, 1
apprehensions, 1
of, 1
his, 1
committing, 1
some, 1
indiscretion., 1
Afterwards, 1
he, 1
was, 1
made, 1
to, 1
promise, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
make, 1
the, 1
least, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
the, 1
bandage., 1
He, 1
promised., 1
Then, 1
his, 1
two, 1
guides, 1
took, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on,, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sentinel., 1
After, 1
going, 1
about, 1
thirty, 1
paces,, 1
he, 1
smelt, 1
the, 1
appetizing, 1
odor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kid, 1
that, 1
was, 1
roasting,, 1
and, 1
knew, 1
thus, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
bivouac;, 1
they, 1
then, 1
led, 1
him, 1
on, 1
about, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
farther,, 1
evidently, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shore, 1
where, 1
they, 1
would, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
Gaetano, 1
to, 1
go--a, 1
refusal, 1
he, 1
could, 1
now, 1
comprehend., 1
Presently,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
change, 1
in, 1
the, 1
atmosphere,, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
entering, 1
a, 1
cave;, 1
after, 1
going, 1
on, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
seconds, 1
more, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
crackling,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
though, 1
the, 1
atmosphere, 1
again, 1
changed,, 1
and, 1
became, 1
balmy, 1
and, 1
perfumed., 1
At, 1
length, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
touched, 1
on, 1
a, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
soft, 1
carpet,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
guides, 1
let, 1
go, 1
their, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
him., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
a, 1
voice,, 1
in, 1
excellent, 1
French,, 1
although,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
foreign, 1
accent,, 1
said,, 1
"Welcome,, 1
sir., 1
I, 1
beg, 1
you, 1
will, 1
remove, 1
your, 1
bandage.", 1
It, 1
may, 1
be, 1
supposed,, 1
then,, 1
Franz, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
a, 1
repetition, 1
of, 1
this, 1
permission,, 1
but, 1
took, 1
off, 1
the, 1
handkerchief,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
from, 1
thirty-eight, 1
to, 1
forty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
Tunisian, 1
costume--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
a, 1
red, 1
cap, 1
with, 1
a, 1
long, 1
blue, 1
silk, 1
tassel,, 1
a, 1
vest, 1
of, 1
black, 1
cloth, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
pantaloons, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
red,, 1
large, 1
and, 1
full, 1
gaiters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
color,, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
gold, 1
like, 1
the, 1
vest,, 1
and, 1
yellow, 1
slippers;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
cashmere, 1
round, 1
his, 1
waist,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
small, 1
sharp, 1
and, 1
crooked, 1
cangiar, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
his, 1
girdle., 1
Although, 1
of, 1
a, 1
paleness, 1
that, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
livid,, 1
this, 1
man, 1
had, 1
a, 1
remarkably, 1
handsome, 1
face;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
penetrating, 1
and, 1
sparkling;, 1
his, 1
nose,, 1
quite, 1
straight,, 1
and, 1
projecting, 1
direct, 1
from, 1
the, 1
brow,, 1
was, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pure, 1
Greek, 1
type,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
teeth,, 1
as, 1
white, 1
as, 1
pearls,, 1
were, 1
set, 1
off, 1
to, 1
admiration, 1
by, 1
the, 1
black, 1
mustache, 1
that, 1
encircled, 1
them., 1
His, 1
pallor, 1
was, 1
so, 1
peculiar,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
pertain, 1
to, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
long, 1
entombed,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
was, 1
incapable, 1
of, 1
resuming, 1
the, 1
healthy, 1
glow, 1
and, 1
hue, 1
of, 1
life., 1
He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
particularly, 1
tall,, 1
but, 1
extremely, 1
well, 1
made,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
south,, 1
had, 1
small, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
feet., 1
But, 1
what, 1
astonished, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
treated, 1
Gaetano's, 1
description, 1
as, 1
a, 1
fable,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
splendor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself., 1
The, 1
entire, 1
chamber, 1
was, 1
lined, 1
with, 1
crimson, 1
brocade,, 1
worked, 1
with, 1
flowers, 1
of, 1
gold., 1
In, 1
a, 1
recess, 1
was, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
divan,, 1
surmounted, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stand, 1
of, 1
Arabian, 1
swords, 1
in, 1
silver, 1
scabbards,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
handles, 1
resplendent, 1
with, 1
gems;, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ceiling, 1
hung, 1
a, 1
lamp, 1
of, 1
Venetian, 1
glass,, 1
of, 1
beautiful, 1
shape, 1
and, 1
color,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
a, 1
Turkey, 1
carpet,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
they, 1
sunk, 1
to, 1
the, 1
instep;, 1
tapestry, 1
hung, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door, 1
by, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
another, 1
door,, 1
leading, 1
into, 1
a, 1
second, 1
apartment, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
brilliantly, 1
illuminated., 1
The, 1
host, 1
gave, 1
Franz, 1
time, 1
to, 1
recover, 1
from, 1
his, 1
surprise,, 1
and,, 1
moreover,, 1
returned, 1
look, 1
for, 1
look,, 1
not, 1
even, 1
taking, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
off, 1
him., 1
"Sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
pause,, 1
"a, 1
thousand, 1
excuses, 1
for, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
taken, 1
in, 1
your, 1
introduction, 1
hither;, 1
but, 1
as,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
greater, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
year,, 1
this, 1
island, 1
is, 1
deserted,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
this, 1
abode, 1
were, 1
discovered., 1
I, 1
should, 1
doubtless,, 1
find, 1
on, 1
my, 1
return, 1
my, 1
temporary, 1
retirement, 1
in, 1
a, 1
state, 1
of, 1
great, 1
disorder,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
exceedingly, 1
annoying,, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
loss, 1
it, 1
occasioned, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
the, 1
certainty, 1
I, 1
now, 1
possess, 1
of, 1
separating, 1
myself, 1
from, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
mankind, 1
at, 1
pleasure., 1
Let, 1
me, 1
now, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
make, 1
you, 1
forget, 1
this, 1
temporary, 1
unpleasantness,, 1
and, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
what, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
to, 1
find, 1
here--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
a, 1
tolerable, 1
supper, 1
and, 1
pretty, 1
comfortable, 1
beds.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"make, 1
no, 1
apologies., 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
observed, 1
that, 1
they, 1
bandage, 1
people's, 1
eyes, 1
who, 1
penetrate, 1
enchanted, 1
palaces,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Raoul, 1
in, 1
the, 1
'Huguenots,', 1
and, 1
really, 1
I, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
complain, 1
of,, 1
for, 1
what, 1
I, 1
see, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wonders, 1
of, 1
the, 1
'Arabian, 1
Nights.'", 1
"Alas,, 1
I, 1
may, 1
say, 1
with, 1
Lucullus,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
could, 1
have, 1
anticipated, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
your, 1
visit,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
it., 1

such, 1
as, 1
is, 1
my, 1
hermitage,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
at, 1
your, 1
disposal;, 1

Ali,, 1
is, 1
the, 1
supper, 1
ready?", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
tapestry, 1
moved, 1
aside,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
Nubian,, 1
black, 1
as, 1
ebony,, 1
and, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
plain, 1
white, 1
tunic,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
his, 1
master, 1
that, 1
all, 1
was, 1
prepared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dining-room., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
of, 1
my, 1
opinion,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
think, 1
nothing, 1
is, 1
more, 1
annoying, 1
than, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
hours, 1
together, 1
without, 1
knowing, 1
by, 1
name, 1
or, 1
appellation, 1
how, 1
to, 1
address, 1
one, 1
another., 1
Pray, 1
observe,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
too, 1
much, 1
respect, 1
the, 1
laws, 1
of, 1
hospitality, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
your, 1
name, 1
or, 1
title., 1
I, 1
only, 1
request, 1
you, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
one, 1
by, 1
which, 1
I, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
addressing, 1
you., 1
As, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
put, 1
you, 1
at, 1
your, 1
ease,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
generally, 1
called, 1
'Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.'", 1
"And, 1
I,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"will, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
only, 1
require, 1
his, 1
wonderful, 1
lamp, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
precisely, 1
like, 1
Aladdin,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
see, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
be, 1
called, 1
Aladdin., 1
That, 1
will, 1
keep, 1
us, 1
from, 1
going, 1
away, 1
from, 1
the, 1
East, 1
whither, 1
I, 1
am, 1
tempted, 1
to, 1
think, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
conveyed, 1
by, 1
some, 1
good, 1
genius.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
Signor, 1
Aladdin,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
amphitryon,, 1
"you, 1
heard, 1
our, 1
repast, 1
announced,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
now, 1
take, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
dining-room,, 1
your, 1
humble, 1
servant, 1
going, 1
first, 1
to, 1
show, 1
the, 1
way?", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
moving, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
tapestry,, 1
Sinbad, 1
preceded, 1
his, 1
guest., 1
Franz, 1
now, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
another, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
enchantment;, 1
the, 1
table, 1
was, 1
splendidly, 1
covered,, 1
and, 1
once, 1
convinced, 1
of, 1
this, 1
important, 1
point, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
around, 1
him., 1
The, 1
dining-room, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
less, 1
striking, 1
than, 1
the, 1
room, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
left;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
entirely, 1
of, 1
marble,, 1
with, 1
antique, 1
bas-reliefs, 1
of, 1
priceless, 1
value;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
four, 1
corners, 1
of, 1
this, 1
apartment,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
oblong,, 1
were, 1
four, 1
magnificent, 1
statues,, 1
having, 1
baskets, 1
in, 1
their, 1
hands., 1
These, 1
baskets, 1
contained, 1
four, 1
pyramids, 1
of, 1
most, 1
splendid, 1
fruit;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
Sicily, 1
pine-apples,, 1
pomegranates, 1
from, 1
Malaga,, 1
oranges, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Balearic, 1
Isles,, 1
peaches, 1
from, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
dates, 1
from, 1
Tunis., 1
The, 1
supper, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
roast, 1
pheasant, 1
garnished, 1
with, 1
Corsican, 1
blackbirds;, 1
a, 1
boar's, 1
ham, 1
with, 1
jelly,, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
kid, 1
with, 1
tartar, 1
sauce,, 1
a, 1
glorious, 1
turbot,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
gigantic, 1
lobster., 1
Between, 1
these, 1
large, 1
dishes, 1
were, 1
smaller, 1
ones, 1
containing, 1
various, 1
dainties., 1
The, 1
dishes, 1
were, 1
of, 1
silver,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
plates, 1
of, 1
Japanese, 1
china., 1
Franz, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
Ali, 1
alone, 1
was, 1
present, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
at, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
acquitted, 1
himself, 1
so, 1
admirably,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
guest, 1
complimented, 1
his, 1
host, 1
thereupon., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
did, 1
the, 1
honors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
supper, 1
with, 1
much, 1
ease, 1
and, 1
grace--"yes,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
devil, 1
who, 1
is, 1
much, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
does, 1
all, 1
he, 1
can, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
it., 1
He, 1
remembers, 1
that, 1
I, 1
saved, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
regard, 1
for, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
he, 1
feels, 1
some, 1
gratitude, 1
towards, 1
me, 1
for, 1
having, 1
kept, 1
it, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulders.", 1
Ali, 1
approached, 1
his, 1
master,, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
kissed, 1
it., 1
"Would, 1
it, 1
be, 1
impertinent,, 1
Signor, 1
Sinbad,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"to, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
this, 1
kindness?", 1
"Oh,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
simple, 1
enough,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
host., 1
"It, 1
seems, 1
the, 1
fellow, 1
had, 1
been, 1
caught, 1
wandering, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
the, 1
harem, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Bey, 1
of, 1
Tunis, 1
than, 1
etiquette, 1
permits, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
color,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
condemned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bey, 1
to, 1
have, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
cut, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
head, 1
cut, 1
off;, 1
the, 1
tongue, 1
the, 1
first, 1
day,, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
second,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
head, 1
the, 1
third., 1
I, 1
always, 1
had, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
mute, 1
in, 1
my, 1
service,, 1
so, 1
learning, 1
the, 1
day, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
was, 1
cut, 1
out,, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bey,, 1
and, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
for, 1
Ali, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
double-barreled, 1
gun, 1
which, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
he, 1
was, 1
very, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
having., 1
He, 1
hesitated, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
so, 1
very, 1
desirous, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
devil's, 1
punishment., 1
But, 1
when, 1
I, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gun, 1
an, 1
English, 1
cutlass, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
shivered, 1
his, 1
highness's, 1
yataghan, 1
to, 1
pieces,, 1
the, 1
bey, 1
yielded,, 1
and, 1
agreed, 1
to, 1
forgive, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
head,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
fellow, 1
never, 1
again, 1
set, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
Tunis., 1
This, 1
was, 1
a, 1
useless, 1
clause, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bargain,, 1
for, 1
whenever, 1
the, 1
coward, 1
sees, 1
the, 1
first, 1
glimpse, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shores, 1
of, 1
Africa,, 1
he, 1
runs, 1
down, 1
below,, 1
and, 1
can, 1
only, 1
be, 1
induced, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
again, 1
when, 1
we, 1
are, 1
out, 1
of, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
that, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
globe.", 1
Franz, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
pensive,, 1
hardly, 1
knowing, 1
what, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
half-kindness,, 1
half-cruelty,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
his, 1
host, 1
related, 1
the, 1
brief, 1
narrative., 1
"And, 1
like, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
sailor, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
you, 1
have, 1
assumed,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
"you, 1
pass, 1
your, 1
life, 1
in, 1
travelling?", 1
"Yes., 1
I, 1
made, 1
a, 1
vow, 1
at, 1
a, 1
time, 1
when, 1
I, 1
little, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
should, 1
ever, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
accomplish, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
with, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
smile;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
made, 1
some, 1
others, 1
also, 1
which, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
I, 1
may, 1
fulfil, 1
in, 1
due, 1
season.", 1
Although, 1
Sinbad, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
much, 1
calmness,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
gave, 1
forth, 1
gleams, 1
of, 1
extraordinary, 1
ferocity., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal,, 1
sir?", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
inquiringly., 1
Sinbad, 1
started, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
fixedly, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
replied,, 1
"What, 1
makes, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
so?", 1
"Everything,", 1
answered, 1
Franz,--"your, 1
voice,, 1
your, 1
look,, 1
your, 1
pallid, 1
complexion,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
the, 1
life, 1
you, 1
lead.", 1
"I?--I, 1
live, 1
the, 1
happiest, 1
life, 1
possible,, 1
the, 1
real, 1
life, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pasha., 1
I, 1
am, 1
king, 1
of, 1
all, 1
creation., 1
I, 1
am, 1
pleased, 1
with, 1
one, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
stay, 1
there;, 1
I, 1
get, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
leave, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
free, 1
as, 1
a, 1
bird, 1
and, 1
have, 1
wings, 1
like, 1
one;, 1
my, 1
attendants, 1
obey, 1
my, 1
slightest, 1
wish., 1
Sometimes, 1
I, 1
amuse, 1
myself, 1
by, 1
delivering, 1
some, 1
bandit, 1
or, 1
criminal, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bonds, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
have, 1
my, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
dispensing, 1
justice,, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
sure,, 1
without, 1
respite, 1
or, 1
appeal,, 1
which, 1
condemns, 1
or, 1
pardons,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
no, 1
one, 1
sees., 1
Ah,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
tasted, 1
my, 1
life,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
desire, 1
any, 1
other,, 1

would, 1
never, 1

had, 1
some, 1
great, 1
project, 1
to, 1
accomplish, 1
there.", 1
"Revenge,, 1
for, 1
instance!", 1
observed, 1
Franz., 1
The, 1
unknown, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
looks, 1
which, 1
penetrate, 1
into, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
and, 1
thoughts., 1
"And, 1
why, 1
revenge?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"Because,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"you, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
me, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
persecuted, 1
by, 1
society,, 1
has, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
account, 1
to, 1
settle, 1
with, 1

"Ah,", 1
responded, 1
Sinbad,, 1
laughing, 1
with, 1
his, 1
singular, 1
laugh, 1
which, 1
displayed, 1
his, 1
white, 1
and, 1
sharp, 1
teeth., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
not, 1
guessed, 1
rightly., 1

as, 1
you, 1
see, 1
me, 1

am,, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
philosopher,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
day, 1
perhaps, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Paris, 1
to, 1
rival, 1
Monsieur, 1
Appert,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
little, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
cloak.", 1
"And, 1
will, 1
that, 1
be, 1
the, 1

took, 1
that, 1

"Yes;, 1
it, 1
will., 1
I, 1
must, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
you, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
curious,, 1

I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1

happen, 1

"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
propose, 1
to, 1
make, 1
this, 1
journey, 1
very, 1
shortly?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know;, 1
it, 1
depends, 1
on, 1
circumstances, 1

depend, 1
on, 1

The, 1
supper, 1
appeared, 1

the, 1
splendid, 1
banquet, 1
to, 1
which, 1
his, 1
guest, 1
did, 1
ample, 1
justice., 1
Then, 1
Ali, 1
brought, 1
on, 1
the, 1
dessert,, 1

rather, 1
took, 1
the, 1
baskets, 1
from, 1

the, 1
table., 1
Between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
baskets, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
small, 1
silver, 1
cup, 1
with, 1
a, 1
silver, 1
cover., 1
The, 1
care, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Ali, 1
placed, 1
this, 1
cup, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
roused, 1
Franz's, 1
curiosity., 1
He, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
cover, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
greenish, 1
paste,, 1
something, 1
like, 1
preserved, 1
angelica,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
was, 1
perfectly, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
him., 1
He, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
lid,, 1
as, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
what, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
contained, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
casting, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
host, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
smile, 1
at, 1
his, 1
disappointment., 1
"You, 1
cannot, 1
guess,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"what, 1
there, 1
is, 1
in, 1
that, 1
small, 1
vase,, 1
can, 1
you?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
really, 1
cannot.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
green, 1
preserve, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
less, 1
than, 1
the, 1
ambrosia, 1
which, 1
Hebe, 1
served, 1
at, 1
the, 1
table, 1
of, 1
Jupiter.", 1
"But,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
ambrosia,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
in, 1
passing, 1
through, 1
mortal, 1
hands, 1

At, 1

words, 1
he, 1
uncovered, 1
the, 1
small, 1
cup, 1
which, 1
contained, 1
the, 1
substance, 1
so, 1
lauded,, 1
took, 1
a, 1

slowly, 1
with, 1
his, 1

half, 1
shut, 1

Franz, 1
did, 1

absorbed, 1
his, 1
favorite, 1
sweetmeat,, 1

when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
he, 1
inquired,--"What,, 1
then,, 1
is, 1
this, 1
precious, 1
stuff?", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1

he, 1

was, 1
overhung, 1
by, 1
the, 1
mountain, 1

In, 1

Marco, 1
Polo,, 1

What, 1
these, 1
happy, 1
persons, 1
took, 1
for, 1
reality, 1
was, 1

a, 1
dream;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
so, 1
soft,, 1
so, 1
voluptuous,, 1
so, 1
enthralling,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
sold, 1
themselves, 1
body, 1

soul, 1

him, 1

murmur,, 1
believing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
death, 1

a, 1
slight, 1
foretaste.", 1
"Then,", 1
cried, 1
Franz,, 1
"it, 1

hashish!, 1

that--by, 1
name, 1
at, 1
least.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
it, 1
precisely,, 1
Signor, 1
Aladdin;, 1
it, 1

hashish--the, 1
purest, 1

most, 1
unadulterated, 1
hashish, 1

Alexandria,--the, 1

Abou-Gor,, 1

with, 1

words,, 1
'A, 1

world, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dealer, 1
in, 1
happiness.'", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
very, 1
great, 1
inclination, 1
to, 1
judge, 1
for, 1

yourself,, 1
Signor, 1

do, 1
not, 1
confine, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
one, 1
trial., 1
Like, 1
everything, 1
else,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
habituate, 1
the, 1
senses, 1
to, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
impression,, 1
gentle, 1
or, 1
violent,, 1
sad, 1
or, 1
joyous., 1
There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
struggle, 1
in, 1
nature, 1
against, 1
this, 1
divine, 1
substance,--in, 1
nature, 1
which, 1
is, 1
not, 1
made, 1
for, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
clings, 1
to, 1
pain., 1
Nature, 1
subdued, 1
must, 1
yield, 1
in, 1
the, 1
combat,, 1
the, 1
dream, 1
must, 1
succeed, 1
to, 1
reality,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
dream, 1
reigns, 1
supreme,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
dream, 1
becomes, 1
life,, 1

life, 1
becomes, 1
the, 1
dream., 1
But, 1
what, 1
changes, 1
occur!, 1
It, 1
is, 1
only, 1
by, 1
comparing, 1

actual, 1
being, 1
with, 1
the, 1
joys, 1
of, 1

no, 1
longer,, 1

When, 1
you, 1
return, 1
to, 1
this, 1
mundane, 1
sphere, 1
from, 1
your, 1
visionary, 1

hashish.", 1
Franz's, 1
only, 1

a, 1
teaspoonful, 1

no!, 1

is, 1

a, 1
week,, 1

nothing, 1

delicacy, 1
of, 1
its, 1
flavor,, 1

now, 1
appears, 1

now, 1
go, 1
into, 1

entered, 1
still, 1
another, 1
apartment., 1

was, 1
simply, 1

richly, 1
furnished., 1
It, 1
was, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
large, 1
divan, 1
completely, 1
encircled, 1
it., 1
Divan,, 1
walls,, 1
ceiling,, 1
floor,, 1
were, 1
all, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
magnificent, 1
skins, 1
as, 1
soft, 1
and, 1
downy, 1
as, 1
the, 1
richest, 1
carpets;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
heavy-maned, 1
lion-skins, 1
from, 1
Atlas,, 1
striped, 1
tiger-skins, 1
from, 1
Bengal;, 1
panther-skins, 1

were, 1
strewn, 1
in, 1
profusion, 1
one, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
so, 1
that, 1

most, 1
mossy, 1
turf,, 1

reclining, 1
on, 1
the, 1

divan;, 1
chibouques, 1
with, 1
jasmine, 1
tubes, 1
and, 1
amber, 1
mouthpieces, 1
were, 1
within, 1
reach,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
prepared, 1
so, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
need, 1
to, 1
smoke, 1
the, 1

pipe, 1
twice., 1
Each, 1
of, 1
them, 1
took, 1
one,, 1
which, 1
Ali, 1
lighted, 1
and, 1
then, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
the, 1
coffee., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Sinbad, 1
gave, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
to, 1
thoughts, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
occupy, 1
him, 1
incessantly,, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1

of, 1
his, 1
conversation;, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
abandoned, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
that, 1
mute, 1
revery,, 1
into, 1

we, 1
always, 1
sink, 1
when, 1

to, 1
remove, 1
with, 1
its, 1
fume, 1
all, 1
the, 1
troubles, 1
of, 1
the, 1

smoker, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
all, 1
the, 1
visions, 1
of, 1
the, 1

Ali, 1
brought, 1
in, 1
the, 1
coffee., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
take, 1

the, 1
unknown;, 1
"in, 1

ways.", 1
"I, 1

take, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Turkish, 1
style,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,", 1

his, 1
host;, 1

Orientals;, 1
they, 1
are, 1
the, 1
only, 1
men, 1
who, 1
know, 1
how, 1
to, 1
live., 1
As, 1
for, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
added,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
singular, 1
smiles, 1
which, 1
did, 1
not, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
completed, 1
my, 1
affairs, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
and, 1
die, 1
in, 1
the, 1
East;, 1
and, 1
should, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me, 1
again,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
seek, 1
me, 1
at, 1
Cairo,, 1
Bagdad,, 1
or, 1
Ispahan.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
easiest, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
eagle's, 1
wings, 1
springing, 1
out, 1
at, 1
my, 1
shoulders,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
those, 1
wings, 1
I, 1
could, 1
make, 1
a, 1
tour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world, 1
in, 1
four, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
hours.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
the, 1
hashish, 1
is, 1
beginning, 1
its, 1
work., 1
Well,, 1
unfurl, 1
your, 1
wings,, 1
and, 1
fly, 1
into, 1
superhuman, 1
regions;, 1
fear, 1
nothing,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
you;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
your, 1
wings,, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Icarus,, 1
melt, 1
before, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
here, 1
to, 1
ease, 1
your, 1
fall.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
said, 1
something, 1
in, 1
Arabic, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
obedience, 1
and, 1
withdrew,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
to, 1
any, 1
distance., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
transformation, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
in, 1
him., 1
All, 1
the, 1
bodily, 1
fatigue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
preoccupation, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
which, 1
the, 1
events, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
on,, 1
disappeared, 1
as, 1
they, 1
do, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
sleep,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
are, 1
still, 1
sufficiently, 1
conscious, 1
to, 1
be, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coming, 1
of, 1
slumber., 1
His, 1
body, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
acquire, 1
an, 1
airy, 1
lightness,, 1
his, 1
perception, 1
brightened, 1
in, 1
a, 1
remarkable, 1
manner,, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
redouble, 1
their, 1
power,, 1
the, 1
horizon, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
expand;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
horizon, 1
of, 1
vague, 1
alarms,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
before, 1
he, 1
slept,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
blue,, 1
transparent,, 1
unbounded, 1
horizon,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
spangles, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
perfumes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
summer, 1
breeze;, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
songs, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sailors,--songs, 1
so, 1
clear, 1
and, 1
sonorous,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
divine, 1
harmony, 1
had, 1
their, 1
notes, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
down,--he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
as, 1
a, 1
threatening, 1
rock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
an, 1
oasis, 1
in, 1
the, 1
desert;, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
his, 1
boat, 1
drew, 1
nearer,, 1
the, 1
songs, 1
became, 1
louder,, 1
for, 1
an, 1
enchanting, 1
and, 1
mysterious, 1
harmony, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
some, 1
Loreley, 1
had, 1
decreed, 1
to, 1
attract, 1
a, 1
soul, 1
thither,, 1
or, 1
Amphion,, 1
the, 1
enchanter,, 1
intended, 1
there, 1
to, 1
build, 1
a, 1
city., 1
At, 1
length, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
effort,, 1
without, 1
shock,, 1
as, 1
lips, 1
touch, 1
lips;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
amidst, 1
continued, 1
strains, 1
of, 1
most, 1
delicious, 1
melody., 1
He, 1
descended,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
descend,, 1
several, 1
steps,, 1
inhaling, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
and, 1
balmy, 1
air,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
which, 1
may, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
reign, 1
around, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
Circe,, 1
formed, 1
from, 1
such, 1
perfumes, 1
as, 1
set, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
a, 1
dreaming,, 1
and, 1
such, 1
fires, 1
as, 1
burn, 1
the, 1
very, 1
senses;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
again, 1
all, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
before, 1
his, 1
sleep,, 1
from, 1
Sinbad,, 1
his, 1
singular, 1
host,, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
the, 1
mute, 1
attendant;, 1
then, 1
all, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
fade, 1
away, 1
and, 1
become, 1
confused, 1
before, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
last, 1
shadows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magic, 1
lantern, 1
before, 1
it, 1
is, 1
extinguished,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
again, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
statues,, 1
lighted, 1
only, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
antique, 1
lamps, 1
which, 1
watch, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night, 1
over, 1
the, 1
sleep, 1
of, 1
pleasure., 1
They, 1
were, 1
the, 1
same, 1
statues,, 1
rich, 1
in, 1
form,, 1
in, 1
attraction,, 1
and, 1
poesy,, 1
with, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
fascination,, 1
smiles, 1
of, 1
love,, 1
and, 1
bright, 1
and, 1
flowing, 1
hair., 1
They, 1
were, 1
Phryne,, 1
Cleopatra,, 1
Messalina,, 1
those, 1
three, 1
celebrated, 1
courtesans., 1
Then, 1
among, 1
them, 1
glided, 1
like, 1
a, 1
pure, 1
ray,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
Christian, 1
angel, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
Olympus,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
chaste, 1
figures,, 1
those, 1
calm, 1
shadows,, 1
those, 1
soft, 1
visions,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
veil, 1
its, 1
virgin, 1
brow, 1
before, 1
these, 1
marble, 1
wantons., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
three, 1
statues, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
with, 1
looks, 1
of, 1
love,, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
couch, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
reposing,, 1
their, 1
feet, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
their, 1
long, 1
white, 1
tunics,, 1
their, 1
throats, 1
bare,, 1
hair, 1
flowing, 1
like, 1
waves,, 1
and, 1
assuming, 1
attitudes, 1
which, 1
the, 1
gods, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
saints, 1
withstood,, 1
and, 1
looks, 1
inflexible, 1
and, 1
ardent, 1
like, 1
those, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
serpent, 1
charms, 1
the, 1
bird;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
before, 1
looks, 1
that, 1
held, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
torturing, 1
grasp, 1
and, 1
delighted, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
as, 1
with, 1
a, 1
voluptuous, 1
kiss., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
that, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
last, 1
look, 1
about, 1
him, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
vision, 1
of, 1
modesty, 1
completely, 1
veiled;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
followed, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
of, 1
passion, 1
like, 1
that, 1
promised, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Prophet, 1
to, 1
the, 1
elect., 1
Lips, 1
of, 1
stone, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
flame,, 1
breasts, 1
of, 1
ice, 1
became, 1
like, 1
heated, 1
lava,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
yielding, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sway, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drug,, 1
love, 1
was, 1
a, 1
sorrow, 1
and, 1
voluptuousness, 1
a, 1
torture,, 1
as, 1
burning, 1
mouths, 1
were, 1
pressed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
thirsty, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
held, 1
in, 1
cool, 1
serpent-like, 1
embraces., 1
The, 1
more, 1
he, 1
strove, 1
against, 1
this, 1
unhallowed, 1
passion, 1
the, 1
more, 1
his, 1
senses, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
its, 1
thrall,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
weary, 1
of, 1
a, 1
struggle, 1
that, 1
taxed, 1
his, 1
very, 1
soul,, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
and, 1
sank, 1
back, 1
breathless, 1
and, 1
exhausted, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
kisses, 1
of, 1
these, 1
marble, 1
goddesses,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
enchantment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
marvellous, 1
dream., 1
Chapter, 1
32., 1
The, 1
Waking., 1
When, 1
Franz, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
still, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sepulchre,, 1
into, 1
which, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
sunlight, 1
in, 1
pity, 1
scarcely, 1
penetrated., 1
He, 1
stretched, 1
forth, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
touched, 1
stone;, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
lying, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bournous, 1
in, 1
a, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
dry, 1
heather,, 1
very, 1
soft, 1
and, 1
odoriferous., 1
The, 1
vision, 1
had, 1
fled;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
statues, 1
had, 1
been, 1
but, 1
shadows, 1
from, 1
the, 1
tomb,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
vanished, 1
at, 1
his, 1
waking., 1
He, 1
advanced, 1
several, 1
paces, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
point, 1
whence, 1
the, 1
light, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
all, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dream, 1
succeeded, 1
the, 1
calmness, 1
of, 1
reality., 1
He, 1
found, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
grotto,, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
and, 1
through, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
fanlight, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
sea, 1
and, 1
an, 1
azure, 1
sky., 1
The, 1
air, 1
and, 1
water, 1
were, 1
shining, 1
in, 1
the, 1
beams, 1
of, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
sun;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shore, 1
the, 1
sailors, 1
were, 1
sitting,, 1
chatting, 1
and, 1
laughing;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
yards, 1
from, 1
them, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
at, 1
anchor,, 1
undulating, 1
gracefully, 1
on, 1
the, 1
water., 1
There, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
he, 1
enjoyed, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
breeze, 1
which, 1
played, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dash, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
on, 1
the, 1
beach,, 1
that, 1
left, 1
against, 1
the, 1
rocks, 1
a, 1
lace, 1
of, 1
foam, 1
as, 1
white, 1
as, 1
silver., 1
He, 1
was, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
without, 1
reflection, 1
or, 1
thought, 1
for, 1
the, 1
divine, 1
charm, 1
which, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
things, 1
of, 1
nature,, 1
specially, 1
after, 1
a, 1
fantastic, 1
dream;, 1
then, 1
gradually, 1
this, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
world,, 1
so, 1
calm,, 1
so, 1
pure,, 1
so, 1
grand,, 1
reminded, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
illusiveness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vision,, 1
and, 1
once, 1
more, 1
awakened, 1
memory., 1
He, 1
recalled, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
on, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
his, 1
presentation, 1
to, 1
a, 1
smuggler, 1
chief,, 1
a, 1
subterranean, 1
palace, 1
full, 1
of, 1
splendor,, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
supper,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
spoonful, 1
of, 1
hashish., 1
It, 1
seemed,, 1
however,, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1
very, 1
face, 1
of, 1
open, 1
day,, 1
that, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
year, 1
had, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
all, 1
these, 1
things, 1
had, 1
passed,, 1
so, 1
deep, 1
was, 1
the, 1
impression, 1
made, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
by, 1
the, 1
dream,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
strong, 1
a, 1
hold, 1
had, 1
it, 1
taken, 1
of, 1
his, 1
imagination., 1
Thus, 1
every, 1
now, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
in, 1
fancy, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
seated, 1
on, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
or, 1
undulating, 1
in, 1
the, 1
vessel,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shadows, 1
which, 1
had, 1
shared, 1
his, 1
dream, 1
with, 1
looks, 1
and, 1
kisses., 1
Otherwise,, 1
his, 1
head, 1
was, 1
perfectly, 1
clear,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
body, 1
refreshed;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
free, 1
from, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
headache;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
lightness,, 1
a, 1
faculty, 1
for, 1
absorbing, 1
the, 1
pure, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
enjoying, 1
the, 1
bright, 1
sunshine, 1
more, 1
vividly, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
He, 1
went, 1
gayly, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
who, 1
rose, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
they, 1
perceived, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
accosting, 1
him,, 1
said,, 1
"The, 1
Signor, 1
Sinbad, 1
has, 1
left, 1
his, 1
compliments, 1
for, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
and, 1
desires, 1
us, 1
to, 1
express, 1
the, 1
regret, 1
he, 1
feels, 1
at, 1
not, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
take, 1
his, 1
leave, 1
in, 1
person;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
trusts, 1
you, 1
will, 1
excuse, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
very, 1
important, 1
business, 1
calls, 1
him, 1
to, 1
Malaga.", 1
"So,, 1
then,, 1
Gaetano,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
is,, 1
then,, 1
all, 1
reality;, 1
there, 1
exists, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
has, 1
received, 1
me, 1
in, 1
this, 1
island,, 1
entertained, 1
me, 1
right, 1
royally,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
departed, 1
while, 1
I, 1
was, 1
asleep?", 1
"He, 1
exists, 1
as, 1
certainly, 1
as, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
see, 1
his, 1
small, 1
yacht, 1
with, 1
all, 1
her, 1
sails, 1
spread;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
use, 1
your, 1
glass,, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
recognize, 1
your, 1
host, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
his, 1
crew.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
Gaetano, 1
pointed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
direction, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
small, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
making, 1
sail, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
southern, 1
point, 1
of, 1
Corsica., 1
Franz, 1
adjusted, 1
his, 1
telescope,, 1
and, 1
directed, 1
it, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
yacht., 1
Gaetano, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken., 1
At, 1
the, 1
stern, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
stranger, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
up, 1
looking, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
and, 1
holding, 1
a, 1
spy-glass, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
He, 1
was, 1
attired, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
waved, 1
his, 1
pocket-handkerchief, 1
to, 1
his, 1
guest, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
adieu., 1
Franz, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
salute, 1
by, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
as, 1
an, 1
exchange, 1
of, 1
signals., 1
After, 1
a, 1
second,, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
cloud, 1
of, 1
smoke, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
stern, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vessel,, 1
which, 1
rose, 1
gracefully, 1
as, 1
it, 1
expanded, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
Franz, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
report., 1
"There,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
hear?", 1
observed, 1
Gaetano;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
bidding, 1
you, 1
adieu.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
took, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
and, 1
fired, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
any, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
could, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
at, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
which, 1
separated, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
from, 1
the, 1
shore., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
your, 1
excellency's, 1
orders?", 1
inquired, 1
Gaetano., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
light, 1
me, 1
a, 1
torch.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
understand,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
"to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
enchanted, 1
apartment., 1
With, 1
much, 1
pleasure,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
would, 1
amuse, 1
you;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
get, 1
you, 1
the, 1
torch, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
for., 1
But, 1
I, 1
too, 1
have, 1
had, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
you, 1
have,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times, 1
the, 1
same, 1
fancy, 1
has, 1
come, 1
over, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
given, 1
it, 1
up., 1
Giovanni,, 1
light, 1
a, 1
torch,", 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"and, 1
give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
excellency.", 1
Giovanni, 1
obeyed., 1
Franz, 1
took, 1
the, 1
lamp,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
subterranean, 1
grotto,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Gaetano., 1
He, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
place, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
awaked, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
heather, 1
that, 1
was, 1
there;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
that, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
his, 1
torch, 1
all, 1
round, 1
the, 1
exterior, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
nothing,, 1
unless, 1
that,, 1
by, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
smoke,, 1
others, 1
had, 1
before, 1
him, 1
attempted, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
him,, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
Yet, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
a, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
this, 1
granite, 1
wall,, 1
as, 1
impenetrable, 1
as, 1
futurity,, 1
without, 1
strict, 1
scrutiny;, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
a, 1
fissure, 1
without, 1
introducing, 1
the, 1
blade, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hunting, 1
sword, 1
into, 1
it,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
projecting, 1
point, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lean, 1
and, 1
press, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hopes, 1
it, 1
would, 1
give, 1
way., 1
All, 1
was, 1
vain;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
lost, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
in, 1
his, 1
attempts,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
at, 1
last, 1
utterly, 1
useless., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
this, 1
time, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
up, 1
his, 1
search,, 1
and, 1
Gaetano, 1
smiled., 1
When, 1
Franz, 1
appeared, 1
again, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
only, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
a, 1
small, 1
white, 1
speck, 1
on, 1
the, 1
horizon., 1
He, 1
looked, 1
again, 1
through, 1
his, 1
glass,, 1
but, 1
even, 1
then, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
distinguish, 1
anything., 1
Gaetano, 1
reminded, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
shooting, 1
goats,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
utterly, 1
forgotten., 1
He, 1
took, 1
his, 1
fowling-piece,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
hunt, 1
over, 1
the, 1
island, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
is, 1
fulfilling, 1
a, 1
duty,, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
enjoying, 1
a, 1
pleasure;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
he, 1
had, 1
killed, 1
a, 1
goat, 1
and, 1
two, 1
kids., 1
These, 1
animals,, 1
though, 1
wild, 1
and, 1
agile, 1
as, 1
chamois,, 1
were, 1
too, 1
much, 1
like, 1
domestic, 1
goats,, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
could, 1
not, 1
consider, 1
them, 1
as, 1
game., 1
Moreover,, 1
other, 1
ideas,, 1
much, 1
more, 1
enthralling,, 1
occupied, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
Since,, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
before,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
really, 1
been, 1
the, 1
hero, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tales, 1
of, 1
the, 1
"Thousand, 1
and, 1
One, 1
Nights,", 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
irresistibly, 1
attracted, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
grotto., 1
Then,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
failure, 1
of, 1
his, 1
first, 1
search,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
a, 1
second,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
told, 1
Gaetano, 1
to, 1
roast, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
kids., 1
The, 1
second, 1
visit, 1
was, 1
a, 1
long, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
kid, 1
was, 1
roasted, 1
and, 1
the, 1
repast, 1
ready., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening, 1
when, 1
his, 1
mysterious, 1
host, 1
had, 1
invited, 1
him, 1
to, 1
supper;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
little, 1
yacht,, 1
now, 1
like, 1
a, 1
sea-gull, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wave,, 1
continuing, 1
her, 1
flight, 1
towards, 1
Corsica., 1
"Why,", 1
he, 1
remarked, 1
to, 1
Gaetano,, 1
"you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
Signor, 1
Sinbad, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Malaga,, 1
while, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
he, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Porto-Vecchio.", 1
"Don't, 1
you, 1
remember,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
patron,, 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
there, 1
were, 1
two, 1
Corsican, 1
brigands?", 1
"True;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
land, 1
them,", 1
added, 1
Franz., 1
"Precisely, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
Gaetano., 1
"Ah,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
one, 1
who, 1
fears, 1
neither, 1
God, 1
nor, 1
Satan,, 1
they, 1
say,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
at, 1
any, 1
time, 1
run, 1
fifty, 1
leagues, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
course, 1
to, 1
do, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
devil, 1
a, 1
service.", 1
"But, 1
such, 1
services, 1
as, 1
these, 1
might, 1
involve, 1
him, 1
with, 1
the, 1
authorities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
country, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
practices, 1
this, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
philanthropy,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
cares, 1
he, 1
for, 1
that,", 1
replied, 1
Gaetano, 1
with, 1
a, 1
laugh,, 1
"or, 1
any, 1
authorities?, 1
He, 1
smiles, 1
at, 1
them., 1
Let, 1
them, 1
try, 1
to, 1
pursue, 1
him!, 1
Why,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
his, 1
yacht, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
ship,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
bird,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
would, 1
beat, 1
any, 1
frigate, 1
three, 1
knots, 1
in, 1
every, 1
nine;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
coast,, 1
why,, 1
is, 1
he, 1
not, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
friends, 1
everywhere?", 1
It, 1
was, 1
perfectly, 1
clear, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Signor, 1
Sinbad,, 1
Franz's, 1
host,, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
being, 1
on, 1
excellent, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
and, 1
bandits, 1
along, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
coast, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
enjoyed, 1
exceptional, 1
privileges., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
inducement, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
He, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
all, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
detecting, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto;, 1
he, 1
consequently, 1
despatched, 1
his, 1
breakfast,, 1
and,, 1
his, 1
boat, 1
being, 1
ready,, 1
he, 1
hastened, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
were, 1
soon, 1
under, 1
way., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
began, 1
her, 1
course, 1
they, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yacht,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gulf, 1
of, 1
Porto-Vecchio., 1
With, 1
it, 1
was, 1
effaced, 1
the, 1
last, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
night;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
supper,, 1
Sinbad,, 1
hashish,, 1
statues,--all, 1
became, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
for, 1
Franz., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
sailed, 1
on, 1
all, 1
day, 1
and, 1
all, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
next, 1
morning,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
rose,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
When, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
once, 1
again, 1
set, 1
foot, 1
on, 1
shore,, 1
he, 1
forgot,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
the, 1
events, 1
which, 1
had, 1
just, 1
passed,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
finished, 1
his, 1
affairs, 1
of, 1
pleasure, 1
at, 1
Florence,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
how, 1
he, 1
should, 1
rejoin, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
awaiting, 1
him, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
He, 1
set, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Saturday, 1
evening, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
Eternal, 1
City, 1
by, 1
the, 1
mail-coach., 1
An, 1
apartment,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
retained, 1
beforehand,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
he, 1
had, 1
but, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini's, 1
hotel., 1
But, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
so, 1
easy, 1
a, 1
matter,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
were, 1
thronged, 1
with, 1
people,, 1
and, 1
Rome, 1
was, 1
already, 1
a, 1
prey, 1
to, 1
that, 1
low, 1
and, 1
feverish, 1
murmur, 1
which, 1
precedes, 1
all, 1
great, 1
events;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
there, 1
are, 1
four, 1
great, 1
events, 1
in, 1
every, 1
year,--the, 1
Carnival,, 1
Holy, 1
Week,, 1
Corpus, 1
Christi,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Feast, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Peter., 1
All, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
year, 1
the, 1
city, 1
is, 1
in, 1
that, 1
state, 1
of, 1
dull, 1
apathy,, 1
between, 1
life, 1
and, 1
death,, 1
which, 1
renders, 1
it, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
station, 1
between, 1
this, 1
world, 1
and, 1
the, 1
next--a, 1
sublime, 1
spot,, 1
a, 1
resting-place, 1
full, 1
of, 1
poetry, 1
and, 1
character,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
already, 1
halted, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
each, 1
time, 1
found, 1
it, 1
more, 1
marvellous, 1
and, 1
striking., 1
At, 1
last, 1
he, 1
made, 1
his, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
mob,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
continually, 1
increasing, 1
and, 1
getting, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
turbulent,, 1
and, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
On, 1
his, 1
first, 1
inquiry, 1
he, 1
was, 1
told,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
impertinence, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
hired, 1
hackney-coachmen, 1
and, 1
inn-keepers, 1
with, 1
their, 1
houses, 1
full,, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
room, 1
for, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
his, 1
card, 1
to, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
This, 1
plan, 1
succeeded;, 1
and, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
himself, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
excusing, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
having, 1
made, 1
his, 1
excellency, 1
wait,, 1
scolding, 1
the, 1
waiters,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
candlestick, 1
from, 1
the, 1
porter,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
pounce, 1
on, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
him, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
when, 1
Morcerf, 1
himself, 1
appeared., 1
The, 1
apartment, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
two, 1
small, 1
rooms, 1
and, 1
a, 1
parlor., 1
The, 1
two, 1
rooms, 1
looked, 1
onto, 1
the, 1
street--a, 1
fact, 1
which, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
commented, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
an, 1
inappreciable, 1
advantage., 1
The, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
was, 1
hired, 1
by, 1
a, 1
very, 1
rich, 1
gentleman, 1
who, 1
was, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
Sicilian, 1
or, 1
Maltese;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
host, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
decide, 1
to, 1
which, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
nations, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
belonged., 1
"Very, 1
good,, 1
signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
said, 1
Franz;, 1
"but, 1
we, 1
must, 1
have, 1
some, 1
supper, 1
instantly,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
for, 1
tomorrow, 1
and, 1
the, 1
following, 1
days.", 1
"As, 1
to, 1
supper,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
landlord,, 1
"you, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
served, 1
immediately;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
for, 1
the, 1
carriage"--, 1
"What, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
carriage?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert., 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
no, 1
joking;, 1
we, 1
must, 1
have, 1
a, 1
carriage.", 1
"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
host,, 1
"we, 1
will, 1
do, 1
all, 1
in, 1
our, 1
power, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
you, 1
one--this, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say.", 1
"And, 1
when, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
know?", 1
inquired, 1
Franz., 1
"To-morrow, 1
morning,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper., 1
"Oh,, 1
the, 1
deuce!, 1
then, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
more,, 1
that's, 1
all,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
plainly, 1
enough., 1
At, 1
Drake's, 1
or, 1
Aaron's, 1
one, 1
pays, 1
twenty-five, 1
lire, 1
for, 1
common, 1
days,, 1
and, 1
thirty, 1
or, 1
thirty-five, 1
lire, 1
a, 1
day, 1
more, 1
for, 1
Sundays, 1
and, 1
feast, 1
days;, 1
add, 1
five, 1
lire, 1
a, 1
day, 1
more, 1
for, 1
extras,, 1
that, 1
will, 1
make, 1
forty,, 1
and, 1
there's, 1
an, 1
end, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
afraid, 1
if, 1
we, 1
offer, 1
them, 1
double, 1
that, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
procure, 1
a, 1
carriage.", 1
"Then, 1
they, 1
must, 1
put, 1
horses, 1
to, 1
mine., 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
little, 1
worse, 1
for, 1
the, 1
journey,, 1
but, 1
that's, 1
no, 1
matter.", 1
"There, 1
are, 1
no, 1
horses.", 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Franz, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
hears, 1
a, 1
reply, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
understand., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Franz--no, 1
horses?", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"but, 1
can't, 1
we, 1
have, 1
post-horses?", 1
"They, 1
have, 1
been, 1
all, 1
hired, 1
this, 1
fortnight,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
are, 1
none, 1
left, 1
but, 1
those, 1
absolutely, 1
requisite, 1
for, 1
posting.", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
we, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
this?", 1
asked, 1
Franz., 1
"I, 1
say,, 1
that, 1
when, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
completely, 1
surpasses, 1
my, 1
comprehension,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
accustomed, 1
not, 1
to, 1
dwell, 1
on, 1
that, 1
thing,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
to, 1
another., 1
Is, 1
supper, 1
ready,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
sup.", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
horses?", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"Be, 1
easy,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
boy;, 1
they, 1
will, 1
come, 1
in, 1
due, 1
season;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
a, 1
question, 1
of, 1
how, 1
much, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
charged, 1
for, 1
them.", 1
Morcerf, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
delighted, 1
philosophy, 1
which, 1
believes, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
a, 1
full, 1
purse, 1
or, 1
well-lined, 1
pocketbook,, 1
supped,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed,, 1
slept, 1
soundly,, 1
and, 1
dreamed, 1
he, 1
was, 1
racing, 1
all, 1
over, 1
Rome, 1
at, 1
Carnival, 1
time, 1
in, 1
a, 1
coach, 1
with, 1
six, 1
horses., 1
Chapter, 1
33., 1
Roman, 1
Bandits., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
Franz, 1
woke, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
instantly, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell., 1
The, 1
sound, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
died, 1
away, 1
when, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
himself, 1
entered., 1
"Well,, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
landlord, 1
triumphantly,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
question, 1
him,, 1
"I, 1
feared, 1
yesterday,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
anything,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
too, 1
late--there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
single, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
be, 1
had--that, 1
is,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
days, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carnival.", 1
"Yes,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"for, 1
the, 1
very, 1
three, 1
days, 1
it, 1
is, 1
most, 1
needed.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
entering;, 1
"no, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
be, 1
had?", 1
"Just, 1
so,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
guessed, 1
it.", 1
"Well,, 1
your, 1
Eternal, 1
City, 1
is, 1
a, 1
nice, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
place.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
excellency,", 1
replied, 1
Pastrini,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
keeping, 1
up, 1
the, 1
dignity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Christian, 1
world, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
guest,, 1
"that, 1
there, 1
are, 1
no, 1
carriages, 1
to, 1
be, 1
had, 1
from, 1
Sunday, 1
to, 1
Tuesday, 1
evening,, 1
but, 1
from, 1
now, 1
till, 1
Sunday, 1
you, 1
can, 1
have, 1
fifty, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
"Ah,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
something,", 1
said, 1
Albert;, 1
"to-day, 1
is, 1
Thursday,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
what, 1
may, 1
arrive, 1
between, 1
this, 1
and, 1
Sunday?", 1
"Ten, 1
or, 1
twelve, 1
thousand, 1
travellers, 1
will, 1
arrive,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"which, 1
will, 1
make, 1
it, 1
still, 1
more, 1
difficult.", 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
enjoy, 1
the, 1
present, 1
without, 1
gloomy, 1
forebodings, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future.", 1
"At, 1
least, 1
we, 1
can, 1
have, 1
a, 1
window?", 1
"Where?", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
Corso.", 1
"Ah,, 1
a, 1
window!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,--"utterly, 1
impossible;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
only, 1
one, 1
left, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Doria, 1
Palace,, 1

that, 1
has, 1
been, 1

to, 1
a, 1
Russian, 1
prince, 1
for, 1
twenty, 1
sequins, 1
a, 1
day.", 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
stupefaction., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
best, 1
thing, 1
we, 1
can, 1
do?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
at, 1
Venice;, 1
there, 1
we, 1
are, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
obtaining, 1
gondolas, 1
if, 1
we, 1
cannot, 1
have, 1
carriages.", 1
"Ah,, 1
the, 1
devil,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
Albert;, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
Rome, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will,, 1
though, 1
I, 1
see, 1
it, 1
on, 1
stilts.", 1
"Bravo!, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
idea., 1
We, 1
will, 1
disguise, 1
ourselves, 1
as, 1
monster, 1
pulchinellos, 1
or, 1
shepherds, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Landes,, 1

we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
complete, 1
success.", 1
"Do, 1
your, 1

wish, 1
for, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
from, 1
now, 1
to, 1
Sunday, 1
morning?", 1
"Parbleu!", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
we, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
run, 1
about, 1
on, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1

lawyer's, 1
clerks?", 1
"I, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
your, 1
excellencies', 1
wishes;, 1
only,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
beforehand,, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1

cost, 1
you, 1
six, 1
piastres, 1
a, 1
day.", 1
"And,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
a, 1
millionaire,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
in, 1
the, 1
next, 1
apartments,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
warn, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
four, 1
times, 1
before, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
the, 1
prices, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
carriages;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
twelve, 1
piastres, 1
for, 1
to-day,, 1
tomorrow,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
you, 1
will, 1
make, 1
a, 1
good, 1
profit.", 1
"But,, 1
excellency"--said, 1
Pastrini,, 1
still, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
his, 1
point., 1
"Now, 1
go,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"or, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
bargain, 1
with, 1
your, 1
affettatore,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
mine, 1
also;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
an, 1
old, 1

a, 1
less, 1

one, 1
I, 1
offer, 1
you;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
lose, 1
the, 1
preference,, 1

that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
your, 1
fault.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
give, 1
yourselves, 1
the, 1
trouble,, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
smile, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
speculator, 1
when, 1
he, 1
confesses, 1
defeat;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
all, 1
I, 1
can,, 1

I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
satisfied.", 1
"And, 1
now, 1
we, 1
understand, 1
each, 1
other.", 1
"When, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
the, 1

here?", 1
"In, 1
an, 1
hour.", 1
"In, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
An, 1
hour, 1
after, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
hack, 1
conveyance, 1
which, 1
was, 1
elevated, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rank, 1
of, 1
a, 1
private, 1
carriage, 1
in, 1
honor, 1
of, 1

in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
its, 1
humble, 1
exterior,, 1

young, 1
men, 1
would, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
themselves, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
have, 1
secured, 1
it, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
days, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival., 1
"Excellency,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
cicerone,, 1
seeing, 1
Franz, 1
approach, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
"shall, 1
I, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
the, 1
palace?", 1
Accustomed, 1
as, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
phraseology,, 1
his, 1
first, 1
impulse, 1
was, 1
to, 1
look, 1
round, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
these, 1
words, 1
were, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
the, 1
"excellency,", 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
was, 1
the, 1
"carriage,", 1
and, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres, 1
was, 1
the, 1
"palace.", 1
The, 1
genius, 1
for, 1
laudation, 1
characteristic, 1
of, 1
the, 1
race, 1
was, 1
in, 1
that, 1
phrase., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
descended,, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
palace;, 1
their, 1
excellencies, 1
stretched, 1
their, 1
legs, 1
along, 1
the, 1
seats;, 1
the, 1
cicerone, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
behind., 1
"Where, 1
do, 1
your, 1
excellencies, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
go?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"To, 1
Saint, 1
Peter's, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,", 1
returned, 1
Albert., 1
But, 1
Albert, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
it, 1
takes, 1
a, 1
day, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Saint, 1
Peter's,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
month, 1
to, 1
study, 1
it., 1
The, 1
day, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
at, 1
Saint, 1
Peter's, 1
alone., 1
Suddenly, 1
the, 1
daylight, 1
began, 1
to, 1
fade, 1
away;, 1
Franz, 1
took, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch--it, 1
was, 1
half-past, 1
four., 1
They, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hotel;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
Franz, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
at, 1
eight., 1
He, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
show, 1
Albert, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
by, 1
moonlight,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
shown, 1
him, 1
Saint, 1
Peter's, 1
by, 1
daylight., 1
When, 1
we, 1
show, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
a, 1
city, 1
one, 1
has, 1
already, 1
visited,, 1
we, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
same, 1
pride, 1
as, 1
when, 1
we, 1
point, 1
out, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
whose, 1
lover, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been., 1
He, 1
was, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
city, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
skirt, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
re-enter, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
San, 1
Giovanni;, 1
thus, 1
they, 1
would, 1
behold, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
without, 1
finding, 1
their, 1
impressions, 1
dulled, 1
by, 1
first, 1
looking, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Capitol,, 1
the, 1
Forum,, 1
the, 1
Arch, 1
of, 1
Septimus, 1
Severus,, 1
the, 1
Temple, 1
of, 1
Antoninus, 1
and, 1
Faustina,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Sacra., 1
They, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
to, 1
dinner., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
them, 1
a, 1
banquet;, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
them, 1
a, 1
tolerable, 1
repast., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dinner, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
in, 1
person., 1
Franz, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
his, 1
dinner, 1
praised,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
accordingly,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
words, 1
he, 1
was, 1
interrupted., 1
"Excellency,", 1
said, 1
Pastrini,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
have, 1
your, 1
approbation,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
for, 1
that, 1
I, 1
came.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
you, 1
have, 1
procured, 1
a, 1
carriage?", 1
asked, 1
Albert,, 1
lighting, 1
his, 1
cigar., 1
"No;, 1
and, 1
your, 1
excellencies, 1
will, 1
do, 1
well, 1
not, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
that, 1
any, 1
longer;, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
things, 1
can, 1
or, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
done;, 1
when, 1
you, 1
are, 1
told, 1
anything, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
done,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
an, 1
end, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
much, 1
more, 1
convenient, 1
at, 1
Paris,--when, 1
anything, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
done,, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
double,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
done, 1
directly.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
what, 1
all, 1
the, 1
French, 1
say,", 1
returned, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
somewhat, 1
piqued;, 1
"for, 1
that, 1
reason,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
why, 1
they, 1
travel.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
emitting, 1
a, 1
volume, 1
of, 1
smoke, 1
and, 1
balancing, 1
his, 1
chair, 1
on, 1
its, 1
hind, 1
legs,, 1
"only, 1
madmen,, 1
or, 1
blockheads, 1
like, 1
us,, 1
ever, 1
do, 1
travel., 1
Men, 1
in, 1
their, 1
senses, 1
do, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
their, 1
hotel, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
du, 1
Helder,, 1
their, 1
walk, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Boulevard, 1
de, 1
Gand,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1
Paris.", 1
It, 1
is, 1
of, 1
course, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
resided, 1
in, 1
the, 1
aforesaid, 1
street,, 1
appeared, 1
every, 1
day, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fashionable, 1
walk,, 1
and, 1
dined, 1
frequently, 1
at, 1
the, 1
only, 1
restaurant, 1
where, 1
you, 1
can, 1
really, 1
dine,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
on, 1
good, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
its, 1
frequenters., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
musing, 1
over, 1
this, 1
answer,, 1
which, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
very, 1
clear., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
interrupting, 1
his, 1
host's, 1
meditations,, 1
"you, 1
had, 1
some, 1
motive, 1
for, 1
coming, 1
here,, 1
may, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
it, 1
was?", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
ordered, 1
your, 1
carriage, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
precisely?", 1
"I, 1
have.", 1
"You, 1
intend, 1
visiting, 1
Il, 1
Colosseo.", 1
"You, 1
mean, 1
the, 1
Colosseum?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing., 1
You, 1
have, 1
told, 1
your, 1
coachman, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
city, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
round, 1
the, 1
walls,, 1
and, 1
re-enter, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
San, 1
Giovanni?", 1
"These, 1
are, 1
my, 1
words, 1
exactly.", 1
"Well,, 1
this, 1
route, 1
is, 1
impossible.", 1
"Impossible!", 1
"Very, 1
dangerous,, 1
to, 1
say, 1
the, 1
least.", 1
"Dangerous!--and, 1
why?", 1
"On, 1
account, 1
of, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa.", 1
"Pray,, 1
who, 1
may, 1
this, 1
famous, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
be?", 1
inquired, 1
Albert;, 1
"he, 1
may, 1
be, 1
very, 1
famous, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
he, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
unknown, 1
at, 1
Paris.", 1
"What!, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
know, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
that, 1
honor.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"Never.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bandit,, 1
compared, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
Decesaris, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Gasparones, 1
were, 1
mere, 1
children.", 1
"Now, 1
then,, 1
Albert,", 1
cried, 1
Franz,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bandit, 1
for, 1
you, 1
at, 1
last.", 1
"I, 1
forewarn, 1
you,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
one, 1
word, 1
of, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
us;, 1
having, 1
told, 1
you, 1
this,, 1
begin.", 1
"Once, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
time"--, 1
"Well,, 1
go, 1
on.", 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
turned, 1
toward, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
more, 1
reasonable, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two;, 1
we, 1
must, 1
do, 1
him, 1
justice,--he, 1
had, 1
had, 1
a, 1
great, 1
many, 1
Frenchmen, 1
in, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
but, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
them., 1
"Excellency,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
gravely,, 1
addressing, 1
Franz,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
me, 1
as, 1
a, 1
liar,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
useless, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
say, 1
anything;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
your, 1
interest!"--, 1
"Albert, 1
does, 1
not, 1
say, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
liar,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
us,--but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
believe, 1
all, 1
you, 1
say;, 1
so, 1
proceed.", 1
"But, 1
if, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
doubt, 1
my, 1
veracity"--, 1
"Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
more, 1
susceptible, 1
than, 1
Cassandra,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
a, 1
prophetess,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
no, 1
one, 1
believed, 1
her;, 1
while, 1
you,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
are, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
credence, 1
of, 1
half, 1
your, 1
audience., 1
Come,, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
all, 1
about, 1
this, 1
Signor, 1
Vampa.", 1
"I, 1
had, 1
told, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
he, 1
is, 1
the, 1
most, 1
famous, 1
bandit, 1
we, 1
have, 1
had, 1
since, 1
the, 1
days, 1
of, 1
Mastrilla.", 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
has, 1
this, 1
bandit, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
the, 1
order, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
city, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
re-enter, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
San, 1
Giovanni?", 1
"This,", 1
replied, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
go, 1
out, 1
by, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
very, 1
much, 1
doubt, 1
your, 1
returning, 1
by, 1
the, 1
other.", 1
"Why?", 1
asked, 1
Franz., 1
"Because,, 1
after, 1
nightfall,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
safe, 1
fifty, 1
yards, 1
from, 1
the, 1
gates.", 1
"On, 1
your, 1
honor, 1
is, 1
that, 1
true?", 1
cried, 1
Albert., 1
"Count,", 1
returned, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
hurt, 1
at, 1
Albert's, 1
repeated, 1
doubts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
of, 1
his, 1
assertions,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
this, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
your, 1
companion,, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
Rome,, 1
and, 1
knows,, 1
too,, 1
that, 1
these, 1
things, 1
are, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
laughed, 1
at.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
an, 1
admirable, 1
adventure;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
fill, 1
our, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
pistols,, 1
blunderbusses,, 1
and, 1
double-barrelled, 1
guns., 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
comes, 1
to, 1
take, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
take, 1
him--we, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Rome,, 1
and, 1
present, 1
him, 1
to, 1
his, 1
holiness, 1
the, 1
Pope,, 1
who, 1
asks, 1
how, 1
he, 1
can, 1
repay, 1
so, 1
great, 1
a, 1
service;, 1
then, 1
we, 1
merely, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
horses,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
doubtless, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
people, 1
will, 1
crown, 1
us, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Capitol,, 1
and, 1
proclaim, 1
us,, 1
like, 1
Curtius, 1
and, 1
the, 1
veiled, 1
Horatius,, 1
the, 1
preservers, 1
of, 1
their, 1
country.", 1
Whilst, 1
Albert, 1
proposed, 1
this, 1
scheme,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini's, 1
face, 1
assumed, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe., 1
"And, 1
pray,", 1
asked, 1
Franz,, 1
"where, 1
are, 1
these, 1
pistols,, 1
blunderbusses,, 1
and, 1
other, 1
deadly, 1
weapons, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
filling, 1
the, 1
carriage?", 1
"Not, 1
out, 1
of, 1
my, 1
armory,, 1
for, 1
at, 1
Terracina, 1
I, 1
was, 1
plundered, 1
even, 1
of, 1
my, 1
hunting-knife.", 1
"I, 1
shared, 1
the, 1
same, 1
fate, 1
at, 1
Aquapendente.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
lighting, 1
a, 1
second, 1
cigar, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
"that, 1
this, 1
practice, 1
is, 1
very, 1
convenient, 1
for, 1
bandits,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
be, 1
due, 1
to, 1
an, 1
arrangement, 1
of, 1
their, 1
own.", 1
Doubtless, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
found, 1
this, 1
pleasantry, 1
compromising,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
only, 1
answered, 1
half, 1
the, 1
question,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
with, 1
attention., 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
knows, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
customary, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
yourself, 1
when, 1
attacked, 1
by, 1
bandits.", 1
"What!", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
whose, 1
courage, 1
revolted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
being, 1
plundered, 1
tamely,, 1
"not, 1
make, 1
any, 1
resistance!", 1
"No,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
useless., 1
What, 1
could, 1
you, 1
do, 1
against, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
bandits, 1
who, 1
spring, 1
out, 1
of, 1
some, 1
pit,, 1
ruin,, 1
or, 1
aqueduct,, 1
and, 1
level, 1
their, 1
pieces, 1
at, 1
you?", 1
"Eh,, 1
parbleu!--they, 1
should, 1
kill, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
inn-keeper, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"Your, 1
friend, 1
is, 1
decidedly, 1
mad.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"your, 1
answer, 1
is, 1
sublime,, 1
and, 1
worthy, 1
the, 1
'Let, 1
him, 1
die,', 1
of, 1
Corneille,, 1
only,, 1
when, 1
Horace, 1
made, 1
that, 1
answer,, 1
the, 1
safety, 1
of, 1

was, 1
concerned;, 1

as, 1
for, 1
us,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
to, 1
gratify, 1
a, 1
whim,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
ridiculous, 1
to, 1
risk, 1
our, 1
lives, 1
for, 1
so, 1
foolish, 1
a, 1
motive.", 1
Albert, 1
poured, 1
himself, 1
out, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
lacryma, 1
Christi,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
sipped, 1
at, 1
intervals,, 1
muttering, 1
some, 1
unintelligible, 1
words., 1
"Well,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"now, 1
that, 1
my, 1
companion, 1
is, 1
quieted,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
how, 1
peaceful, 1

me, 1

nobleman?--young, 1

him,, 1
in, 1
order, 1

we, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
by, 1
chance,, 1

Bugaboo, 1
John, 1

Lara,, 1

may, 1
recognize, 1
him.", 1
"You, 1
could, 1
not, 1
apply, 1

any, 1
one, 1
better, 1
able, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
you, 1
on, 1
all, 1

points,, 1

was, 1

one, 1
day, 1
that, 1

fell, 1
into, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
going, 1
from, 1
Ferentino, 1
to, 1
Alatri,, 1
he,, 1
fortunately, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
recollected, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
set, 1
me, 1
free,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
without, 1
ransom,, 1

made, 1
me, 1
a, 1
present, 1
of, 1
a, 1
very, 1
splendid, 1
watch,, 1

related, 1
his, 1
history, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
the, 1
watch,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
fob, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
Breguet,, 1
bearing, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
its, 1
maker,, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
manufacture,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
count's, 1
coronet., 1
"Here, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Peste,", 1
returned, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
compliment, 1
you, 1
on, 1
it;, 1

fellow"--he, 1
took, 1
his, 1
watch, 1
from, 1
his, 1
waistcoat, 1
pocket--"and, 1
it, 1
cost, 1
me, 1
3,000, 1
francs.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
history,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
motioning, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
to, 1
seat, 1
himself., 1
"Your, 1
excellencies, 1
permit, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
host., 1
"Pardieu!", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
a, 1
preacher,, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
standing!", 1
The, 1
host, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
made, 1
each, 1
of, 1
them, 1
a, 1
respectful, 1
bow,, 1
which, 1
meant, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
them, 1
all, 1
they, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
know, 1
concerning, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa., 1
"You, 1
tell, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
open, 1
his, 1
mouth,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
child--he, 1
is, 1
still, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
then?", 1
"A, 1
young, 1
man?, 1
he, 1
is, 1
only, 1
two, 1
and, 1
twenty;--he, 1
will, 1
gain, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
reputation.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
Albert?--at, 1
two, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
to, 1
be, 1
thus, 1
famous?", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
his, 1
age,, 1
Alexander,, 1
Caesar,, 1
and, 1
Napoleon,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
all, 1
made, 1
some, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
were, 1
quite, 1
behind, 1
him.", 1
"So,", 1
continued, 1
Franz,, 1
"the, 1
hero, 1
of, 1
this, 1
history, 1
is, 1
only, 1
two, 1
and, 1
twenty?", 1
"Scarcely, 1
so, 1
much.", 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
tall, 1
or, 1
short?", 1
"Of, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
height--about, 1
the, 1
same, 1
stature, 1
as, 1
his, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
host,, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
Albert., 1
"Thanks, 1
for, 1
the, 1
comparison,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bow., 1
"Go, 1
on,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
continued, 1
Franz,, 1
smiling, 1
at, 1
his, 1
friend's, 1
susceptibility., 1
"To, 1
what, 1
class, 1
of, 1
society, 1
does, 1
he, 1
belong?", 1
"He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
shepherd-boy, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
the, 1
farm, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice,, 1
situated, 1
between, 1
Palestrina, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lake, 1
of, 1
Gabri;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
born, 1
at, 1
Pampinara,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
service, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
five, 1
years, 1
old;, 1
his, 1
father, 1
was, 1
also, 1
a, 1
shepherd,, 1
who, 1
owned, 1
a, 1
small, 1
flock,, 1
and, 1
lived, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wool, 1
and, 1
the, 1
milk,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
sold, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
When, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
child,, 1
the, 1
little, 1
Vampa, 1
displayed, 1
a, 1
most, 1
extraordinary, 1
precocity., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
seven, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
the, 1
curate, 1
of, 1
Palestrina,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
to, 1
be, 1
taught, 1
to, 1
read;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
somewhat, 1
difficult,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
his, 1
flock;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
good, 1
curate, 1
went, 1
every, 1
day, 1
to, 1
say, 1
mass, 1
at, 1
a, 1
little, 1
hamlet, 1
too, 1
poor, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
a, 1
priest, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
having, 1
no, 1
other, 1
name,, 1
was, 1
called, 1
Borgo;, 1
he, 1
told, 1
Luigi, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
then, 1
he, 1
would, 1
give, 1
him, 1
a, 1
lesson,, 1
warning, 1
him, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
short,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
must, 1
profit, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
by, 1
it., 1
The, 1
child, 1
accepted, 1
joyfully., 1
Every, 1
day, 1
Luigi, 1
led, 1
his, 1
flock, 1
to, 1
graze, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
that, 1
leads, 1
from, 1
Palestrina, 1
to, 1
Borgo;, 1
every, 1
day,, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
and, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
on, 1
a, 1
bank, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wayside,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
little, 1
shepherd, 1
took, 1
his, 1
lesson, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
priest's, 1
breviary., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
three, 1
months, 1
he, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
to, 1
read., 1
This, 1
was, 1
not, 1
enough--he, 1
must, 1
now, 1
learn, 1
to, 1
write., 1
The, 1
priest, 1
had, 1
a, 1
writing, 1
teacher, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
make, 1
three, 1
alphabets--one, 1
large,, 1
one, 1
middling,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
small;, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
by, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sharp, 1
instrument, 1
he, 1
could, 1
trace, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
on, 1
a, 1
slate,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
learn, 1
to, 1
write., 1
The, 1
same, 1
evening,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
flock, 1
was, 1
safe, 1
at, 1
the, 1
farm,, 1
the, 1
little, 1
Luigi, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
smith, 1
at, 1
Palestrina,, 1
took, 1
a, 1
large, 1
nail,, 1
heated, 1
and, 1
sharpened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
stylus., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
gathered, 1
an, 1
armful, 1
of, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
slate, 1
and, 1
began., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
three, 1
months, 1
he, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
to, 1
write., 1
The, 1
curate,, 1
astonished, 1
at, 1
his, 1
quickness, 1
and, 1
intelligence,, 1
made, 1
him, 1
a, 1
present, 1
of, 1
pens,, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
penknife., 1
This, 1
demanded, 1
new, 1
effort,, 1
but, 1
nothing, 1
compared, 1
to, 1
the, 1
first;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
week, 1
he, 1
wrote, 1
as, 1
well, 1
with, 1
this, 1
pen, 1
as, 1
with, 1
the, 1
stylus., 1
The, 1
curate, 1
related, 1
the, 1
incident, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice,, 1
who, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
the, 1
little, 1
shepherd,, 1
made, 1
him, 1
read, 1
and, 1
write, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
attendant, 1
to, 1
let, 1
him, 1
eat, 1
with, 1
the, 1
domestics,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
two, 1
piastres, 1
a, 1
month., 1
With, 1
this,, 1
Luigi, 1
purchased, 1
books, 1
and, 1
pencils., 1
He, 1
applied, 1
his, 1
imitative, 1
powers, 1
to, 1
everything,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
Giotto,, 1
when, 1
young,, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
on, 1
his, 1
slate, 1
sheep,, 1
houses,, 1
and, 1
trees., 1
Then,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
knife,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
carve, 1
all, 1
sorts, 1
of, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
wood;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
that, 1
Pinelli,, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
sculptor,, 1
had, 1
commenced., 1
"A, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
six, 1
or, 1
seven--that, 1
is,, 1
a, 1
little, 1
younger, 1
than, 1
Vampa--tended, 1
sheep, 1
on, 1
a, 1
farm, 1
near, 1
Palestrina;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
an, 1
orphan,, 1
born, 1
at, 1
Valmontone, 1
and, 1
was, 1
named, 1
Teresa., 1
The, 1
two, 1
children, 1
met,, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
near, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
let, 1
their, 1
flocks, 1
mingle, 1
together,, 1
played,, 1
laughed,, 1
and, 1
conversed, 1
together;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
they, 1
separated, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice's, 1
flock, 1
from, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Baron, 1
Cervetri,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
children, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
their, 1
respective, 1
farms,, 1
promising, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
next, 1
morning., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
they, 1
kept, 1
their, 1
word,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
they, 1
grew, 1
up, 1
together., 1
Vampa, 1
was, 1
twelve,, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
eleven., 1
And, 1
yet, 1
their, 1
natural, 1
disposition, 1
revealed, 1
itself., 1
Beside, 1
his, 1
taste, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
arts,, 1
which, 1
Luigi, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could, 1
in, 1
his, 1
solitude,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
alternating, 1
fits, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1
and, 1
enthusiasm,, 1
was, 1
often, 1
angry, 1
and, 1
capricious,, 1
and, 1
always, 1
sarcastic., 1
None, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lads, 1
of, 1
Pampinara,, 1
Palestrina,, 1
or, 1
Valmontone, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
any, 1
influence, 1
over, 1
him, 1
or, 1
even, 1
to, 1
become, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
His, 1
disposition, 1
(always, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
exact, 1
concessions, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
to, 1
make, 1
them), 1
kept, 1
him, 1
aloof, 1
from, 1
all, 1
friendships., 1
Teresa, 1
alone, 1
ruled, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look,, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
a, 1
gesture,, 1
this, 1
impetuous, 1
character,, 1
which, 1
yielded, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
might, 1
have, 1
broken,, 1
but, 1
could, 1
never, 1
have, 1
been, 1
bended., 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
lively, 1
and, 1
gay,, 1
but, 1
coquettish, 1
to, 1
excess., 1
The, 1
two, 1
piastres, 1
that, 1
Luigi, 1
received, 1
every, 1
month, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice's, 1
steward,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
price, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
little, 1
carvings, 1
in, 1
wood, 1
he, 1
sold, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
were, 1
expended, 1
in, 1
ear-rings,, 1
necklaces,, 1
and, 1
gold, 1
hairpins., 1
So, 1
that,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
her, 1
friend's, 1
generosity,, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
the, 1
most, 1
beautiful, 1
and, 1
the, 1
best-attired, 1
peasant, 1
near, 1
Rome., 1
The, 1
two, 1
children, 1
grew, 1
up, 1
together,, 1
passing, 1
all, 1
their, 1
time, 1
with, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
giving, 1
themselves, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
ideas, 1
of, 1
their, 1
different, 1
characters., 1
Thus,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
their, 1
dreams,, 1
their, 1
wishes,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
conversations,, 1
Vampa, 1
saw, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
a, 1
vessel,, 1
general, 1
of, 1
an, 1
army,, 1
or, 1
governor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
province., 1
Teresa, 1
saw, 1
herself, 1
rich,, 1
superbly, 1
attired,, 1
and, 1
attended, 1
by, 1
a, 1
train, 1
of, 1
liveried, 1
domestics., 1
Then,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
had, 1
thus, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
day, 1
in, 1
building, 1
castles, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
they, 1
separated, 1
their, 1
flocks,, 1
and, 1
descended, 1
from, 1
the, 1
elevation, 1
of, 1
their, 1
dreams, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reality, 1
of, 1
their, 1
humble, 1
position., 1
"One, 1
day, 1
the, 1
young, 1
shepherd, 1
told, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
steward, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
a, 1
wolf, 1
come, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Sabine, 1
mountains,, 1
and, 1
prowl, 1
around, 1
his, 1
flock., 1
The, 1
steward, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
a, 1
gun;, 1
this, 1
was, 1
what, 1
Vampa, 1
longed, 1
for., 1
This, 1
gun, 1
had, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
barrel,, 1
made, 1
at, 1
Breschia,, 1
and, 1
carrying, 1
a, 1
ball, 1
with, 1
the, 1
precision, 1
of, 1
an, 1
English, 1
rifle;, 1
but, 1
one, 1
day, 1
the, 1
count, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
stock,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
then, 1
cast, 1
the, 1
gun, 1
aside., 1
This,, 1
however,, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sculptor, 1
like, 1
Vampa;, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
stock,, 1
calculated, 1
what, 1
change, 1
it, 1
would, 1
require, 1
to, 1
adapt, 1
the, 1
gun, 1
to, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
stock,, 1
so, 1
beautifully, 1
carved, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
fetched, 1
fifteen, 1
or, 1
twenty, 1
piastres,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
chosen, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
it., 1
But, 1
nothing, 1
could, 1
be, 1
farther, 1
from, 1
his, 1
thoughts., 1
For, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
a, 1
gun, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
greatest, 1
ambition., 1
In, 1
every, 1
country, 1
where, 1
independence, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
liberty,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
desire, 1
of, 1
a, 1
manly, 1
heart, 1
is, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
weapon,, 1
which, 1
at, 1
once, 1
renders, 1
him, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
defence, 1
or, 1
attack,, 1
and,, 1
by, 1
rendering, 1
its, 1
owner, 1
terrible,, 1
often, 1
makes, 1
him, 1
feared., 1
From, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Vampa, 1
devoted, 1
all, 1
his, 1
leisure, 1
time, 1
to, 1
perfecting, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
his, 1
precious, 1
weapon;, 1
he, 1
purchased, 1
powder, 1
and, 1
ball,, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
served, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
mark--the, 1
trunk, 1
of, 1
some, 1
old, 1
and, 1
moss-grown, 1
olivetree,, 1
that, 1
grew, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Sabine, 1
mountains;, 1
the, 1
fox,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
his, 1
earth, 1
on, 1
some, 1
marauding, 1
excursion;, 1
the, 1
eagle, 1
that, 1
soared, 1
above, 1
their, 1
heads:, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
became, 1
so, 1
expert,, 1
that, 1
Teresa, 1
overcame, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
she, 1
at, 1
first, 1
felt, 1
at, 1
the, 1
report,, 1
and, 1
amused, 1
herself, 1
by, 1
watching, 1
him, 1
direct, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
wherever, 1
he, 1
pleased,, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
accuracy, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
by, 1
hand., 1
"One, 1
evening, 1
a, 1
wolf, 1
emerged, 1
from, 1
a, 1
pine-wood, 1
near, 1
which, 1
they, 1
were, 1
usually, 1
stationed,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
wolf, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
advanced, 1
ten, 1
yards, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
Proud, 1
of, 1
this, 1
exploit,, 1
Vampa, 1
took, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
animal, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulders,, 1
and, 1
carried, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
farm., 1
These, 1
exploits, 1
had, 1
gained, 1
Luigi, 1
considerable, 1
reputation., 1
The, 1
man, 1
of, 1
superior, 1
abilities, 1
always, 1
finds, 1
admirers,, 1
go, 1
where, 1
he, 1
will., 1
He, 1
was, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
as, 1
the, 1
most, 1
adroit,, 1
the, 1
strongest,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1
courageous, 1
contadino, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
leagues, 1
around;, 1
and, 1
although, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
universally, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
most, 1
beautiful, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Sabines,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
her, 1
of, 1
love,, 1
because, 1
it, 1
was, 1
known, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
beloved, 1
by, 1
Vampa., 1
And, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
people, 1
had, 1
never, 1
declared, 1
their, 1
affection;, 1
they, 1
had, 1
grown, 1
together, 1
like, 1
two, 1
trees, 1
whose, 1
roots, 1
are, 1
mingled,, 1
whose, 1
branches, 1
intertwined,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
intermingled, 1
perfume, 1
rises, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heavens., 1
Only, 1
their, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
each, 1
other, 1
had, 1
become, 1
a, 1
necessity,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
preferred, 1
death, 1
to, 1
a, 1
day's, 1
separation., 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
sixteen,, 1
and, 1
Vampa, 1
seventeen., 1
About, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
a, 1
band, 1
of, 1
brigands, 1
that, 1
had, 1
established, 1
itself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Lepini, 1
mountains, 1
began, 1
to, 1
be, 1
much, 1
spoken, 1
of., 1
The, 1
brigands, 1
have, 1
never, 1
been, 1
really, 1
extirpated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
Rome., 1
Sometimes, 1
a, 1
chief, 1
is, 1
wanted,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
a, 1
chief, 1
presents, 1
himself, 1
he, 1
rarely, 1
has, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
long, 1
for, 1
a, 1
band, 1
of, 1
followers., 1
"The, 1
celebrated, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
pursued, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Abruzzo,, 1
driven, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kingdom, 1
of, 1
Naples,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
on, 1
a, 1
regular, 1
war,, 1
had, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
Garigliano,, 1
like, 1
Manfred,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
refuge, 1
on, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Amasine, 1
between, 1
Sonnino, 1
and, 1
Juperno., 1
He, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
a, 1
band, 1
of, 1
followers,, 1
and, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
footsteps, 1
of, 1
Decesaris, 1
and, 1
Gasperone,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
surpass., 1
Many, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
Palestrina,, 1
Frascati,, 1
and, 1
Pampinara, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
Their, 1
disappearance, 1
at, 1
first, 1
caused, 1
much, 1
disquietude;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
known, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
joined, 1
Cucumetto., 1
After, 1
some, 1
time, 1
Cucumetto, 1
became, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
universal, 1
attention;, 1
the, 1
most, 1
extraordinary, 1
traits, 1
of, 1
ferocious, 1
daring, 1
and, 1
brutality, 1
were, 1
related, 1
of, 1
him., 1
One, 1
day, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
surveyor, 1
of, 1
Frosinone., 1
The, 1
bandit's, 1
laws, 1
are, 1
positive;, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
belongs, 1
first, 1
to, 1
him, 1
who, 1
carries, 1
her, 1
off,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
draw, 1
lots, 1
for, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
is, 1
abandoned, 1
to, 1
their, 1
brutality, 1
until, 1
death, 1
relieves, 1
her, 1
sufferings., 1
When, 1
their, 1
parents, 1
are, 1
sufficiently, 1
rich, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
a, 1
ransom,, 1
a, 1
messenger, 1
is, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
negotiate;, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
is, 1
hostage, 1
for, 1
the, 1
security, 1
of, 1
the, 1
messenger;, 1
should, 1
the, 1
ransom, 1
be, 1
refused,, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
is, 1
irrevocably, 1
lost., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
lover, 1
was, 1
in, 1
Cucumetto's, 1
troop;, 1
his, 1
name, 1
was, 1
Carlini., 1
When, 1
she, 1
recognized, 1
her, 1
lover,, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
girl, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
believed, 1
herself, 1
safe;, 1
but, 1
Carlini, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
sink,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
but, 1
too, 1
well, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
fate, 1
that, 1
awaited, 1
her., 1
However,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
favorite, 1
with, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
for, 1
three, 1
years, 1
faithfully, 1
served, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
saved, 1
his, 1
life, 1
by, 1
shooting, 1
a, 1
dragoon, 1
who, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
him, 1
down,, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
would, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
him., 1
He, 1
took, 1
Cucumetto, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
huge, 1
pine, 1
that, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
veil, 1
of, 1
her, 1
picturesque, 1
head-dress, 1
to, 1
hide, 1
her, 1
face, 1
from, 1
the, 1
lascivious, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandits., 1
There, 1
he, 1
told, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
all--his, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
their, 1
promises, 1
of, 1
mutual, 1
fidelity,, 1
and, 1
how, 1
every, 1
night,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
near,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
met, 1
in, 1
some, 1
neighboring, 1
ruins., 1
"It, 1
so, 1
happened, 1
that, 1
night, 1
that, 1
Cucumetto, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
Carlini, 1
to, 1
a, 1
village,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
meeting., 1
Cucumetto, 1
had, 1
been, 1
there,, 1
however,, 1
by, 1
accident,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
maiden, 1
off., 1
Carlini, 1
besought, 1
his, 1
chief, 1
to, 1
make, 1
an, 1
exception, 1
in, 1
Rita's, 1
favor,, 1
as, 1
her, 1
father, 1
was, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
could, 1
pay, 1
a, 1
large, 1
ransom., 1
Cucumetto, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend's, 1
entreaties,, 1
and, 1
bade, 1
him, 1
find, 1
a, 1
shepherd, 1
to, 1
send, 1
to, 1
Rita's, 1
father, 1
at, 1
Frosinone., 1
Carlini, 1
flew, 1
joyfully, 1
to, 1
Rita,, 1
telling, 1
her, 1
she, 1
was, 1
saved,, 1
and, 1
bidding, 1
her, 1
write, 1
to, 1
her, 1
father,, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
him, 1
what, 1
had, 1
occurred,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
her, 1
ransom, 1
was, 1
fixed, 1
at, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
piastres., 1
Twelve, 1
hours', 1
delay, 1
was, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
granted--that, 1
is,, 1
until, 1
nine, 1
the, 1
next, 1
morning., 1
The, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
was, 1
written,, 1
Carlini, 1
seized, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
plain, 1
to, 1
find, 1
a, 1
messenger., 1
He, 1
found, 1
a, 1
young, 1
shepherd, 1
watching, 1
his, 1
flock., 1
The, 1
natural, 1
messengers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
are, 1
the, 1
shepherds, 1
who, 1
live, 1
between, 1
the, 1
city, 1
and, 1
the, 1
mountains,, 1
between, 1
civilized, 1
and, 1
savage, 1
life., 1
The, 1
boy, 1
undertook, 1
the, 1
commission,, 1
promising, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
Frosinone, 1
in, 1
less, 1
than, 1
an, 1
hour., 1
Carlini, 1
returned,, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
mistress,, 1
and, 1
announce, 1
the, 1
joyful, 1
intelligence., 1
He, 1
found, 1
the, 1
troop, 1
in, 1
the, 1
glade,, 1
supping, 1
off, 1
the, 1
provisions, 1
exacted, 1
as, 1
contributions, 1
from, 1
the, 1
peasants;, 1
but, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
vainly, 1
sought, 1
Rita, 1
and, 1
Cucumetto, 1
among, 1
them., 1
He, 1
inquired, 1
where, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
a, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
laughter., 1
A, 1
cold, 1
perspiration, 1
burst, 1
from, 1
every, 1
pore,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
stood, 1
on, 1
end., 1
He, 1
repeated, 1
his, 1
question., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
Orvietto,, 1
saying,, 1
'To, 1
the, 1
health, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brave, 1
Cucumetto, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
Rita.', 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Carlini, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
woman's, 1
cry;, 1
he, 1
divined, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
broke, 1
it, 1
across, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
him, 1
who, 1
presented, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
whence, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
came., 1
After, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
yards, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thicket;, 1
he, 1
found, 1
Rita, 1
senseless, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
Cucumetto., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Carlini,, 1
Cucumetto, 1
rose,, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
in, 1
each, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
two, 1
brigands, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment--the, 1
one, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
lasciviousness, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pallor, 1
of, 1
death, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
A, 1
terrible, 1
battle, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men, 1
seemed, 1
imminent;, 1
but, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
Carlini's, 1
features, 1
relaxed,, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
grasped, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pistols, 1
in, 1
his, 1
belt,, 1
fell, 1
to, 1
his, 1
side., 1
Rita, 1
lay, 1
between, 1
them., 1
The, 1
moon, 1
lighted, 1
the, 1
group., 1
"'Well,', 1
said, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
'have, 1
you, 1
executed, 1
your, 1
commission?', 1
"'Yes,, 1
captain,', 1
returned, 1
Carlini., 1
'At, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
to-morrow, 1
Rita's, 1
father, 1
will, 1
be, 1
here, 1
with, 1
the, 1
money.'--'It, 1
is, 1
well;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
meantime,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
have, 1
a, 1
merry, 1
night;, 1
this, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
is, 1
charming,, 1
and, 1
does, 1
credit, 1
to, 1
your, 1
taste., 1
Now,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
egotistical,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
return, 1
to, 1
our, 1
comrades, 1
and, 1
draw, 1
lots, 1
for, 1
her.'--'You, 1
have, 1
determined,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
abandon, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
common, 1
law?', 1
said, 1
Carlini., 1
"'Why, 1
should, 1
an, 1
exception, 1
be, 1
made, 1
in, 1
her, 1
favor?', 1
"'I, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
my, 1
entreaties'--, 1
"'What, 1
right, 1
have, 1
you,, 1
any, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
an, 1
exception?'--'It, 1
is, 1
true.'--'But, 1
never, 1
mind,', 1
continued, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
laughing,, 1
'sooner, 1
or, 1
later, 1
your, 1
turn, 1
will, 1
come.', 1
Carlini's, 1
teeth, 1
clinched, 1
convulsively., 1
"'Now,, 1
then,', 1
said, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
other, 1
bandits,, 1
'are, 1
you, 1
coming?'--'I, 1
follow, 1
you.', 1
"Cucumetto, 1
departed,, 1
without, 1
losing, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Carlini,, 1
for,, 1
doubtless,, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
lest, 1
he, 1
should, 1
strike, 1
him, 1
unawares;, 1
but, 1
nothing, 1
betrayed, 1
a, 1
hostile, 1
design, 1
on, 1
Carlini's, 1
part., 1
He, 1
was, 1
standing,, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
folded,, 1
near, 1
Rita,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
still, 1
insensible., 1
Cucumetto, 1
fancied, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
take, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
fly;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
mattered, 1
little, 1
to, 1
him, 1
now, 1
Rita, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
for, 1
the, 1
money,, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
piastres, 1
distributed, 1
among, 1
the, 1
band, 1
was, 1
so, 1
small, 1
a, 1
sum, 1
that, 1
he, 1
cared, 1
little, 1
about, 1
it., 1
He, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
the, 1
path, 1
to, 1
the, 1
glade;, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
great, 1
surprise,, 1
Carlini, 1
arrived, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
himself., 1
'Let, 1
us, 1
draw, 1
lots!, 1
let, 1
us, 1
draw, 1
lots!', 1
cried, 1
all, 1
the, 1
brigands,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
chief., 1
"Their, 1
demand, 1
was, 1
fair,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
inclined, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
acquiescence., 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
all, 1
shone, 1
fiercely, 1
as, 1
they, 1
made, 1
their, 1
demand,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
red, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
made, 1
them, 1
look, 1
like, 1
demons., 1
The, 1
names, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
including, 1
Carlini,, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hat,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
youngest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
band, 1
drew, 1
forth, 1
a, 1
ticket;, 1
the, 1
ticket, 1
bore, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Diovolaccio., 1
He, 1
was, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
Carlini, 1
the, 1
health, 1
of, 1
their, 1
chief,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
Carlini, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
breaking, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
across, 1
his, 1
face., 1
A, 1
large, 1
wound,, 1
extending, 1
from, 1
the, 1
temple, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mouth,, 1
was, 1
bleeding, 1
profusely., 1
Diovalaccio,, 1
seeing, 1
himself, 1
thus, 1
favored, 1
by, 1
fortune,, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
laugh., 1
'Captain,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'just, 1
now, 1
Carlini, 1
would, 1
not, 1
drink, 1
your, 1
health, 1
when, 1
I, 1
proposed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
propose, 1
mine, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
if, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
more, 1
condescending, 1
to, 1
you, 1
than, 1
to, 1
me.', 1
Every, 1
one, 1
expected, 1
an, 1
explosion, 1
on, 1
Carlini's, 1
part;, 1
but, 1
to, 1
their, 1
great, 1
surprise,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
a, 1
flask, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
filling, 1
it,--'Your, 1
health,, 1
Diavolaccio,', 1
said, 1
he, 1
calmly,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
drank, 1
it, 1
off,, 1
without, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
trembling, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least., 1
Then, 1
sitting, 1
down, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
'My, 1
supper,', 1
said, 1
he;, 1
'my, 1
expedition, 1
has, 1
given, 1
me, 1
an, 1
appetite.'--'Well, 1
done,, 1
Carlini!', 1
cried, 1
the, 1
brigands;, 1
'that, 1
is, 1
acting, 1
like, 1
a, 1
good, 1
fellow;', 1
and, 1
they, 1
all, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
circle, 1
round, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
while, 1
Diavolaccio, 1
disappeared., 1
Carlini, 1
ate, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
as, 1
if, 1
nothing, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
The, 1
bandits, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
this, 1
singular, 1
conduct, 1
until, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
footsteps., 1
They, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Diavolaccio, 1
bearing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
Her, 1
head, 1
hung, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
long, 1
hair, 1
swept, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
As, 1
they, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
circle,, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
could, 1
perceive,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
firelight,, 1
the, 1
unearthly, 1
pallor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
and, 1
of, 1
Diavolaccio., 1
This, 1
apparition, 1
was, 1
so, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
so, 1
solemn,, 1
that, 1
every, 1
one, 1
rose,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
Carlini,, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
seated,, 1
and, 1
ate, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
calmly., 1
Diavolaccio, 1
advanced, 1
amidst, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
laid, 1
Rita, 1
at, 1
the, 1
captain's, 1
feet., 1
Then, 1
every, 1
one, 1
could, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
unearthly, 1
pallor, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
and, 1
the, 1
bandit., 1
A, 1
knife, 1
was, 1
plunged, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hilt, 1
in, 1
Rita's, 1
left, 1
breast., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Carlini;, 1
the, 1
sheath, 1
at, 1
his, 1
belt, 1
was, 1
empty., 1
'Ah,, 1
ah,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
'I, 1
now, 1
understand, 1
why, 1
Carlini, 1
stayed, 1
behind.', 1
All, 1
savage, 1
natures, 1
appreciate, 1
a, 1
desperate, 1
deed., 1
No, 1
other, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
would,, 1
perhaps,, 1
have, 1
done, 1
the, 1
same;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
all, 1
understood, 1
what, 1
Carlini, 1
had, 1
done., 1
'Now,, 1
then,', 1
cried, 1
Carlini,, 1
rising, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
butt, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pistols,, 1
'does, 1
any, 1
one, 1
dispute, 1
the, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
this, 1
woman, 1
with, 1
me?'--'No,', 1
returned, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
'she, 1
is, 1
thine.', 1
Carlini, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
carried, 1
her, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circle, 1
of, 1
firelight., 1
Cucumetto, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
sentinels, 1
for, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
wrapped, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
their, 1
cloaks,, 1
and, 1
lay, 1
down, 1
before, 1
the, 1
fire., 1
At, 1
midnight, 1
the, 1
sentinel, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
alarm,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
all, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
alert., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Rita's, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
brought, 1
his, 1
daughter's, 1
ransom, 1
in, 1
person., 1
'Here,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
to, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
'here, 1
are, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
piastres;, 1
give, 1
me, 1
back, 1
my, 1
child., 1
But, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
without, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
money,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
follow., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
obeyed., 1
They, 1
both, 1
advanced, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
through, 1
whose, 1
branches, 1
streamed, 1
the, 1
moonlight., 1
Cucumetto, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
last,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
grouped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tree., 1
"'There,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'demand, 1
thy, 1
child, 1
of, 1
Carlini;, 1
he, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
thee, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
her;', 1
and, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companions., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
remained, 1
motionless;, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
some, 1
great, 1
and, 1
unforeseen, 1
misfortune, 1
hung, 1
over, 1
his, 1
head., 1
At, 1
length, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
group,, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
comprehend., 1
As, 1
he, 1
approached,, 1
Carlini, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
forms, 1
of, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
became, 1
visible, 1
to, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes., 1
A, 1
woman, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
her, 1
head, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
knees, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
by, 1
her;, 1
as, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
the, 1
woman's, 1
face, 1
became, 1
visible., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
recognized, 1
his, 1
child,, 1
and, 1
Carlini, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
'I, 1
expected, 1
thee,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
to, 1
Rita's, 1
father.--'Wretch!', 1
returned, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
'what, 1
hast, 1
thou, 1
done?', 1
and, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
with, 1
terror, 1
on, 1
Rita,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
bloody,, 1
a, 1
knife, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
her, 1
bosom., 1
A, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
moonlight, 1
poured, 1
through, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead.--'Cucumetto, 1
had, 1
violated, 1
thy, 1
daughter,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
bandit;, 1
'I, 1
loved, 1
her,, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
slew, 1
her;, 1
for, 1
she, 1
would, 1
have, 1
served, 1
as, 1
the, 1
sport, 1
of, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
band.', 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
spoke, 1
not,, 1
and, 1
grew, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
death., 1
'Now,', 1
continued, 1
Carlini,, 1
'if, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done, 1
wrongly,, 1
avenge, 1
her;', 1
and, 1
withdrawing, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wound, 1
in, 1
Rita's, 1
bosom,, 1
he, 1
held, 1
it, 1
out, 1
to, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
he, 1
tore, 1
open, 1
his, 1
vest.--'Thou, 1
hast, 1
done, 1
well!', 1
returned, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice;, 1
'embrace, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
son.', 1
Carlini, 1
threw, 1
himself,, 1
sobbing, 1
like, 1
a, 1
child,, 1
into, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mistress's, 1
father., 1
These, 1
were, 1
the, 1
first, 1
tears, 1
the, 1
man, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
wept., 1
'Now,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
'aid, 1
me, 1
to, 1
bury, 1
my, 1
child.', 1
Carlini, 1
fetched, 1
two, 1
pickaxes;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
father, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lover, 1
began, 1
to, 1
dig, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
huge, 1
oak,, 1
beneath, 1
which, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
was, 1
to, 1
repose., 1
When, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
was, 1
formed,, 1
the, 1
father, 1
kissed, 1
her, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
lover;, 1
afterwards,, 1
one, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
the, 1
feet,, 1
they, 1
placed, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grave., 1
Then, 1
they, 1
knelt, 1
on, 1
each, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grave,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
the, 1
prayers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead., 1
Then,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
they, 1
cast, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
over, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
until, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
was, 1
filled., 1
Then,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
said;, 1
'I, 1
thank, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
son;, 1
and, 1
now, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
alone.'--'Yet'--replied, 1
Carlini.--'Leave, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
command, 1
you.', 1
Carlini, 1
obeyed,, 1
rejoined, 1
his, 1
comrades,, 1
folded, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cloak,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
as, 1
soundly, 1
as, 1
the, 1
rest., 1
It, 1
had, 1
been, 1
resolved, 1
the, 1
night, 1
before, 1
to, 1
change, 1
their, 1
encampment., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
before, 1
daybreak,, 1
Cucumetto, 1
aroused, 1
his, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
word, 1
to, 1
march., 1
But, 1
Carlini, 1
would, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
without, 1
knowing, 1
what, 1
had, 1
become, 1
of, 1
Rita's, 1
father., 1
He, 1
went, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
place, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him., 1
He, 1
found, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
suspended, 1
from, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oak, 1
which, 1
shaded, 1
his, 1
daughter's, 1
grave., 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
an, 1
oath, 1
of, 1
bitter, 1
vengeance, 1
over, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
body, 1
of, 1
the, 1
one, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tomb, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other., 1
But, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
this, 1
oath,, 1
for, 1
two, 1
days, 1
afterwards,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
encounter, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
carbineers,, 1
Carlini, 1
was, 1
killed., 1
There, 1
was, 1
some, 1
surprise,, 1
however,, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
with, 1
his, 1
face, 1
to, 1
the, 1
enemy,, 1
he, 1
should, 1
have, 1
received, 1
a, 1
ball, 1
between, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
That, 1
astonishment, 1
ceased, 1
when, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brigands, 1
remarked, 1
to, 1
his, 1
comrades, 1
that, 1
Cucumetto, 1
was, 1
stationed, 1
ten, 1
paces, 1
in, 1
Carlini's, 1
rear, 1
when, 1
he, 1
fell., 1
On, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
departure, 1
from, 1
the, 1
forest, 1
of, 1
Frosinone, 1
he, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
Carlini, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
this, 1
oath, 1
of, 1
vengeance,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wise, 1
man,, 1
anticipated, 1
it., 1
They, 1
told, 1
ten, 1
other, 1
stories, 1
of, 1
this, 1
bandit, 1
chief,, 1
each, 1
more, 1
singular, 1
than, 1
the, 1
other., 1
Thus,, 1
from, 1
Fondi, 1
to, 1
Perusia,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
trembles, 1
at, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Cucumetto., 1
"These, 1
narratives, 1
were, 1
frequently, 1
the, 1
theme, 1
of, 1
conversation, 1
between, 1
Luigi, 1
and, 1
Teresa., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
trembled, 1
very, 1
much, 1
at, 1
hearing, 1
the, 1
stories;, 1
but, 1
Vampa, 1
reassured, 1
her, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
tapping, 1
the, 1
butt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
good, 1
fowling-piece,, 1
which, 1
threw, 1
its, 1
ball, 1
so, 1
well;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
that, 1
did, 1
not, 1
restore, 1
her, 1
courage,, 1
he, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
crow,, 1
perched, 1
on, 1
some, 1
dead, 1
branch,, 1
took, 1
aim,, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
trigger,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
bird, 1
fell, 1
dead, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tree., 1
Time, 1
passed, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
people, 1
had, 1
agreed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married, 1
when, 1
Vampa, 1
should, 1
be, 1
twenty, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
nineteen, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age., 1
They, 1
were, 1
both, 1
orphans,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
only, 1
their, 1
employers', 1
leave, 1
to, 1
ask,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
already, 1
sought, 1
and, 1
obtained., 1
One, 1
day, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
talking, 1
over, 1
their, 1
plans, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future,, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
reports, 1
of, 1
firearms,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
suddenly, 1
a, 1
man, 1
came, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wood,, 1
near, 1
which, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
persons, 1
used, 1
to, 1
graze, 1
their, 1
flocks,, 1
and, 1
hurried, 1
towards, 1
them., 1
When, 1
he, 1
came, 1
within, 1
hearing,, 1
he, 1
exclaimed., 1
'I, 1
am, 1
pursued;, 1
can, 1
you, 1
conceal, 1
me?', 1
They, 1
knew, 1
full, 1
well, 1
that, 1
this, 1
fugitive, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
bandit;, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
an, 1
innate, 1
sympathy, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
brigand, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
peasant, 1
and, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
is, 1
always, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
aid, 1
the, 1
former., 1
Vampa,, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
that, 1
closed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
their, 1
grotto,, 1
drew, 1
it, 1
away,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fugitive, 1
to, 1
take, 1
refuge, 1
there,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
retreat, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
upon, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
and, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
by, 1
Teresa., 1
Instantly, 1
afterwards, 1
four, 1
carbineers,, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wood;, 1
three, 1
of, 1
them, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fugitive,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
dragged, 1
a, 1
brigand, 1
prisoner, 1
by, 1
the, 1
neck., 1
The, 1
three, 1
carbineers, 1
looked, 1
about, 1
carefully, 1
on, 1
every, 1
side,, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
young, 1
peasants,, 1
and, 1
galloping, 1
up,, 1
began, 1
to, 1
question, 1
them., 1
They, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
no, 1
one., 1
'That, 1
is, 1
very, 1
annoying,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
man, 1
we, 1
are, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
is, 1
the, 1
chief.'--'Cucumetto?', 1
cried, 1
Luigi, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment., 1
"'Yes,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
brigadier;, 1
'and, 1
as, 1
his, 1
head, 1
is, 1
valued, 1
at, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
Roman, 1
crowns,, 1
there, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
helped, 1
us, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
him.', 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
persons, 1
exchanged, 1
looks., 1
The, 1
brigadier, 1
had, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
hope., 1
Five, 1
hundred, 1
Roman, 1
crowns, 1
are, 1
three, 1
thousand, 1
lire,, 1
and, 1
three, 1
thousand, 1
lire, 1
are, 1
a, 1
fortune, 1
for, 1
two, 1
poor, 1
orphans, 1
who, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married., 1
"'Yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
annoying,', 1
said, 1
Vampa;, 1
'but, 1
we, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
him.', 1
"Then, 1
the, 1
carbineers, 1
scoured, 1
the, 1
country, 1
in, 1
different, 1
directions,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
vain;, 1
then,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
time,, 1
they, 1
disappeared., 1
Vampa, 1
then, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
and, 1
Cucumetto, 1
came, 1
out., 1
Through, 1
the, 1
crevices, 1
in, 1
the, 1
granite, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
peasants, 1
talking, 1
with, 1
the, 1
carbineers,, 1
and, 1
guessed, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
their, 1
parley., 1
He, 1
had, 1
read, 1
in, 1
the, 1
countenances, 1
of, 1
Luigi, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
their, 1
steadfast, 1
resolution, 1
not, 1
to, 1
surrender, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
purse, 1
full, 1
of, 1
gold,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
them., 1
But, 1
Vampa, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
proudly;, 1
as, 1
to, 1
Teresa,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
when, 1
she, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
gowns, 1
and, 1
gay, 1
jewellery, 1
she, 1
could, 1
buy, 1
with, 1
this, 1
purse, 1
of, 1
gold., 1
"Cucumetto, 1
was, 1
a, 1
cunning, 1
fiend,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
form, 1
of, 1
a, 1
brigand, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
a, 1
serpent,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
look, 1
from, 1
Teresa, 1
showed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
Eve,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
pausing, 1
several, 1
times, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
pretext, 1
of, 1
saluting, 1
his, 1
protectors., 1
Several, 1
days, 1
elapsed,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
neither, 1
saw, 1
nor, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
Cucumetto., 1
The, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
was, 1
at, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice, 1
announced, 1
a, 1
grand, 1
masked, 1
ball,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
all, 1
that, 1
were, 1
distinguished, 1
in, 1
Rome, 1
were, 1
invited., 1
Teresa, 1
had, 1
a, 1
great, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
see, 1
this, 1
ball., 1
Luigi, 1
asked, 1
permission, 1
of, 1
his, 1
protector,, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
and, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
present, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
This, 1
was, 1
granted., 1
The, 1
ball, 1
was, 1
given, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
for, 1
the, 1
particular, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
Carmela,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
adored., 1
Carmela, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1
the, 1
age, 1
and, 1
figure, 1
of, 1
Teresa,, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
as, 1
handsome, 1
as, 1
Carmela., 1
On, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
attired, 1
in, 1
her, 1
best,, 1
her, 1
most, 1
brilliant, 1
ornaments, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
gayest, 1
glass, 1
beads,--she, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
Frascati., 1
Luigi, 1
wore, 1
the, 1
very, 1
picturesque, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
peasant, 1
at, 1
holiday, 1
time., 1
They, 1
both, 1
mingled,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
had, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
and, 1
peasants., 1
"The, 1
festa, 1
was, 1
magnificent;, 1
not, 1
only, 1
was, 1
the, 1
villa, 1
brilliantly, 1
illuminated,, 1
but, 1
thousands, 1
of, 1
colored, 1
lanterns, 1
were, 1
suspended, 1
from, 1
the, 1
trees, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden;, 1
and, 1
very, 1
soon, 1
the, 1
palace, 1
overflowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
terraces,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
terraces, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden-walks., 1
At, 1
each, 1
cross-path, 1
was, 1
an, 1
orchestra,, 1
and, 1
tables, 1
spread, 1
with, 1
refreshments;, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
stopped,, 1
formed, 1
quadrilles,, 1
and, 1
danced, 1
in, 1
any, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grounds, 1
they, 1
pleased., 1
Carmela, 1
was, 1
attired, 1
like, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
Sonnino., 1
Her, 1
cap, 1
was, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
pearls,, 1
the, 1
pins, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hair, 1
were, 1
of, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
diamonds,, 1
her, 1
girdle, 1
was, 1
of, 1
Turkey, 1
silk,, 1
with, 1
large, 1
embroidered, 1
flowers,, 1
her, 1
bodice, 1
and, 1
skirt, 1
were, 1
of, 1
cashmere,, 1
her, 1
apron, 1
of, 1
Indian, 1
muslin,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
buttons, 1
of, 1
her, 1
corset, 1
were, 1
of, 1
jewels., 1
Two, 1
of, 1
her, 1
companions, 1
were, 1
dressed,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
as, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
Nettuno,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
as, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Riccia., 1
Four, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
richest, 1
and, 1
noblest, 1
families, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1
accompanied, 1
them, 1
with, 1
that, 1
Italian, 1
freedom, 1
which, 1
has, 1
not, 1
its, 1
parallel, 1
in, 1
any, 1
other, 1
country, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
They, 1
were, 1
attired, 1
as, 1
peasants, 1
of, 1
Albano,, 1
Velletri,, 1
Civita-Castellana,, 1
and, 1
Sora., 1
We, 1
need, 1
hardly, 1
add, 1
that, 1
these, 1
peasant, 1
costumes,, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
women,, 1
were, 1
brilliant, 1
with, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
jewels., 1
"Carmela, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
form, 1
a, 1
quadrille,, 1
but, 1
there, 1
was, 1
one, 1
lady, 1
wanting., 1
Carmela, 1
looked, 1
all, 1
around, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
had, 1
a, 1
costume, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
her, 1
own,, 1
or, 1
those, 1
of, 1
her, 1
companions., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
Teresa,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
hanging, 1
on, 1
Luigi's, 1
arm, 1
in, 1
a, 1
group, 1
of, 1
peasants., 1
'Will, 1
you, 1
allow, 1
me,, 1
father?', 1
said, 1
Carmela.--'Certainly,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
'are, 1
we, 1
not, 1
in, 1
Carnival, 1
time?'--Carmela, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
talking, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
pointed, 1
with, 1
her, 1
finger, 1
to, 1
Teresa., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
looked,, 1
bowed, 1
in, 1
obedience,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Teresa,, 1
and, 1
invited, 1
her, 1
to, 1
dance, 1
in, 1
a, 1
quadrille, 1
directed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
daughter., 1
Teresa, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
flush, 1
pass, 1
over, 1
her, 1
face;, 1
she, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Luigi,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refuse, 1
his, 1
assent., 1
Luigi, 1
slowly, 1
relinquished, 1
Teresa's, 1
arm,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
held, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
Teresa,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
her, 1
elegant, 1
cavalier,, 1
took, 1
her, 1
appointed, 1
place, 1
with, 1
much, 1
agitation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
quadrille., 1
Certainly,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
an, 1
artist,, 1
the, 1
exact, 1
and, 1
strict, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
Teresa, 1
had, 1
a, 1
very, 1
different, 1
character, 1
from, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Carmela, 1
and, 1
her, 1
companions;, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
frivolous, 1
and, 1
coquettish,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
the, 1
embroidery, 1
and, 1
muslins,, 1
the, 1
cashmere, 1
waist-girdles,, 1
all, 1
dazzled, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
sapphires, 1
and, 1
diamonds, 1
almost, 1
turned, 1
her, 1
giddy, 1
brain., 1
"Luigi, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
sensation, 1
hitherto, 1
unknown, 1
arising, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
It, 1
was, 1
like, 1
an, 1
acute, 1
pain, 1
which, 1
gnawed, 1
at, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
thrilled, 1
through, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
body., 1
He, 1
followed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
each, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
Teresa, 1
and, 1
her, 1
cavalier;, 1
when, 1
their, 1
hands, 1
touched,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
should, 1
swoon;, 1
every, 1
pulse, 1
beat, 1
with, 1
violence,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
a, 1
bell, 1
were, 1
ringing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears., 1
When, 1
they, 1
spoke,, 1
although, 1
Teresa, 1
listened, 1
timidly, 1
and, 1
with, 1
downcast, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
of, 1
her, 1
cavalier,, 1
as, 1
Luigi, 1
could, 1
read, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ardent, 1
looks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
good-looking, 1
young, 1
man, 1
that, 1
his, 1
language, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
praise,, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
world, 1
was, 1
turning, 1
round, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
voices, 1
of, 1
hell, 1
were, 1
whispering, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears, 1
ideas, 1
of, 1
murder, 1
and, 1
assassination., 1
Then, 1
fearing, 1
that, 1
his, 1
paroxysm, 1
might, 1
get, 1
the, 1
better, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
clutched, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
branch, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tree, 1
against, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
leaning,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
convulsively, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
dagger, 1
with, 1
a, 1
carved, 1
handle, 1
which, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
belt,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
unwittingly,, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
the, 1
scabbard, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time., 1
Luigi, 1
was, 1
jealous!, 1
He, 1
felt, 1
that,, 1
influenced, 1
by, 1
her, 1
ambitions, 1
and, 1
coquettish, 1
disposition,, 1
Teresa, 1
might, 1
escape, 1
him., 1
"The, 1
young, 1
peasant, 1
girl,, 1
at, 1
first, 1
timid, 1
and, 1
scared,, 1
soon, 1
recovered, 1
herself., 1
We, 1
have, 1
said, 1
that, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
handsome,, 1
but, 1
this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
all;, 1
Teresa, 1
was, 1
endowed, 1
with, 1
all, 1
those, 1
wild, 1
graces, 1
which, 1
are, 1
so, 1
much, 1
more, 1
potent, 1
than, 1
our, 1
affected, 1
and, 1
studied, 1
elegancies., 1
She, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
all, 1
the, 1
honors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
quadrille,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
she, 1
were, 1
envious, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice's, 1
daughter,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
undertake, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
Carmela, 1
was, 1
not, 1
jealous, 1
of, 1
her., 1
And, 1
with, 1
overpowering, 1
compliments, 1
her, 1
handsome, 1
cavalier, 1
led, 1
her, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
place, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
where, 1
Luigi, 1
awaited, 1
her., 1
Twice, 1
or, 1
thrice, 1
during, 1
the, 1
dance, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
Luigi,, 1
and, 1
each, 1
time, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
that, 1
his, 1
features, 1
were, 1
agitated,, 1
once, 1
even, 1
the, 1
blade, 1
of, 1
his, 1
knife,, 1
half, 1
drawn, 1
from, 1
its, 1
sheath,, 1
had, 1
dazzled, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
its, 1
sinister, 1
glare., 1
Thus,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
tremblingly, 1
that, 1
she, 1
resumed, 1
her, 1
lover's, 1
arm., 1
The, 1
quadrille, 1
had, 1
been, 1
most, 1
perfect,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
demand, 1
for, 1
a, 1
repetition,, 1
Carmela, 1
alone, 1
objecting, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice, 1
besought, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
so, 1
earnestly,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
acceded., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cavaliers, 1
then, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
invite, 1
Teresa,, 1
without, 1
whom, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
the, 1
quadrille, 1
to, 1
be, 1
formed,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
truth, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
Luigi, 1
had, 1
not, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
to, 1
support, 1
another, 1
such, 1
trial,, 1
and,, 1
half, 1
by, 1
persuasion, 1
and, 1
half, 1
by, 1
force,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
removed, 1
Teresa, 1
toward, 1
another, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
Teresa, 1
had, 1
yielded, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
herself,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
she, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
agitated, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
she, 1
understood, 1
by, 1
his, 1
silence, 1
and, 1
trembling, 1
voice, 1
that, 1
something, 1
strange, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
within, 1
him., 1
She, 1
herself, 1
was, 1
not, 1
exempt, 1
from, 1
internal, 1
emotion,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
having, 1
done, 1
anything, 1
wrong,, 1
yet, 1
fully, 1
comprehended, 1
that, 1
Luigi, 1
was, 1
right, 1
in, 1
reproaching, 1
her., 1
Why,, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
but, 1
yet, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
the, 1
less, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
these, 1
reproaches, 1
were, 1
merited., 1
However,, 1
to, 1
Teresa's, 1
great, 1
astonishment,, 1
Luigi, 1
remained, 1
mute,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
a, 1
word, 1
escaped, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening., 1
When, 1
the, 1
chill, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night, 1
had, 1
driven, 1
away, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
from, 1
the, 1
gardens,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gates, 1
of, 1
the, 1
villa, 1
were, 1
closed, 1
on, 1
them, 1
for, 1
the, 1
festa, 1
in-doors,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
Teresa, 1
quite, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
left, 1
her, 1
at, 1
her, 1
home,, 1
he, 1
said,--, 1
"'Teresa,, 1
what, 1
were, 1
you, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
as, 1
you, 1
danced, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
young, 1
Countess, 1
of, 1
San-Felice?'--'I, 1
thought,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
frankness, 1
of, 1
her, 1
nature,, 1
'that, 1
I, 1
would, 1
give, 1
half, 1
my, 1
life, 1
for, 1
a, 1
costume, 1
such, 1
as, 1
she, 1
wore.', 1
"'And, 1
what, 1
said, 1
your, 1
cavalier, 1
to, 1
you?'--'He, 1
said, 1
it, 1
only, 1
depended, 1
on, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
have, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
only, 1
one, 1
word, 1
to, 1
say.', 1
"'He, 1
was, 1
right,', 1
said, 1
Luigi., 1
'Do, 1
you, 1
desire, 1
it, 1
as, 1
ardently, 1
as, 1
you, 1
say?'--'Yes.'--'Well,, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
it!', 1
"The, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
much, 1
astonished,, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head, 1
to, 1
look, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
face, 1
was, 1
so, 1
gloomy, 1
and, 1
terrible, 1
that, 1
her, 1
words, 1
froze, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
As, 1
Luigi, 1
spoke, 1
thus,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
her., 1
Teresa, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
into, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
she, 1
could,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
quite, 1
disappeared,, 1
she, 1
went, 1
into, 1
the, 1
house, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh., 1
"That, 1
night, 1
a, 1
memorable, 1
event, 1
occurred,, 1
due,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
imprudence, 1
of, 1
some, 1
servant, 1
who, 1
had, 1
neglected, 1
to, 1
extinguish, 1
the, 1
lights., 1
The, 1
Villa, 1
of, 1
San-Felice, 1
took, 1
fire, 1
in, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
adjoining, 1
the, 1
very, 1
apartment, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
Carmela., 1
Awakened, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
flames,, 1
she, 1
sprang, 1
out, 1
of, 1
bed,, 1
wrapped, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dressing-gown,, 1
and, 1
attempted, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
by, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
by, 1
which, 1
she, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
fly, 1
was, 1
already, 1
a, 1
prey, 1
to, 1
the, 1
flames., 1
She, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
calling, 1
for, 1
help, 1
as, 1
loudly, 1
as, 1
she, 1
could,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
her, 1
window,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
twenty, 1
feet, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
a, 1
young, 1
peasant, 1
jumped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
chamber,, 1
seized, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
superhuman, 1
skill, 1
and, 1
strength, 1
conveyed, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
turf, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grass-plot,, 1
where, 1
she, 1
fainted., 1
When, 1
she, 1
recovered,, 1
her, 1
father, 1
was, 1
by, 1
her, 1
side., 1
All, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
surrounded, 1
her,, 1
offering, 1
her, 1
assistance., 1
An, 1
entire, 1
wing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
villa, 1
was, 1
burnt, 1
down;, 1
but, 1
what, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
Carmela, 1
was, 1
safe, 1
and, 1
uninjured?, 1
Her, 1
preserver, 1
was, 1
everywhere, 1
sought, 1
for,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
inquired, 1
after,, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
him., 1
Carmela, 1
was, 1
greatly, 1
troubled, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
recognized, 1
him., 1
As, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
immensely, 1
rich,, 1
excepting, 1
the, 1
danger, 1
Carmela, 1
had, 1
run,--and, 1
the, 1
marvellous, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
escaped,, 1
made, 1
that, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
him, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
providence, 1
than, 1
a, 1
real, 1
misfortune,--the, 1
loss, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
conflagration, 1
was, 1
to, 1
him, 1
but, 1
a, 1
trifle., 1
"The, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
hour,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
peasants, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
borders, 1
of, 1
the, 1
forest., 1
Luigi, 1
arrived, 1
first., 1
He, 1
came, 1
toward, 1
Teresa, 1
in, 1
high, 1
spirits,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
completely, 1
forgotten, 1
the, 1
events, 1
of, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
was, 1
very, 1
pensive,, 1
but, 1
seeing, 1
Luigi, 1
so, 1
cheerful,, 1
she, 1
on, 1
her, 1
part, 1
assumed, 1
a, 1
smiling, 1
air,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
natural, 1
to, 1
her, 1
when, 1
she, 1
was, 1
not, 1
excited, 1
or, 1
in, 1
a, 1
passion., 1
Luigi, 1
took, 1
her, 1
arm, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
led, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
paused., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
perceiving, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
extraordinary,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
steadfastly., 1
'Teresa,', 1
said, 1
Luigi,, 1
'yesterday, 1
evening, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
you, 1
would, 1
give, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
costume, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
daughter.'--'Yes,', 1
replied, 1
Teresa, 1
with, 1
astonishment;, 1
'but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
mad, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
such, 1
a, 1
wish.'--'And, 1
I, 1
replied,, 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
it."'--'Yes,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
whose, 1
astonishment, 1
increased, 1
at, 1
every, 1
word, 1
uttered, 1
by, 1
Luigi,, 1
'but, 1
of, 1
course, 1
your, 1
reply, 1
was, 1
only, 1
to, 1
please, 1
me.', 1
"'I, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
no, 1
more, 1
than, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
you,, 1
Teresa,', 1
said, 1
Luigi, 1
proudly., 1
'Go, 1
into, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
and, 1
dress, 1
yourself.', 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
away, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
Teresa, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
by, 1
two, 1
wax, 1
lights,, 1
which, 1
burnt, 1
on, 1
each, 1
side, 1
of, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
mirror;, 1
on, 1
a, 1
rustic, 1
table,, 1
made, 1
by, 1
Luigi,, 1
were, 1
spread, 1
out, 1
the, 1
pearl, 1
necklace, 1
and, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
pins,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
at, 1
the, 1
side, 1
was, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
costume., 1
"Teresa, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy,, 1
and,, 1
without, 1
inquiring, 1
whence, 1
this, 1
attire, 1
came,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
thanking, 1
Luigi,, 1
darted, 1
into, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
transformed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
dressing-room., 1
Luigi, 1
pushed, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
behind, 1
her,, 1
for, 1
on, 1
the, 1
crest, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
adjacent, 1
hill, 1
which, 1
cut, 1
off, 1
the, 1
view, 1
toward, 1
Palestrina,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
stopping, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
uncertain, 1
of, 1
his, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
presenting, 1
against, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
sky, 1
that, 1
perfect, 1
outline, 1
which, 1
is, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
distant, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
southern, 1
climes., 1
When, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Luigi,, 1
he, 1
put, 1
his, 1
horse, 1
into, 1
a, 1
gallop, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
toward, 1
him., 1
Luigi, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken., 1
The, 1
traveller,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
going, 1
from, 1
Palestrina, 1
to, 1
Tivoli,, 1
had, 1
mistaken, 1
his, 1
way;, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
directed, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
at, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mile, 1
the, 1
road, 1
again, 1
divided, 1
into, 1
three, 1
ways,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
reaching, 1
these, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
might, 1
again, 1
stray, 1
from, 1
his, 1
route,, 1
he, 1
begged, 1
Luigi, 1
to, 1
be, 1
his, 1
guide., 1
Luigi, 1
threw, 1
his, 1
cloak, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
and, 1
freed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
heavy, 1
covering,, 1
preceded, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
step, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mountaineer,, 1
which, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
with., 1
In, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
Luigi, 1
and, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
cross-roads., 1
On, 1
arriving, 1
there,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
as, 1
majestic, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
an, 1
emperor,, 1
he, 1
stretched, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
that, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
roads, 1
which, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
was, 1
to, 1
follow.--"That, 1
is, 1
your, 1
road,, 1
excellency,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
you, 1
cannot, 1
again, 1
mistake."--'And, 1
here, 1
is, 1
your, 1
recompense,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
offering, 1
the, 1
young, 1
herdsman, 1
some, 1
small, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
money., 1
"'Thank, 1
you,', 1
said, 1
Luigi,, 1
drawing, 1
back, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
'I, 1
render, 1
a, 1
service,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
sell, 1
it.'--'Well,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
used, 1
to, 1
this, 1
difference, 1
between, 1
the, 1
servility, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cities, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mountaineer,, 1
'if, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
wages,, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
perhaps,, 1
accept, 1
a, 1
gift.'--'Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
another, 1
thing.'--'Then,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
'take, 1
these, 1
two, 1
Venetian, 1
sequins, 1
and, 1
give, 1
them, 1
to, 1
your, 1
bride,, 1
to, 1
make, 1
herself, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
earrings.', 1
"'And, 1
then, 1
do, 1
you, 1
take, 1
this, 1
poniard,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
herdsman;, 1
'you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
find, 1
one, 1

"'I, 1
accept, 1
it,', 1
answered, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
'but, 1
then, 1
the, 1
obligation, 1
will, 1
be, 1
on, 1
my, 1
side,, 1

for, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
engraved, 1
it, 1

"'What, 1
is, 1
your, 1
name?', 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
traveller.--'Luigi, 1
Vampa,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
shepherd,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
air, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
replied,, 1
Alexander,, 1
King, 1
of, 1
Macedon.--'And, 1
yours?'--'I,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
'am, 1
called, 1
Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.'", 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay, 1
started, 1
with, 1
surprise., 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
narrator;, 1
"that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
name, 1
which, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
gave, 1
to, 1
Vampa, 1
as, 1
his, 1

"Well,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
may, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
say, 1
against, 1
this, 1
name?", 1
inquired, 1
Albert;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
very, 1
pretty, 1
name,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
adventures, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
of, 1
that, 1
name, 1
amused, 1
me, 1
very, 1
much, 1
in, 1
my, 1
youth,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
confess."--Franz, 1
said, 1
no, 1
more., 1
The, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor,, 1
as, 1
may, 1
well, 1
be, 1
supposed,, 1
awakened, 1
in, 1
him, 1
a, 1
world, 1
of, 1
recollections,, 1
as, 1
had, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening., 1
"Proceed!", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
the, 1
host., 1
"Vampa, 1
put, 1
the, 1
two, 1
sequins, 1
haughtily, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
slowly, 1
returned, 1
by, 1
the, 1
way, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone., 1
As, 1
he, 1
came, 1
within, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
paces, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
cry., 1
He, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
know, 1
whence, 1
this, 1
sound, 1
could, 1
proceed., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
own, 1
name, 1
pronounced, 1
distinctly., 1
The, 1
cry, 1
proceeded, 1
from, 1
the, 1
grotto., 1
He, 1
bounded, 1
like, 1
a, 1
chamois,, 1
cocking, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
as, 1
he, 1
went,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
a, 1
hill, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
that, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
perceived, 1
the, 1
traveller., 1
Three, 1
cries, 1
for, 1
help, 1
came, 1
more, 1
distinctly, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ear., 1
He, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
around, 1
him, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
man, 1
carrying, 1
off, 1
Teresa,, 1
as, 1
Nessus,, 1
the, 1
centaur,, 1
carried, 1
Dejanira., 1
This, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
hastening, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
wood,, 1
was, 1
already, 1
three-quarters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
way, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
from, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
to, 1
the, 1
forest., 1
Vampa, 1
measured, 1
the, 1
distance;, 1
the, 1
man, 1
was, 1
at, 1
least, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
paces, 1
in, 1
advance, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
overtaking, 1
him., 1
The, 1
young, 1
shepherd, 1
stopped,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
had, 1
been, 1
rooted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
put, 1
the, 1
butt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
to, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
took, 1
aim, 1
at, 1
the, 1
ravisher,, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
second, 1
in, 1
his, 1
track,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
fired., 1
The, 1
ravisher, 1
stopped, 1
suddenly,, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
bent, 1
under, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
with, 1
Teresa, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
rose, 1
instantly,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
man, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
struggling, 1
in, 1
the, 1
agonies, 1
of, 1
death., 1
Vampa, 1
then, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
Teresa;, 1
for, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man, 1
her, 1
legs, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
had, 1
dropped, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
that, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
down, 1
his, 1
enemy,, 1
had, 1
also, 1
wounded, 1
his, 1
betrothed., 1
Fortunately,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
unscathed,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fright, 1
alone, 1
that, 1
had, 1
overcome, 1
Teresa., 1
When, 1
Luigi, 1
had, 1
assured, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
safe, 1
and, 1
unharmed,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
wounded, 1
man., 1
He, 1
had, 1
just, 1
expired,, 1
with, 1
clinched, 1
hands,, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
in, 1
a, 1
spasm, 1
of, 1
agony,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
on, 1
end, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sweat, 1
of, 1
death., 1
His, 1
eyes, 1
remained, 1
open, 1
and, 1
menacing., 1
Vampa, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
and, 1
recognized, 1
Cucumetto., 1
From, 1
the, 1
day, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
had, 1
been, 1
saved, 1
by, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
peasants,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
enamoured, 1
of, 1
Teresa,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
sworn, 1
she, 1
should, 1
be, 1
his., 1
From, 1
that, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
profiting, 1
by, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
had, 1
left, 1
her, 1
alone,, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
her, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
believed, 1
he, 1
at, 1
length, 1
had, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
power,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
ball,, 1
directed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
unerring, 1
skill, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
herdsman,, 1
had, 1
pierced, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
Vampa, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
without, 1
betraying, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
emotion;, 1
while,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
Teresa,, 1
shuddering, 1
in, 1
every, 1
limb,, 1
dared, 1
not, 1
approach, 1
the, 1
slain, 1
ruffian, 1
but, 1
by, 1
degrees,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
hesitating, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
body, 1
over, 1
the, 1
shoulder, 1
of, 1
her, 1
lover., 1
Suddenly, 1
Vampa, 1
turned, 1
toward, 1
his, 1
mistress:--'Ah,', 1
said, 1
he--'good,, 1
good!, 1
You, 1
are, 1
dressed;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
now, 1
my, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
dress, 1
myself.', 1
"Teresa, 1
was, 1
clothed, 1
from, 1
head, 1
to, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
San-Felice's, 1
daughter., 1
Vampa, 1
took, 1
Cucumetto's, 1
body, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
grotto,, 1
while, 1
in, 1
her, 1
turn, 1
Teresa, 1
remained, 1
outside., 1
If, 1
a, 1
second, 1
traveller, 1
had, 1
passed,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
thing,--a, 1
shepherdess, 1
watching, 1
her, 1
flock,, 1
clad, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cashmere, 1
grown,, 1
with, 1
ear-rings, 1
and, 1
necklace, 1
of, 1
pearls,, 1
diamond, 1
pins,, 1
and, 1
buttons, 1
of, 1
sapphires,, 1
emeralds,, 1
and, 1
rubies., 1
He, 1
would,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
have, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
times, 1
of, 1
Florian,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
have, 1
declared,, 1
on, 1
reaching, 1
Paris,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
met, 1
an, 1
Alpine, 1
shepherdess, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Sabine, 1
Hill., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
Vampa, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
grotto;, 1
his, 1
costume, 1
was, 1
no, 1
less, 1
elegant, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Teresa., 1
He, 1
wore, 1
a, 1
vest, 1
of, 1
garnet-colored, 1
velvet,, 1
with, 1
buttons, 1
of, 1
cut, 1
gold;, 1
a, 1
silk, 1
waistcoat, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
embroidery;, 1
a, 1
Roman, 1
scarf, 1
tied, 1
round, 1
his, 1
neck;, 1
a, 1
cartridge-box, 1
worked, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
and, 1
red, 1
and, 1
green, 1
silk;, 1
sky-blue, 1
velvet, 1
breeches,, 1
fastened, 1
above, 1
the, 1
knee, 1
with, 1
diamond, 1
buckles;, 1
garters, 1
of, 1
deerskin,, 1
worked, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
arabesques,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hat, 1
whereon, 1
hung, 1
ribbons, 1
of, 1
all, 1
colors;, 1
two, 1
watches, 1
hung, 1
from, 1
his, 1
girdle,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
poniard, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
belt., 1
Teresa, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
admiration., 1
Vampa, 1
in, 1
this, 1
attire, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
painting, 1
by, 1
Leopold, 1
Robert,, 1
or, 1
Schnetz., 1
He, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
Cucumetto., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
produced, 1
on, 1
his, 1
betrothed,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
pride, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
lips.--'Now,', 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Teresa,, 1
'are, 1
you, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
share, 1
my, 1
fortune,, 1
whatever, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be?'--'Oh,, 1
yes!', 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
enthusiastically.--'And, 1
follow, 1
me, 1
wherever, 1
I, 1
go?'--'To, 1
the, 1
world's, 1
end.'--'Then, 1
take, 1
my, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
on;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose.'--The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
did, 1
so, 1
without, 1
questioning, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
as, 1
to, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
conducting, 1
her,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
her, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
as, 1
handsome,, 1
proud,, 1
and, 1
powerful, 1
as, 1
a, 1
god., 1
They, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
entered, 1
it., 1
We, 1
need, 1
scarcely, 1
say, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
paths, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mountain, 1
were, 1
known, 1
to, 1
Vampa;, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
went, 1
forward, 1
without, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
hesitation,, 1
although, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
beaten, 1
track,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
his, 1
path, 1
by, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
trees, 1
and, 1
bushes,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
they, 1
kept, 1
on, 1
advancing, 1
for, 1
nearly, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
this, 1
time, 1
they, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
thickest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
forest., 1
A, 1
torrent,, 1
whose, 1
bed, 1
was, 1
dry,, 1
led, 1
into, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
gorge., 1
Vampa, 1
took, 1
this, 1
wild, 1
road,, 1
which,, 1
enclosed, 1
between, 1
two, 1
ridges,, 1
and, 1
shadowed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
tufted, 1
umbrage, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pines,, 1
seemed,, 1
but, 1
for, 1
the, 1
difficulties, 1
of, 1
its, 1
descent,, 1
that, 1
path, 1
to, 1
Avernus, 1
of, 1
which, 1
Virgil, 1
speaks., 1
Teresa, 1
had, 1
become, 1
alarmed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
and, 1
deserted, 1
look, 1
of, 1
the, 1
plain, 1
around, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
closely, 1
against, 1
her, 1
guide,, 1
not, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
syllable;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
advance, 1
with, 1
even, 1
step, 1
and, 1
composed, 1
countenance,, 1
she, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
repress, 1
her, 1
emotion., 1
Suddenly,, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
them,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
advanced, 1
from, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
tree, 1
and, 1
aimed, 1
at, 1
Vampa.--'Not, 1
another, 1
step,', 1
he, 1
said,, 1
'or, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
man.'--'What,, 1
then,', 1
said, 1
Vampa,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
disdain,, 1
while, 1
Teresa,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
able, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
her, 1
alarm,, 1
clung, 1
closely, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
'do, 1
wolves, 1
rend, 1
each, 1
other?'--'Who, 1
are, 1
you?', 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
sentinel.--'I, 1
am, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa,, 1
shepherd, 1
of, 1
the, 1
San-Felice, 1
farm.'--'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?'--'I, 1
would, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
your, 1
companions, 1
who, 1
are, 1
in, 1
the, 1
glade, 1
at, 1
Rocca, 1
Bianca.'--'Follow, 1
me,, 1
then,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
sentinel;, 1
'or,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
know, 1
your, 1
way,, 1
go, 1
first.'--Vampa, 1
smiled, 1
disdainfully, 1
at, 1
this, 1
precaution, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandit,, 1
went, 1
before, 1
Teresa,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
advance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
easy, 1
step, 1
as, 1
before., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
made, 1
them, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
stop., 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
persons, 1
obeyed., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
thrice, 1
imitated, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
a, 1
crow;, 1
a, 1
croak, 1
answered, 1
this, 1
signal.--'Good!', 1
said, 1
the, 1
sentry,, 1
'you, 1
may, 1
now, 1
go, 1
on.'--Luigi, 1
and, 1
Teresa, 1
again, 1
set, 1
forward;, 1
as, 1
they, 1
went, 1
on, 1
Teresa, 1
clung, 1
tremblingly, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
weapons, 1
and, 1
the, 1
glistening, 1
of, 1
carbines, 1
through, 1
the, 1
trees., 1
The, 1
retreat, 1
of, 1
Rocca, 1
Bianca, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
mountain,, 1
which, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
in, 1
former, 1
days, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
volcano--an, 1
extinct, 1
volcano, 1
before, 1
the, 1
days, 1
when, 1
Remus, 1
and, 1
Romulus, 1
had, 1
deserted, 1
Alba, 1
to, 1
come, 1
and, 1
found, 1
the, 1
city, 1
of, 1
Rome., 1
Teresa, 1
and, 1
Luigi, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
summit,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
at, 1
once, 1
found, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
twenty, 1
bandits., 1
'Here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
seeks, 1
and, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
sentinel.--'What, 1
has, 1
he, 1
to, 1
say?', 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
command, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chief's, 1
absence.--'I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
a, 1
shepherd's, 1
life,', 1
was, 1
Vampa's, 1
reply.--'Ah,, 1
I, 1
understand,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
lieutenant;, 1
'and, 1
you, 1
seek, 1
admittance, 1
into, 1
our, 1
ranks?'--'Welcome!', 1
cried, 1
several, 1
bandits, 1
from, 1
Ferrusino,, 1
Pampinara,, 1
and, 1
Anagni,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa.--'Yes,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
something, 1
more, 1
than, 1
to, 1
be, 1
your, 1
companion.'--'And, 1
what, 1
may, 1
that, 1
be?', 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
with, 1
astonishment.--'I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
to, 1
be, 1
your, 1
captain,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
bandits, 1
shouted, 1
with, 1
laughter., 1
'And, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
done, 1
to, 1
aspire, 1
to, 1
this, 1
honor?', 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
lieutenant.--'I, 1
have, 1
killed, 1
your, 1
chief,, 1
Cucumetto,, 1
whose, 1
dress, 1
I, 1
now, 1
wear;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
set, 1
fire, 1
to, 1
the, 1
villa, 1
San-Felice, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
a, 1
wedding-dress, 1
for, 1
my, 1
betrothed.', 1
An, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
was, 1
chosen, 1
captain,, 1
vice, 1
Cucumetto, 1
deceased.", 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
friend;, 1
"what, 1
think, 1
you, 1
of, 1
citizen, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa?", 1
"I, 1
say, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
myth,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"and, 1
never, 1
had, 1
an, 1
existence.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
may, 1
a, 1
myth, 1
be?", 1
inquired, 1
Pastrini., 1
"The, 1
explanation, 1
would, 1
be, 1
too, 1
long,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
landlord,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
say, 1
that, 1
Signor, 1
Vampa, 1
exercises, 1
his, 1
profession, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
environs, 1
of, 1
Rome?", 1
"And, 1
with, 1
a, 1
boldness, 1
of, 1
which, 1
no, 1
bandit, 1
before, 1
him, 1
ever, 1
gave, 1
an, 1
example.", 1
"Then, 1
the, 1
police, 1
have, 1
vainly, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
lay, 1
hands, 1
on, 1
him?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
good, 1
understanding, 1
with, 1
the, 1
shepherds, 1
in, 1
the, 1
plains,, 1
the, 1
fishermen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Tiber,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
smugglers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coast., 1
They, 1
seek, 1
for, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mountains,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
on, 1
the, 1
waters;, 1
they, 1
follow, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
waters,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
on, 1
the, 1
open, 1
sea;, 1
then, 1
they, 1
pursue, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
has, 1
suddenly, 1
taken, 1
refuge, 1
in, 1
the, 1
islands,, 1
at, 1
Giglio,, 1
Guanouti,, 1
or, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
they, 1
hunt, 1
for, 1
him, 1
there,, 1
he, 1
reappears, 1
suddenly, 1
at, 1
Albano,, 1
Tivoli,, 1
or, 1
La, 1
Riccia.", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
does, 1
he, 1
behave, 1
towards, 1
travellers?", 1
"Alas!, 1
his, 1
plan, 1
is, 1
very, 1
simple., 1
It, 1
depends, 1
on, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
he, 1
may, 1
be, 1
from, 1
the, 1
city,, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
gives, 1
eight, 1
hours,, 1
twelve, 1
hours,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
day, 1
wherein, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
their, 1
ransom;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
that, 1
time, 1
has, 1
elapsed, 1
he, 1
allows, 1
another, 1
hour's, 1
grace., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sixtieth, 1
minute, 1
of, 1
this, 1
hour,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
money, 1
is, 1
not, 1
forthcoming,, 1
he, 1
blows, 1
out, 1
the, 1
prisoner's, 1
brains, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pistol-shot,, 1
or, 1
plants, 1
his, 1
dagger, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
settles, 1
the, 1
account.", 1
"Well,, 1
Albert,", 1
inquired, 1
Franz, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
still, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
by, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
wall?", 1
"Quite, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"if, 1
the, 1
way, 1
be, 1
picturesque.", 1
The, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
nine, 1
as, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
coachman, 1
appeared., 1
"Excellencies,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"the, 1
coach, 1
is, 1
ready.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum.", 1
"By, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
del, 1
Popolo, 1
or, 1
by, 1
the, 1
streets,, 1
your, 1
excellencies?", 1
"By, 1
the, 1
streets,, 1
morbleu,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
streets!", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
rising,, 1
and, 1
lighting, 1
his, 1
third, 1
cigar,, 1
"really,, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
had, 1
more, 1
courage.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
went, 1
down, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
got, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Chapter, 1
34., 1
The, 1
Colosseum., 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
so, 1
managed, 1
his, 1
route,, 1
that, 1
during, 1
the, 1
ride, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
not, 1
a, 1
single, 1
ancient, 1
ruin,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
no, 1
preliminary, 1
impression, 1
interfered, 1
to, 1
mitigate, 1
the, 1
colossal, 1
proportions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gigantic, 1
building, 1
they, 1
came, 1
to, 1
admire., 1
The, 1
road, 1
selected, 1
was, 1
a, 1
continuation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Sistina;, 1
then, 1
by, 1
cutting, 1
off, 1
the, 1
right, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street, 1
in, 1
which, 1
stands, 1
Santa, 1
Maria, 1
Maggiore, 1
and, 1
proceeding, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Urbana, 1
and, 1
San, 1
Pietro, 1
in, 1
Vincoli,, 1
the, 1
travellers, 1
would, 1
find, 1
themselves, 1
directly, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
Colosseum., 1
This, 1
itinerary, 1
possessed, 1
another, 1
great, 1
advantage,--that, 1
of, 1
leaving, 1
Franz, 1
at, 1
full, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
indulge, 1
his, 1
deep, 1
reverie, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini's, 1
story,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
his, 1
mysterious, 1
host, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
so, 1
strangely, 1
mixed, 1
up., 1
Seated, 1
with, 1
folded, 1
arms, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
he, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
ponder, 1
over, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
history, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
lately, 1
listened, 1
to,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
himself, 1
an, 1
interminable, 1
number, 1
of, 1
questions, 1
touching, 1
its, 1
various, 1
circumstances, 1
without,, 1
however,, 1
arriving, 1
at, 1
a, 1
satisfactory, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
any, 1
of, 1
them., 1
One, 1
fact, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
brought, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor", 1
back, 1
to, 1
his, 1
recollection,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
intimacy, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
exist, 1
between, 1
the, 1
brigands, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sailors;, 1
and, 1
Pastrini's, 1
account, 1
of, 1
Vampa's, 1
having, 1
found, 1
refuge, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
vessels, 1
of, 1
smugglers, 1
and, 1
fishermen,, 1
reminded, 1
Franz, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
supping, 1
so, 1
amicably, 1
with, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
yacht,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
even, 1
deviated, 1
from, 1
its, 1
course, 1
and, 1
touched, 1
at, 1
Porto-Vecchio, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sole, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
landing, 1
them., 1
The, 1
very, 1
name, 1
assumed, 1
by, 1
his, 1
host, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
again, 1
repeated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
landlord, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres,, 1
abundantly, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
his, 1
island, 1
friend, 1
was, 1
playing, 1
his, 1
philanthropic, 1
part, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shores, 1
of, 1
Piombino,, 1
Civita-Vecchio,, 1
Ostia,, 1
and, 1
Gaeta,, 1
as, 1
on, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Corsica,, 1
Tuscany,, 1
and, 1
Spain;, 1
and, 1
further,, 1
Franz, 1
bethought, 1
him, 1
of, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
singular, 1
entertainer, 1
speak, 1
both, 1
of, 1
Tunis, 1
and, 1
Palermo,, 1
proving, 1
thereby, 1
how, 1
largely, 1
his, 1
circle, 1
of, 1
acquaintances, 1
extended., 1
But, 1
however, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
might, 1
be, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
these, 1
reflections,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
once, 1
dispersed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
frowning, 1
ruins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stupendous, 1
Colosseum,, 1
through, 1
the, 1
various, 1
openings, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
moonlight, 1
played, 1
and, 1
flickered, 1
like, 1
the, 1
unearthly, 1
gleam, 1
from, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wandering, 1
dead., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
near, 1
the, 1
Meta, 1
Sudans;, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
eagerly, 1
alighting,, 1
found, 1
themselves, 1
opposite, 1
a, 1
cicerone,, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
sprung, 1
up, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
so, 1
unexpected, 1
was, 1
his, 1
appearance., 1
The, 1
usual, 1
guide, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
having, 1
followed, 1
them,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
paid, 1
two, 1
conductors,, 1
nor, 1
is, 1
it, 1
possible,, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
this, 1
abundant, 1
supply, 1
of, 1
guides;, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
ordinary, 1
cicerone,, 1
who, 1
seizes, 1
upon, 1
you, 1
directly, 1
you, 1
set, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hotel,, 1
and, 1
never, 1
quits, 1
you, 1
while, 1
you, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
city,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
also, 1
a, 1
special, 1
cicerone, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
each, 1
monument--nay,, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
each, 1
part, 1
of, 1
a, 1
monument., 1
It, 1
may,, 1
therefore,, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
imagined, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
scarcity, 1
of, 1
guides, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
that, 1
wonder, 1
of, 1
all, 1
ages,, 1
which, 1
Martial, 1
thus, 1
eulogizes:, 1
"Let, 1
Memphis, 1
cease, 1
to, 1
boast, 1
the, 1
barbarous, 1
miracles, 1
of, 1
her, 1
pyramids,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
wonders, 1
of, 1
Babylon, 1
be, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
no, 1
more, 1
among, 1
us;, 1
all, 1
must, 1
bow, 1
to, 1
the, 1
superiority, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gigantic, 1
labor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Caesars,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
many, 1
voices, 1
of, 1
Fame, 1
spread, 1
far, 1
and, 1
wide, 1
the, 1
surpassing, 1
merits, 1
of, 1
this, 1
incomparable, 1
monument.", 1
As, 1
for, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
Franz,, 1
they, 1
essayed, 1
not, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
from, 1
their, 1
ciceronian, 1
tyrants;, 1
and,, 1
indeed,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
more, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
break, 1
their, 1
bondage,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
guides, 1
alone, 1
are, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
these, 1
monuments, 1
with, 1
torches, 1
in, 1
their, 1
hands., 1
Thus,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men, 1
made, 1
no, 1
attempt, 1
at, 1
resistance,, 1
but, 1
blindly, 1
and, 1
confidingly, 1
surrendered, 1
themselves, 1
into, 1
the, 1
care, 1
and, 1
custody, 1
of, 1
their, 1
conductors., 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
already, 1
made, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
similar, 1
excursions, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
less, 1
favored, 1
companion, 1
trod, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
in, 1
his, 1
life, 1
the, 1
classic, 1
ground, 1
forming, 1
the, 1
monument, 1
of, 1
Flavius, 1
Vespasian;, 1
and,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
credit, 1
be, 1
it, 1
spoken,, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
even, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
glib, 1
loquacity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guides,, 1
was, 1
duly, 1
and, 1
deeply, 1
touched, 1
with, 1
awe, 1
and, 1
enthusiastic, 1
admiration, 1
of, 1
all, 1
he, 1
saw;, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
no, 1
adequate, 1
notion, 1
of, 1
these, 1
stupendous, 1
ruins, 1
can, 1
be, 1
formed, 1
save, 1
by, 1
such, 1
as, 1
have, 1
visited, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
by, 1
moonlight,, 1
at, 1
which, 1
time, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
proportions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
building, 1
appear, 1
twice, 1
as, 1
large, 1
when, 1
viewed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
beams, 1
of, 1
a, 1
southern, 1
moonlit, 1
sky,, 1
whose, 1
rays, 1
are, 1
sufficiently, 1
clear, 1
and, 1
vivid, 1
to, 1
light, 1
the, 1
horizon, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glow, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
the, 1
soft, 1
twilight, 1
of, 1
an, 1
eastern, 1
clime., 1
Scarcely,, 1
therefore,, 1
had, 1
the, 1
reflective, 1
Franz, 1
walked, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
steps, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
interior, 1
porticoes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ruin,, 1
than,, 1
abandoning, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
the, 1
guides, 1
(who, 1
would, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
yield, 1
their, 1
prescriptive, 1
right, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
their, 1
victims, 1
through, 1
the, 1
routine, 1
regularly, 1
laid, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
regularly, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
them,, 1
but, 1
dragged, 1
the, 1
unconscious, 1
visitor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
various, 1
objects, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pertinacity, 1
that, 1
admitted, 1
of, 1
no, 1
appeal,, 1
beginning,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Lions', 1
Den,, 1
and, 1
finishing, 1
with, 1
Caesar's, 1
"Podium,"),, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
a, 1
jargon, 1
and, 1
mechanical, 1
survey, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wonders, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
surrounded,, 1
Franz, 1
ascended, 1
a, 1
half-dilapidated, 1
staircase,, 1
and,, 1
leaving, 1
them, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
their, 1
monotonous, 1
round,, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
column,, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
opposite, 1
a, 1
large, 1
aperture,, 1
which, 1
permitted, 1
him, 1
to, 1
enjoy, 1
a, 1
full, 1
and, 1
undisturbed, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gigantic, 1
dimensions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
majestic, 1
ruin., 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
for, 1
nearly, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
perfectly, 1
hidden, 1
by, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
column, 1
at, 1
whose, 1
base, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
a, 1
resting-place,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
motions, 1
of, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
his, 1
guides,, 1
who,, 1
holding, 1
torches, 1
in, 1
their, 1
hands,, 1
had, 1
emerged, 1
from, 1
a, 1
vomitarium, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
extremity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
again, 1
disappeared, 1
down, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
conducting, 1
to, 1
the, 1
seats, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Vestal, 1
virgins,, 1
resembling,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
glided, 1
along,, 1
some, 1
restless, 1
shades, 1
following, 1
the, 1
flickering, 1
glare, 1
of, 1
so, 1
many, 1
ignes-fatui., 1
All, 1
at, 1
once, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
caught, 1
a, 1
sound, 1
resembling, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
rolling, 1
down, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
one, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
ascended., 1
There, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
remarkable, 1
in, 1
the, 1
circumstance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fragment, 1
of, 1
granite, 1
giving, 1
way, 1
and, 1
falling, 1
heavily, 1
below;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
substance, 1
that, 1
fell, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
pressure, 1
of, 1
a, 1
foot,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
that, 1
some, 1
one,, 1
who, 1
endeavored, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
his, 1
footsteps, 1
from, 1
being, 1
heard,, 1
was, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
sat., 1
Conjecture, 1
soon, 1
became, 1
certainty,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
figure, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
was, 1
distinctly, 1
visible, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
gradually, 1
emerging, 1
from, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
opposite,, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
was, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
pouring, 1
a, 1
full, 1
tide, 1
of, 1
silvery, 1
brightness., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
thus, 1
presenting, 1
himself, 1
was, 1
probably, 1
a, 1
person, 1
who,, 1
like, 1
Franz,, 1
preferred, 1
the, 1
enjoyment, 1
of, 1
solitude, 1
and, 1
his, 1
own, 1
thoughts, 1
to, 1
the, 1
frivolous, 1
gabble, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guides., 1
And, 1
his, 1
appearance, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
extraordinary, 1
in, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
hesitation, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
proceeded,, 1
stopping, 1
and, 1
listening, 1
with, 1
anxious, 1
attention, 1
at, 1
every, 1
step, 1
he, 1
took,, 1
convinced, 1
Franz, 1
that, 1
he, 1
expected, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
some, 1
person., 1
By, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
instinctive, 1
impulse,, 1
Franz, 1
withdrew, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
behind, 1
his, 1
pillar., 1
About, 1
ten, 1
feet, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
and, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
were,, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
had, 1
given, 1
way,, 1
leaving, 1
a, 1
large, 1
round, 1
opening,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
vault, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
thickly, 1
studded, 1
with, 1
stars., 1
Around, 1
this, 1
opening,, 1
which, 1
had,, 1
possibly,, 1
for, 1
ages, 1
permitted, 1
a, 1
free, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
brilliant, 1
moonbeams, 1
that, 1
now, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
pile,, 1
grew, 1
a, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
creeping, 1
plants,, 1
whose, 1
delicate, 1
green, 1
branches, 1
stood, 1
out, 1
in, 1
bold, 1
relief, 1
against, 1
the, 1
clear, 1
azure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
firmament,, 1
while, 1
large, 1
masses, 1
of, 1
thick,, 1
strong, 1
fibrous, 1
shoots, 1
forced, 1
their, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
chasm,, 1
and, 1
hung, 1
floating, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro,, 1
like, 1
so, 1
many, 1
waving, 1
strings., 1
The, 1
person, 1
whose, 1
mysterious, 1
arrival, 1
had, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
half-light,, 1
that, 1
rendered, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
although, 1
his, 1
dress, 1
was, 1
easily, 1
made, 1
out., 1
He, 1
wore, 1
a, 1
large, 1
brown, 1
mantle,, 1
one, 1
fold, 1
of, 1
which,, 1
thrown, 1
over, 1
his, 1
left, 1
shoulder,, 1
served, 1
likewise, 1
to, 1
mask, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
part, 1
was, 1
completely, 1
hidden, 1
by, 1
his, 1
broad-brimmed, 1
hat., 1
The, 1
lower, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dress, 1
was, 1
more, 1
distinctly, 1
visible, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bright, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moon,, 1
which,, 1
entering, 1
through, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
ceiling,, 1
shed, 1
their, 1
refulgent, 1
beams, 1
on, 1
feet, 1
cased, 1
in, 1
elegantly, 1
made, 1
boots, 1
of, 1
polished, 1
leather,, 1
over, 1
which, 1
descended, 1
fashionably, 1
cut, 1
trousers, 1
of, 1
black, 1
cloth., 1
From, 1
the, 1
imperfect, 1
means, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
of, 1
judging,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
only, 1
come, 1
to, 1
one, 1
conclusion,--that, 1
the, 1
person, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
watching, 1
certainly, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
no, 1
inferior, 1
station, 1
of, 1
life., 1
Some, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
had, 1
elapsed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
began, 1
to, 1
show, 1
manifest, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
impatience,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
noise, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
aperture, 1
in, 1
the, 1
roof,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
shadow, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
obstruct, 1
the, 1
flood, 1
of, 1
light, 1
that, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
figure, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
was, 1
clearly, 1
seen, 1
gazing, 1
with, 1
eager, 1
scrutiny, 1
on, 1
the, 1
immense, 1
space, 1
beneath, 1
him;, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
caught, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle,, 1
he, 1
grasped, 1
a, 1
floating, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
thickly, 1
matted, 1
boughs,, 1
and, 1
glided, 1
down, 1
by, 1
their, 1
help, 1
to, 1
within, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
leaped, 1
lightly, 1
on, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
The, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
performed, 1
this, 1
daring, 1
act, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
indifference, 1
wore, 1
the, 1
Transtevere, 1
costume., 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
excellency's, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
keeping, 1
you, 1
waiting,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
dialect,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
think, 1
I'm, 1
many, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
my, 1
time,, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1

just, 1
struck, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Lateran.", 1
"Say, 1
not, 1
a, 1
word, 1
about, 1
being, 1
late,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
in, 1
purest, 1
Tuscan;, 1
"'tis, 1
I, 1
who, 1
am, 1
too, 1
soon., 1
But, 1
even, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
me, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
little, 1
while,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
felt, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
the, 1
delay, 1

not, 1
occasioned, 1

any, 1
fault, 1
of, 1
yours.", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
perfectly, 1
right, 1
in, 1
so, 1
thinking,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man;, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
here, 1
direct, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Castle, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Angelo,, 1

I, 1
had, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
trouble, 1
before, 1
I, 1
could, 1
get, 1
a, 1
chance, 1
to, 1

Beppo.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
is, 1
Beppo?", 1
"Oh,, 1
Beppo, 1
is, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1

give, 1
him, 1
so, 1
much, 1
a, 1

me, 1
know, 1

"Indeed!, 1

"Why,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
knows, 1
what, 1
may, 1
happen., 1
Perhaps, 1
some, 1
of, 1
these, 1
days, 1

may, 1
be, 1
entrapped,, 1

poor, 1
Peppino, 1

little, 1
nibbling, 1

to, 1
gnaw, 1
the, 1

of, 1
my, 1

me, 1
out, 1

"Briefly,, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
glean?", 1
"That, 1

outward, 1
flight, 1

made, 1

summons, 1

from, 1
springing, 1
on, 1

let, 1
him, 1
proceed, 1
without, 1
interruption,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
what, 1
was, 1
said;, 1

longed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
free, 1
to, 1
ponder, 1
over, 1
all, 1
that, 1
had, 1

whose, 1
mysterious, 1
meeting, 1
in, 1

had, 1
so, 1
unintentionally, 1
witnessed,, 1
was, 1
an, 1
entire, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
him,, 1

not, 1
so, 1
the, 1
other;, 1
and, 1
though, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
from, 1

wrapped, 1
in, 1

obscured, 1
by, 1
the, 1
shadow,, 1
the, 1
tones, 1
of, 1

had, 1
made, 1
too, 1

an, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
him, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
them, 1
for, 1
him, 1
ever, 1
again, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
them,, 1
hear, 1
them, 1
when, 1
or, 1
where, 1
he, 1
might., 1
It, 1
was, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
this, 1
man, 1
was, 1
speaking, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
half, 1
jesting,, 1
half, 1
bitter,, 1
that, 1
Franz's, 1
ear, 1
recalled, 1
most, 1
vividly, 1
the, 1
deep, 1
sonorous,, 1
yet, 1
well-pitched, 1
voice, 1
that, 1
had, 1
addressed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
for, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
and, 1
ruined, 1
grandeur, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colosseum., 1
And, 1
the, 1
more, 1
he, 1
thought,, 1
the, 1
more, 1
entire, 1
was, 1
his, 1
conviction,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
wore, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
was, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
his, 1
former, 1
host, 1
and, 1
entertainer,, 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.", 1
Under, 1
any, 1
other, 1
circumstances,, 1
Franz, 1
would, 1
have, 1
found, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
his, 1
extreme, 1
curiosity, 1
to, 1
know, 1
more, 1
of, 1
so, 1
singular, 1
a, 1
personage,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
that, 1
intent, 1
have, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
their, 1
short, 1
acquaintance;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
present, 1
instance,, 1
the, 1
confidential, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
he, 1
had, 1
overheard, 1
made, 1
him,, 1
with, 1
propriety,, 1
judge, 1
that, 1
his, 1
appearance, 1
at, 1
such, 1
a, 1
time, 1
would, 1
be, 1
anything, 1
but, 1
agreeable., 1
As, 1
we, 1
have, 1
seen,, 1
therefore,, 1
he, 1
permitted, 1
his, 1
former, 1
host, 1
to, 1
retire, 1
without, 1
attempting, 1
a, 1
recognition,, 1
but, 1
fully, 1
promising, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
indemnity, 1
for, 1
his, 1
present, 1
forbearance, 1
should, 1
chance, 1
afford, 1
him, 1
another, 1
opportunity., 1
In, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
Franz, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
many, 1
perplexing, 1
thoughts, 1
which, 1
assailed, 1
him;, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
he, 1
court, 1
the, 1
refreshment, 1
of, 1
sleep., 1
Slumber, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
his, 1
eyelids, 1
and, 1
the, 1
night, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
feverish, 1
contemplation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chain, 1
of, 1
circumstances, 1
tending, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
the, 1
identity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
visitant, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
with, 1
the, 1
inhabitant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
more, 1
he, 1
thought,, 1
the, 1
firmer, 1
grew, 1
his, 1
opinion, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
Worn, 1
out, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
asleep, 1
at, 1
daybreak,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
awake, 1
till, 1
late., 1
Like, 1
a, 1
genuine, 1
Frenchman,, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
employed, 1
his, 1
time, 1
in, 1
arranging, 1
for, 1
the, 1
evening's, 1
diversion;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
engage, 1
a, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Teatro, 1
Argentino;, 1
and, 1
Franz,, 1
having, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
letters, 1
to, 1
write,, 1
relinquished, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
Albert, 1
for, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day., 1
At, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
Albert, 1
returned,, 1
delighted, 1
with, 1
his, 1
day's, 1
work;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
leaving, 1
his, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
introduction,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
received, 1
in, 1
return, 1
more, 1
invitations, 1
to, 1
balls, 1
and, 1
routs, 1
than, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
possible, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
accept;, 1
besides, 1
this,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
(as, 1
he, 1
called, 1
it), 1
all, 1
the, 1
remarkable, 1
sights, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
Yes,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
single, 1
day, 1
he, 1
had, 1
accomplished, 1
what, 1
his, 1
more, 1
serious-minded, 1
companion, 1
would, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
weeks, 1
to, 1
effect., 1
Neither, 1
had, 1
he, 1
neglected, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
piece, 1
to, 1
be, 1
played, 1
that, 1
night, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Teatro, 1
Argentino,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
what, 1
performers, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
it., 1
The, 1
opera, 1
of, 1
"Parisina", 1
was, 1
announced, 1
for, 1
representation,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
actors, 1
were, 1
Coselli,, 1
Moriani,, 1
and, 1
La, 1
Specchia., 1
The, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
therefore,, 1
had, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
consider, 1
themselves, 1
fortunate, 1
in, 1
having, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
works, 1
by, 1
the, 1
composer, 1
of, 1
"Lucia, 1
di, 1
Lammermoor,", 1
supported, 1
by, 1
three, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
renowned, 1
vocalists, 1
of, 1
Italy., 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
theatres,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
orchestras, 1
from, 1
which, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
balconies,, 1
or, 1
open, 1
boxes;, 1
all, 1
these, 1
defects, 1
pressed, 1
hard, 1
on, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
had, 1
his, 1
stall, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Bouffes,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
shared, 1
a, 1
lower, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Opera., 1
Still,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
this,, 1
Albert, 1
displayed, 1
his, 1
most, 1
dazzling, 1
and, 1
effective, 1
costumes, 1
each, 1
time, 1
he, 1
visited, 1
the, 1
theatres;, 1
but,, 1
alas,, 1
his, 1
elegant, 1
toilet, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
thrown, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
worthy, 1
representatives, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
fashion, 1
had, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
with, 1
him, 1
the, 1
mortifying, 1
reflection, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
nearly, 1
overrun, 1
Italy, 1
without, 1
meeting, 1
with, 1
a, 1
single, 1
adventure., 1
Sometimes, 1
Albert, 1
would, 1
affect, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
joke, 1
of, 1
his, 1
want, 1
of, 1
success;, 1
but, 1
internally, 1
he, 1
was, 1
deeply, 1
wounded,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
self-love, 1
immensely, 1
piqued,, 1
to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
admired, 1
and, 1
most, 1
sought, 1
after, 1
of, 1
any, 1
young, 1
person, 1
of, 1
his, 1
day,, 1
should, 1
thus, 1
be, 1
passed, 1
over,, 1
and, 1
merely, 1
have, 1
his, 1
labor, 1
for, 1
his, 1
pains., 1
And, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
was, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
more, 1
annoying,, 1
as,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
characteristic, 1
modesty, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Frenchman,, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
quitted, 1
Paris, 1
with, 1
the, 1
full, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
show, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
Italy, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
all, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
return, 1
he, 1
should, 1
astonish, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
world, 1
with, 1
the, 1
recital, 1
of, 1
his, 1
numerous, 1
love-affairs., 1
Alas,, 1
poor, 1
Albert!, 1
none, 1
of, 1
those, 1
interesting, 1
adventures, 1
fell, 1
in, 1
his, 1
way;, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
Genoese,, 1
Florentines,, 1
and, 1
Neapolitans, 1
were, 1
all, 1
faithful,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
to, 1
their, 1
husbands,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
to, 1
their, 1
lovers,, 1
and, 1
thought, 1
not, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
even, 1
for, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf;, 1
and, 1
all, 1
he, 1
gained, 1
was, 1
the, 1
painful, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
of, 1
Italy, 1
have, 1
this, 1
advantage, 1
over, 1
those, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
are, 1
faithful, 1
even, 1
in, 1
their, 1
infidelity., 1
Yet, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
restrain, 1
a, 1
hope, 1
that, 1
in, 1
Italy,, 1
as, 1
elsewhere,, 1
there, 1
might, 1
be, 1
an, 1
exception, 1
to, 1
the, 1
general, 1
rule., 1
Albert,, 1
besides, 1
being, 1
an, 1
elegant,, 1
well-looking, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
was, 1
also, 1
possessed, 1
of, 1
considerable, 1
talent, 1
and, 1
ability;, 1
moreover,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
viscount--a, 1
recently, 1
created, 1
one,, 1
certainly,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
present, 1
day, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
go, 1
as, 1
far, 1
back, 1
as, 1
Noah, 1
in, 1
tracing, 1
a, 1
descent,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
genealogical, 1
tree, 1
is, 1
equally, 1
estimated,, 1
whether, 1
dated, 1
from, 1
1399, 1
or, 1
merely, 1
1815;, 1
but, 1
to, 1
crown, 1
all, 1
these, 1
advantages,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
commanded, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
50,000, 1
livres,, 1
a, 1
more, 1
than, 1
sufficient, 1
sum, 1
to, 1
render, 1
him, 1
a, 1
personage, 1
of, 1
considerable, 1
importance, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
It, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
no, 1
small, 1
mortification, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
have, 1
visited, 1
most, 1
of, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
cities, 1
in, 1
Italy, 1
without, 1
having, 1
excited, 1
the, 1
most, 1
trifling, 1
observation., 1
Albert,, 1
however,, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
indemnify, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
all, 1
these, 1
slights, 1
and, 1
indifferences, 1
during, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
knowing, 1
full, 1
well, 1
that, 1
among, 1
the, 1
different, 1
states, 1
and, 1
kingdoms, 1
in, 1
which, 1
this, 1
festivity, 1
is, 1
celebrated,, 1
Rome, 1
is, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
even, 1
the, 1
wisest, 1
and, 1
gravest, 1
throw, 1
off, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
rigidity, 1
of, 1
their, 1
lives,, 1
and, 1
deign, 1
to, 1
mingle, 1
in, 1
the, 1
follies, 1
of, 1
this, 1
time, 1
of, 1
liberty, 1
and, 1
relaxation., 1
The, 1
Carnival, 1
was, 1
to, 1
commence, 1
on, 1
the, 1
morrow;, 1
therefore, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
not, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
in, 1
setting, 1
forth, 1
the, 1
programme, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hopes,, 1
expectations,, 1
and, 1
claims, 1
to, 1
notice., 1
With, 1
this, 1
design, 1
he, 1
had, 1
engaged, 1
a, 1
box, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
conspicuous, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
theatre,, 1
and, 1
exerted, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
set, 1
off, 1
his, 1
personal, 1
attractions, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
elaborate, 1
toilet., 1
The, 1
box, 1
taken, 1
by, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
circle;, 1
although, 1
each, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
tiers, 1
of, 1
boxes, 1
is, 1
deemed, 1
equally, 1
aristocratic,, 1
and, 1
is,, 1
for, 1
this, 1
reason,, 1
generally, 1
styled, 1
the, 1
"nobility's, 1
boxes,", 1
and, 1
although, 1
the, 1
box, 1
engaged, 1
for, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
was, 1
sufficiently, 1
capacious, 1
to, 1
contain, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
persons,, 1
it, 1
had, 1
cost, 1
less, 1
than, 1
would, 1
be, 1
paid, 1
at, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
French, 1
theatres, 1
for, 1
one, 1
admitting, 1
merely, 1
four, 1
occupants., 1
Another, 1
motive, 1
had, 1
influenced, 1
Albert's, 1
selection, 1
of, 1
his, 1
seat,--who, 1
knew, 1
but, 1
that,, 1
thus, 1
advantageously, 1
placed,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
in, 1
truth, 1
attract, 1
the, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
some, 1
fair, 1
Roman,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
introduction, 1
might, 1
ensue, 1
that, 1
would, 1
procure, 1
him, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
of, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
in, 1
a, 1
carriage,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
place, 1
in, 1
a, 1
princely, 1
balcony,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
he, 1
might, 1
behold, 1
the, 1
gayeties, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival?, 1
These, 1
united, 1
considerations, 1
made, 1
Albert, 1
more, 1
lively, 1
and, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
please, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
been., 1
Totally, 1
disregarding, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stage,, 1
he, 1
leaned, 1
from, 1
his, 1
box, 1
and, 1
began, 1
attentively, 1
scrutinizing, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
each, 1
pretty, 1
woman,, 1
aided, 1
by, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
opera-glass;, 1
but,, 1
alas,, 1
this, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
attract, 1
notice, 1
wholly, 1
failed;, 1
not, 1
even, 1
curiosity, 1
had, 1
been, 1
excited,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
but, 1
too, 1
apparent, 1
that, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
creatures,, 1
into, 1
whose, 1
good, 1
graces, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
stealing,, 1
were, 1
all, 1
so, 1
much, 1
engrossed, 1
with, 1
themselves,, 1
their, 1
lovers,, 1
or, 1
their, 1
own, 1
thoughts,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
not, 1
so, 1
much, 1
as, 1
noticed, 1
him, 1
or, 1
the, 1
manipulation, 1
of, 1
his, 1
glass., 1
The, 1
truth, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
anticipated, 1
pleasures, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
"holy, 1
week", 1
that, 1
was, 1
to, 1
succeed, 1
it,, 1
so, 1
filled, 1
every, 1
fair, 1
breast,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
least, 1
attention, 1
being, 1
bestowed, 1
even, 1
on, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stage., 1
The, 1
actors, 1
made, 1
their, 1
entries, 1
and, 1
exits, 1
unobserved, 1
or, 1
unthought, 1
of;, 1
at, 1
certain, 1
conventional, 1
moments,, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
would, 1
suddenly, 1
cease, 1
their, 1
conversation,, 1
or, 1
rouse, 1
themselves, 1
from, 1
their, 1
musings,, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
some, 1
brilliant, 1
effort, 1
of, 1
Moriani's,, 1
a, 1
well-executed, 1
recitative, 1
by, 1
Coselli,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
join, 1
in, 1
loud, 1
applause, 1
at, 1
the, 1
wonderful, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Specchia;, 1
but, 1
that, 1
momentary, 1
excitement, 1
over,, 1
they, 1
quickly, 1
relapsed, 1
into, 1
their, 1
former, 1
state, 1
of, 1
preoccupation, 1
or, 1
interesting, 1
conversation., 1
Towards, 1
the, 1
close, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
a, 1
box, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
hitherto, 1
vacant, 1
was, 1
opened;, 1
a, 1
lady, 1
entered, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
been, 1
introduced, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
where, 1
indeed,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
imagined, 1
she, 1
still, 1
was., 1
The, 1
quick, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Albert, 1
caught, 1
the, 1
involuntary, 1
start, 1
with, 1
which, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
new, 1
arrival,, 1
and,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
hastily,, 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
has, 1
just, 1
entered, 1
that, 1
box?", 1
"Yes;, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
her?", 1
"Oh,, 1
she, 1
is, 1
perfectly, 1
lovely--what, 1
a, 1
complexion!, 1
And, 1
such, 1
magnificent, 1
hair!, 1
Is, 1
she, 1
French?", 1
"No;, 1
a, 1
Venetian.", 1
"And, 1
her, 1
name, 1
is--", 1
"Countess, 1
G----.", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
her, 1
by, 1
name!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert;, 1
"she, 1
is, 1
said, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
as, 1
much, 1
wit, 1
and, 1
cleverness, 1
as, 1
beauty., 1
I, 1
was, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
her, 1
when, 1
I, 1
met, 1
her, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
Villefort's, 1
ball.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
assist, 1
you, 1
in, 1
repairing, 1
your, 1
negligence?", 1
asked, 1
Franz., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
really, 1
on, 1
such, 1
good, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
her, 1
as, 1
to, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
take, 1
me, 1
to, 1
her, 1
box?", 1
"Why,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
only, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
being, 1
in, 1
her, 1
society, 1
and, 1
conversing, 1
with, 1
her, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
times, 1
in, 1
my, 1
life;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
even, 1
such, 1
an, 1
acquaintance, 1
as, 1
that, 1
might, 1
warrant, 1
my, 1
doing, 1
what, 1
you, 1
ask.", 1
At, 1
that, 1
instant,, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
perceived, 1
Franz,, 1
and, 1
graciously, 1
waved, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
respectful, 1
inclination, 1
of, 1
the, 1
head., 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
be, 1
on, 1
excellent, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
countess.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
mistaken, 1
in, 1
thinking, 1
so,", 1
returned, 1
Franz, 1
calmly;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
merely, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
the, 1
same, 1
error, 1
which, 1
leads, 1
so, 1
many, 1
of, 1
our, 1
countrymen, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
the, 1
most, 1
egregious, 1
blunders,--I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
of, 1
judging, 1
the, 1
habits, 1
and, 1
customs, 1
of, 1
Italy, 1
and, 1
Spain, 1
by, 1
our, 1
Parisian, 1
notions;, 1
believe, 1
me,, 1
nothing, 1
is, 1
more, 1
fallacious, 1
than, 1
to, 1
form, 1
any, 1
estimate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
intimacy, 1
you, 1
may, 1
suppose, 1
existing, 1
among, 1
persons, 1
by, 1
the, 1
familiar, 1
terms, 1
they, 1
seem, 1
upon;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
similarity, 1
of, 1
feeling, 1
at, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
between, 1
ourselves, 1
and, 1
the, 1
countess--nothing, 1
more.", 1
"Is, 1
there,, 1
indeed,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow?, 1
Pray, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
sympathy, 1
of, 1
heart?", 1
"No;, 1
of, 1
taste,", 1
continued, 1
Franz, 1
gravely., 1
"And, 1
in, 1
what, 1
manner, 1
has, 1
this, 1
congeniality, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
been, 1
evinced?", 1
"By, 1
the, 1
countess's, 1
visiting, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
did, 1
last, 1
night,, 1
by, 1
moonlight,, 1
and, 1
nearly, 1
alone.", 1
"You, 1
were, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
then?", 1
"I, 1
was.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
say, 1
to, 1
her?", 1
"Oh,, 1
we, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
dead, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
that, 1
magnificent, 1
ruin, 1
is, 1
a, 1
glorious, 1
monument!", 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
very, 1
entertaining, 1
companion, 1
alone,, 1
or, 1
all, 1
but, 1
alone,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
woman, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
place, 1
of, 1
sentiment, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
to, 1
find, 1
nothing, 1
better, 1
a, 1
talk, 1
about, 1
than, 1
the, 1
dead!, 1
All, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
is,, 1
if, 1
ever, 1
I, 1
should, 1
get, 1
such, 1
a, 1
chance,, 1
the, 1
living, 1
should, 1
be, 1
my, 1
theme.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
will, 1
probably, 1
find, 1
your, 1
theme, 1
ill-chosen.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
breaking, 1
in, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
discourse,, 1
"never, 1
mind, 1
the, 1
past;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
only, 1
remember, 1
the, 1
present., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
going, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
your, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
introducing, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
our, 1
remarks?", 1
"Certainly,, 1
directly, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
falls, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stage.", 1
"What, 1
a, 1
confounded, 1
time, 1
this, 1
first, 1
act, 1
takes., 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
never, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
it.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
they, 1
will;, 1
only, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
that, 1
charming, 1
finale., 1
How, 1
exquisitely, 1
Coselli, 1
sings, 1
his, 1
part.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
an, 1
awkward,, 1
inelegant, 1
fellow, 1
he, 1
is.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say, 1
to, 1
La, 1
Specchia?, 1
Did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
see, 1
anything, 1
more, 1
perfect, 1
than, 1
her, 1
acting?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1
when, 1
one, 1
has, 1
been, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
Malibran, 1
and, 1
Sontag,, 1
such, 1
singers, 1
as, 1
these, 1
don't, 1
make, 1
the, 1
same, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
you, 1
they, 1
perhaps, 1
do, 1
on, 1
others.", 1
"At, 1
least,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
admire, 1
Moriani's, 1
style, 1
and, 1
execution.", 1
"I, 1
never, 1
fancied, 1
men, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dark,, 1
ponderous, 1
appearance, 1
singing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
like, 1
a, 1
woman's.", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
while, 1
Albert, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
point, 1
his, 1
glass, 1
at, 1
every, 1
box, 1
in, 1
the, 1
theatre,, 1
"you, 1
seem, 1
determined, 1
not, 1
to, 1
approve;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
too, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
please.", 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
at, 1
length, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
the, 1
performances,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
infinite, 1
satisfaction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Viscount, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
rapidly, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
through, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
arranged, 1
his, 1
cravat, 1
and, 1
wristbands,, 1
and, 1
signified, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
the, 1
way., 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
mutely, 1
interrogated, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
and, 1
received, 1
from, 1
her, 1
a, 1
gracious, 1
smile, 1
in, 1
token, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
welcome,, 1
sought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
retard, 1
the, 1
gratification, 1
of, 1
Albert's, 1
eager, 1
impatience,, 1
but, 1
began, 1
at, 1
once, 1
the, 1
tour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
closely, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
availed, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
the, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
required, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
theatre, 1
to, 1
settle, 1
the, 1
height, 1
and, 1
smoothness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
collar,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
arrange, 1
the, 1
lappets, 1
of, 1
his, 1
coat., 1
This, 1
important, 1
task, 1
was, 1
just, 1
completed, 1
as, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
countess's, 1
box., 1
At, 1
the, 1
knock,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
in, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
custom,, 1
instantly, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
surrendered, 1
his, 1
place, 1
to, 1
the, 1
strangers,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
turn,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
retire, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
other, 1
visitors., 1
Franz, 1
presented, 1
Albert, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
distinguished, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
both, 1
as, 1
regarded, 1
his, 1
position, 1
in, 1
society, 1
and, 1
extraordinary, 1
talents;, 1
nor, 1
did, 1
he, 1
say, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
for, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
and, 1
the, 1
circle, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
viscount, 1
moved,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
and, 1
cited, 1
as, 1
a, 1
model, 1
of, 1
perfection., 1
Franz, 1
added, 1
that, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
deeply, 1
grieved, 1
at, 1
having, 1
been, 1
prevented, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
being, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
during, 1
her, 1
sojourn, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
was, 1
most, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
requested, 1
him, 1
(Franz), 1
to, 1
remedy, 1
the, 1
past, 1
misfortune, 1
by, 1
conducting, 1
him, 1
to, 1
her, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
concluded, 1
by, 1
asking, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
his, 1
presumption, 1
in, 1
having, 1
taken, 1
it, 1
upon, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
The, 1
countess,, 1
in, 1
reply,, 1
bowed, 1
gracefully, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
cordial, 1
kindness, 1
to, 1
Franz;, 1
then,, 1
inviting, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
vacant, 1
seat, 1
beside, 1
her,, 1
she, 1
recommended, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
next, 1
best,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
view, 1
the, 1
ballet,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
one, 1
behind, 1
her, 1
own, 1
chair., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
deeply, 1
engrossed, 1
in, 1
discoursing, 1
upon, 1
Paris, 1
and, 1
Parisian, 1
matters,, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
of, 1
the, 1
various, 1
persons, 1
they, 1
both, 1
knew, 1
there., 1
Franz, 1
perceived, 1
how, 1
completely, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
element;, 1
and,, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
he, 1
so, 1
evidently, 1
felt,, 1
took, 1
up, 1
Albert's, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
survey, 1
the, 1
audience., 1
Sitting, 1
alone,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
a, 1
box, 1
immediately, 1
opposite,, 1
but, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third, 1
row,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
exquisite, 1
beauty,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
Greek, 1
costume,, 1
which, 1
evidently,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ease, 1
and, 1
grace, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
wore, 1
it,, 1
was, 1
her, 1
national, 1
attire., 1
Behind, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
shadow,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
outline, 1
of, 1
a, 1
masculine, 1
figure;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
this, 1
latter, 1
personage, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
distinguish., 1
Franz, 1
could, 1
not, 1
forbear, 1
breaking, 1
in, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
apparently, 1
interesting, 1
conversation, 1
passing, 1
between, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
and, 1
Albert,, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
of, 1
the, 1
former, 1
if, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
who, 1
was, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
Albanian, 1
opposite,, 1
since, 1
beauty, 1
such, 1
as, 1
hers, 1
was, 1
well, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
being, 1
observed, 1
by, 1
either, 1
sex., 1
"All, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
about, 1
her,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"is,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
has, 1
been, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
since, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
season;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
where, 1
she, 1
now, 1
sits, 1
the, 1
very, 1
first, 1
night, 1
of, 1
the, 1
season,, 1
and, 1
since, 1
then, 1
she, 1
has, 1
never, 1
missed, 1
a, 1
performance., 1
Sometimes, 1
she, 1
is, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
is, 1
now, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
others, 1
she, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
attended, 1
by, 1
a, 1
black, 1
servant.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
her, 1
personal, 1
appearance?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
her, 1
perfectly, 1
lovely--she, 1
is, 1
just, 1
my, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
what, 1
Medora, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been.", 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
resumed, 1
her, 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
Albert,, 1
while, 1
Franz, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
previous, 1
survey, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
and, 1
company., 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
rose, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ballet,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
excellent, 1
specimens, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
school,, 1
admirably, 1
arranged, 1
and, 1
put, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stage, 1
by, 1
Henri,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
established, 1
for, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
great, 1
reputation, 1
throughout, 1
Italy, 1
for, 1
his, 1
taste, 1
and, 1
skill, 1
in, 1
the, 1
choreographic, 1
art--one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
masterly, 1
productions, 1
of, 1
grace,, 1
method,, 1
and, 1
elegance, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
corps, 1
de, 1
ballet,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
dancers, 1
to, 1
the, 1
humblest, 1
supernumerary,, 1
are, 1
all, 1
engaged, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stage, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time;, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
persons, 1
may, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
exhibiting, 1
the, 1
same, 1
attitude,, 1
or, 1
elevating, 1
the, 1
same, 1
arm, 1
or, 1
leg, 1
with, 1
a, 1
simultaneous, 1
movement,, 1
that, 1
would, 1
lead, 1
you, 1
to, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
but, 1
one, 1
mind,, 1
one, 1
act, 1
of, 1
volition,, 1
influenced, 1
the, 1
moving, 1
mass--the, 1
ballet, 1
was, 1
called, 1
"Poliska.", 1
However, 1
much, 1
the, 1
ballet, 1
might, 1
have, 1
claimed, 1
his, 1
attention,, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
too, 1
deeply, 1
occupied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek, 1
to, 1
take, 1
any, 1
note, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
while, 1
she, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
experience, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
childlike, 1
delight, 1
in, 1
watching, 1
it,, 1
her, 1
eager,, 1
animated, 1
looks, 1
contrasting, 1
strongly, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utter, 1
indifference, 1
of, 1
her, 1
companion,, 1
who,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
time, 1
the, 1
piece, 1
lasted,, 1
never, 1
even, 1
moved,, 1
not, 1
even, 1
when, 1
the, 1
furious,, 1
crashing, 1
din, 1
produced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
trumpets,, 1
cymbals,, 1
and, 1
Chinese, 1
bells, 1
sounded, 1
their, 1
loudest, 1
from, 1
the, 1
orchestra., 1
Of, 1
this, 1
he, 1
took, 1
no, 1
heed,, 1
but, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
appearances, 1
might, 1
be, 1
trusted,, 1
enjoying, 1
soft, 1
repose, 1
and, 1
bright, 1
celestial, 1
dreams., 1
The, 1
ballet, 1
at, 1
length, 1
came, 1
to, 1
a, 1
close,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
fell, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
loud,, 1
unanimous, 1
plaudits, 1
of, 1
an, 1
enthusiastic, 1
and, 1
delighted, 1
audience., 1
Owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
judicious, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
dividing, 1
the, 1
two, 1
acts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
with, 1
a, 1
ballet,, 1
the, 1
pauses, 1
between, 1
the, 1
performances, 1
are, 1
very, 1
short,, 1
the, 1
singers, 1
in, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
having, 1
time, 1
to, 1
repose, 1
themselves, 1
and, 1
change, 1
their, 1
costume,, 1
when, 1
necessary,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
dancers, 1
are, 1
executing, 1
their, 1
pirouettes, 1
and, 1
exhibiting, 1
their, 1
graceful, 1
steps., 1
The, 1
overture, 1
to, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act, 1
began;, 1
and,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
leader's, 1
bow, 1
across, 1
his, 1
violin,, 1
Franz, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
sleeper, 1
slowly, 1
arise, 1
and, 1
approach, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
turned, 1
around, 1
to, 1
say, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
leaning, 1
forward, 1
again, 1
on, 1
the, 1
railing, 1
of, 1
her, 1
box,, 1
she, 1
became, 1
as, 1
absorbed, 1
as, 1
before, 1
in, 1
what, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on., 1
The, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
had, 1
addressed, 1
her, 1
remained, 1
so, 1
completely, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shade,, 1
that,, 1
though, 1
Franz, 1
tried, 1
his, 1
utmost,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
distinguish, 1
a, 1
single, 1
feature., 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
actors;, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
turned, 1
from, 1
the, 1
box, 1
containing, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
girl, 1
and, 1
her, 1
strange, 1
companion, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stage., 1
Most, 1
of, 1
my, 1
readers, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act, 1
of, 1
"Parisina", 1
opens, 1
with, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
and, 1
effective, 1
duet, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Parisina,, 1
while, 1
sleeping,, 1
betrays, 1
to, 1
Azzo, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
her, 1
love, 1
for, 1
Ugo., 1
The, 1
injured, 1
husband, 1
goes, 1
through, 1
all, 1
the, 1
emotions, 1
of, 1
jealousy,, 1
until, 1
conviction, 1
seizes, 1
on, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
frenzy, 1
of, 1
rage, 1
and, 1
indignation,, 1
he, 1
awakens, 1
his, 1
guilty, 1
wife, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
her, 1
that, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
her, 1
guilt, 1
and, 1
to, 1
threaten, 1
her, 1
with, 1
his, 1
vengeance., 1
This, 1
duet, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
beautiful,, 1
expressive, 1
and, 1
terrible, 1
conceptions, 1
that, 1
has, 1
ever, 1
emanated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fruitful, 1
pen, 1
of, 1
Donizetti., 1
Franz, 1
now, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
it, 1
for, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time;, 1
yet, 1
its, 1
notes,, 1
so, 1
tenderly, 1
expressive, 1
and, 1
fearfully, 1
grand, 1
as, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
husband, 1
and, 1
wife, 1
give, 1
vent, 1
to, 1
their, 1
different, 1
griefs, 1
and, 1
passions,, 1
thrilled, 1
through, 1
the, 1
soul, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
an, 1
effect, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
his, 1
first, 1
emotions, 1
upon, 1
hearing, 1
it., 1
Excited, 1
beyond, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
calm, 1
demeanor,, 1
Franz, 1
rose, 1
with, 1
the, 1
audience,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
join, 1
the, 1
loud,, 1
enthusiastic, 1
applause, 1
that, 1
followed;, 1
but, 1
suddenly, 1
his, 1
purpose, 1
was, 1
arrested,, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
fell, 1
by, 1
his, 1
sides,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
half-uttered, 1
"bravos", 1
expired, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
The, 1
occupant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
girl, 1
sat, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
share, 1
the, 1
universal, 1
admiration, 1
that, 1
prevailed;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
left, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
up, 1
in, 1
front,, 1
so, 1
that,, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
being, 1
fully, 1
revealed,, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
no, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
recognizing, 1
him, 1
as, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
inhabitant, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
very, 1
same, 1
person, 1
he, 1
had, 1
encountered, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
evening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ruins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
figure, 1
had, 1
seemed, 1
so, 1
familiar, 1
to, 1
him., 1
All, 1
doubt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
identity, 1
was, 1
now, 1
at, 1
an, 1
end;, 1
his, 1
singular, 1
host, 1
evidently, 1
resided, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
The, 1
surprise, 1
and, 1
agitation, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
this, 1
full, 1
confirmation, 1
of, 1
Franz's, 1
former, 1
suspicion, 1
had, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
imparted, 1
a, 1
corresponding, 1
expression, 1
to, 1
his, 1
features;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
after, 1
gazing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
puzzled, 1
look, 1
at, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
laughter,, 1
and, 1
begged, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
"Countess,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
totally, 1
unheeding, 1
her, 1
raillery,, 1
"I, 1
asked, 1
you, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
since, 1
if, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
any, 1
particulars, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
Albanian, 1
lady, 1
opposite;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
now, 1
beseech, 1
you, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
me, 1
who, 1
and, 1
what, 1
is, 1
her, 1
husband?", 1
"Nay,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
no, 1
more, 1
of, 1
him, 1
than, 1
yourself.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
you, 1
never, 1
before, 1
noticed, 1
him?", 1
"What, 1
a, 1
question--so, 1
truly, 1
French!, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
we, 1
Italians, 1
have, 1
eyes, 1
only, 1
for, 1
the, 1
man, 1
we, 1
love?", 1
"True,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"All, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
is,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
the, 1
lorgnette,, 1
and, 1
directing, 1
it, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
box, 1
in, 1
question,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
gentleman,, 1
whose, 1
history, 1
I, 1
am, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
furnish,, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
been, 1
dug, 1
up;, 1
he, 1
looks, 1
more, 1
like, 1
a, 1
corpse, 1
permitted, 1
by, 1
some, 1
friendly, 1
grave-digger, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
his, 1
tomb, 1
for, 1
a, 1
while,, 1
and, 1
revisit, 1
this, 1
earth, 1
of, 1
ours,, 1
than, 1
anything, 1
human., 1
How, 1
ghastly, 1
pale, 1
he, 1
is!", 1
"Oh,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
always, 1
as, 1
colorless, 1
as, 1
you, 1
now, 1
see, 1
him,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
know, 1
him?", 1
almost, 1
screamed, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"Oh,, 1
pray, 1
do,, 1
for, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
all, 1
about--is, 1
he, 1
a, 1
vampire,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
resuscitated, 1
corpse,, 1
or, 1
what?", 1
"I, 1
fancy, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
before;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
even, 1
think, 1
he, 1
recognizes, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
can, 1
well, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
shrugging, 1
up, 1
her, 1
beautiful, 1
shoulders,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
an, 1
involuntary, 1
shudder, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
her, 1
veins,, 1
"that, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
once, 1
seen, 1
that, 1
man, 1
will, 1
never, 1
be, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
him.", 1
The, 1
sensation, 1
experienced, 1
by, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
not, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
himself;, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
wholly, 1
uninterested, 1
person,, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
same, 1
unaccountable, 1
awe, 1
and, 1
misgiving., 1
"Well.", 1
inquired, 1
Franz,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
had, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time, 1
directed, 1
her, 1
lorgnette, 1
at, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
our, 1
opposite, 1
neighbor?", 1
"Why,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
living, 1
form.", 1
This, 1
fresh, 1
allusion, 1
to, 1
Byron, 1
[*], 1
drew, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
to, 1
Franz's, 1
countenance;, 1
although, 1
he, 1
could, 1
but, 1
allow, 1
that, 1
if, 1
anything, 1
was, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
induce, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
the, 1
existence, 1
of, 1
vampires,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
as, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
personage, 1
before, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
must, 1
positively, 1
find, 1
out, 1
who, 1
and, 1
what, 1
he, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
rising, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
"you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
me., 1
I, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
you, 1
to, 1
escort, 1

yet, 1
more, 1
unfortunate, 1
family,, 1
bore, 1
in, 1
his, 1
looks, 1
that, 1
cast, 1
of, 1
inauspicious, 1
melancholy, 1
by, 1
which, 1
the, 1
physiognomists, 1
of, 1

to, 1

xxii., 1
"Is, 1

you, 1
entertain, 1
any, 1
fear?", 1
"I'll, 1
tell, 1
you,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"Byron, 1
had, 1
the, 1
most, 1
perfect, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
the, 1
existence, 1
of, 1
vampires,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
assured, 1
me, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
them., 1
The, 1
description, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
perfectly, 1
corresponds, 1
with, 1
the, 1
features, 1
and, 1
character, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
before, 1
us., 1
Oh,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
the, 1
exact, 1
personification, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
led, 1
to, 1
expect!, 1
The, 1
coal-black, 1
hair,, 1
large, 1
bright,, 1
glittering, 1
eyes,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
wild,, 1
unearthly, 1
fire, 1
seems, 1
burning,--the, 1
same, 1
ghastly, 1
paleness., 1
Then, 1
observe,, 1
too,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
with, 1
him, 1
is, 1
altogether, 1
unlike, 1
all, 1
others, 1
of, 1
her, 1
sex., 1
She, 1
is, 1
a, 1
foreigner--a, 1
stranger., 1
Nobody, 1
knows, 1
who, 1
she, 1
is,, 1
or, 1
where, 1
she, 1
comes, 1
from., 1
No, 1
doubt, 1
she, 1
belongs, 1
to, 1
the, 1
same, 1
horrible, 1
race, 1
he, 1
does,, 1
and, 1
is,, 1
like, 1
himself,, 1
a, 1
dealer, 1
in, 1
magical, 1
arts., 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
of, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
go, 1
near, 1

if, 1
to-morrow, 1
your, 1
curiosity, 1
still, 1
continues, 1
as, 1
great,, 1

your, 1
researches, 1

you, 1
will;, 1

to-night, 1
you, 1
neither, 1
can, 1
nor, 1

For, 1
that, 1
purpose, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
you, 1
all, 1
to, 1

Franz, 1
protested, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
defer, 1
his, 1
pursuit, 1
till, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day,, 1
for, 1
many, 1
reasons., 1
"Listen, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
very, 1
headstrong., 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
home., 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1

Now,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
for, 1
one, 1
instant, 1

you, 1
so, 1
devoid, 1
of, 1
gallantry, 1
as, 1
to, 1
refuse, 1
a, 1
lady, 1
your, 1
escort, 1
when, 1
she, 1
even, 1
condescends, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
for, 1
it.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
else, 1
left, 1
for, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
do, 1
but, 1
to, 1
take, 1
up, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
offer, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
his, 1
arm., 1
It, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
evident,, 1
by, 1
her, 1
manner,, 1
that, 1
her, 1
uneasiness, 1
was, 1
not, 1
feigned;, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
himself, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
superstitious, 1
dread--so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
stronger, 1
in, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
a, 1
variety, 1
of, 1
corroborative, 1
recollections,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
sprang, 1
from, 1
an, 1
instinctive, 1
belief,, 1
originally, 1
created, 1
in, 1
her, 1
mind, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wild, 1
tales, 1
she, 1
had, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
till, 1
she, 1
believed, 1
them, 1
truths., 1
Franz, 1
could, 1
even, 1
feel, 1
her, 1
arm, 1
tremble, 1
as, 1
he, 1
assisted, 1
her, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Upon, 1
arriving, 1
at, 1
her, 1
hotel,, 1
Franz, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
deceived, 1
him, 1
when, 1
she, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1
expecting, 1
company;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
her, 1
own, 1
return, 1
before, 1
the, 1
appointed, 1
hour, 1
seemed, 1
greatly, 1
to, 1
astonish, 1
the, 1
servants., 1
"Excuse, 1
my, 1
little, 1
subterfuge,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
in, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
her, 1
companion's, 1
half-reproachful, 1
observation, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
horrid, 1
man, 1
had, 1
made, 1
me, 1
feel, 1
quite, 1
uncomfortable,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
longed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alone,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
compose, 1
my, 1
startled, 1
mind.", 1
Franz, 1
essayed, 1
to, 1
smile., 1
"Nay,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
smile;, 1
it, 1
ill, 1
accords, 1
with, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
your, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
it, 1
does, 1
not, 1
spring, 1
from, 1
your, 1
heart., 1
However,, 1
promise, 1
me, 1
one, 1
thing.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"Promise, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
say.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
anything, 1
you, 1
desire,, 1
except, 1
relinquish, 1
my, 1
determination, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
out, 1
who, 1
this, 1
man, 1
is., 1
I, 1
have, 1
more, 1
reasons, 1
than, 1
you, 1
can, 1
imagine, 1
for, 1
desiring, 1
to, 1
know, 1
who, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
is, 1
going.", 1
"Where, 1
he, 1
comes, 1
from, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ignorant;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
can, 1
readily, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
down, 1
below,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
least, 1
doubt.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
only, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
wished, 1
me, 1
to, 1
make,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
give, 1
me, 1
your, 1
word, 1
to, 1
return, 1
immediately, 1
to, 1
your, 1
hotel,, 1
and, 1
make, 1
no, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
this, 1
man, 1
to-night., 1
There, 1
are, 1
certain, 1
affinities, 1
between, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
we, 1
quit, 1
and, 1
those, 1
we, 1
meet, 1
afterwards., 1
For, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
serve, 1
as, 1
a, 1
conductor, 1
between, 1
that, 1
man, 1
and, 1
me., 1
Pursue, 1
your, 1
chase, 1
after, 1
him, 1
to-morrow, 1
as, 1
eagerly, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
but, 1
never, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
near, 1
me,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
see, 1
me, 1
die, 1
of, 1
terror., 1
And, 1
now,, 1
good-night;, 1
go, 1
to, 1
your, 1
rooms,, 1
and, 1
try, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
away, 1
all, 1
recollections, 1
of, 1
this, 1
evening., 1
For, 1
my, 1
own, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
close, 1
my, 1
eyes.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
quitted, 1
Franz,, 1
leaving, 1
him, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
decide, 1
whether, 1
she, 1
were, 1
merely, 1
amusing, 1
herself, 1
at, 1
his, 1
expense,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
her, 1
fears, 1
and, 1
agitations, 1
were, 1
genuine., 1
Upon, 1
his, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
Franz, 1
found, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
his, 1
dressing-gown, 1
and, 1
slippers,, 1
listlessly, 1
extended, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sofa,, 1
smoking, 1
a, 1
cigar., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow.", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
springing, 1
up,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
really, 1
you?, 1
Why,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
before, 1
to-morrow.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
glad, 1
of, 1
this, 1
opportunity, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
once, 1
and, 1
forever,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
entertain, 1
a, 1
most, 1
erroneous, 1
notion, 1
concerning, 1
Italian, 1
women., 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
continual, 1
failures, 1
you, 1
have, 1
met, 1
with, 1
in, 1
all, 1
your, 1
own, 1
love, 1
affairs, 1
might, 1
have, 1
taught, 1
you, 1
better, 1
by, 1
this, 1
time.", 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
these, 1
women, 1
would, 1
puzzle, 1
the, 1
very, 1
Devil, 1
to, 1
read, 1
them, 1
aright., 1
Why,, 1
here--they, 1
give, 1
you, 1
their, 1
hand--they, 1
press, 1
yours, 1
in, 1
return--they, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
a, 1
whispering, 1
conversation--permit, 1
you, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
them, 1
home., 1
Why,, 1
if, 1
a, 1
Parisian, 1
were, 1
to, 1
indulge, 1
in, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
these, 1
marks, 1
of, 1
flattering, 1
attention,, 1
her, 1
reputation, 1
would, 1
be, 1
gone, 1
forever.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
very, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
this, 1
fine, 1
country, 1
put, 1
so, 1
little, 1
restraint, 1
on, 1
their, 1
words, 1
and, 1
actions,, 1
is, 1
because, 1
they, 1
live, 1
so, 1
much, 1
in, 1
public,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
really, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
conceal., 1
Besides,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
was, 1
really, 1
alarmed.", 1
"At, 1
what?, 1
At, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
that, 1
respectable, 1
gentleman, 1
sitting, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
us, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
box, 1
with, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
Greek, 1
girl?, 1
Now,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
met, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lobby, 1
after, 1
the, 1
conclusion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
piece;, 1
and, 1
hang, 1
me,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
can, 1
guess, 1
where, 1
you, 1
took, 1
your, 1
notions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other, 1
world, 1
from., 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
that, 1
this, 1
hobgoblin, 1
of, 1
yours, 1
is, 1
a, 1
deuced, 1
fine-looking, 1
fellow--admirably, 1
dressed., 1
Indeed,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
quite, 1
sure,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cut, 1
of, 1
his, 1
clothes,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
made, 1
by, 1
a, 1
first-rate, 1
Paris, 1
tailor--probably, 1
Blin, 1
or, 1
Humann., 1
He, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
too, 1
pale,, 1
certainly;, 1
but, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
paleness, 1
is, 1
always, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
aristocratic, 1
descent, 1
and, 1
distinguished, 1
breeding.", 1
Franz, 1
smiled;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
well, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
particularly, 1
prided, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
color, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
complexion., 1
"Well,, 1
that, 1
tends, 1
to, 1
confirm, 1
my, 1
own, 1
ideas,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
countess's, 1
suspicions, 1
were, 1
destitute, 1
alike, 1
of, 1
sense, 1
and, 1
reason., 1
Did, 1
he, 1
speak, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hearing?, 1
and, 1
did, 1
you, 1
catch, 1
any, 1
of, 1
his, 1
words?", 1
"I, 1
did;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
uttered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Romaic, 1
dialect., 1
I, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
from, 1
the, 1
mixture, 1
of, 1
Greek, 1
words., 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
college, 1
I, 1
was, 1
rather--rather, 1
strong, 1
in, 1
Greek.", 1
"He, 1
spoke, 1
the, 1
Romaic, 1
language,, 1
did, 1
he?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so.", 1
"That, 1
settles, 1
it,", 1
murmured, 1
Franz., 1
"'Tis, 1
he,, 1
past, 1
all, 1
doubt.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say?", 1
"Nothing,, 1
nothing., 1
But, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
what, 1
were, 1
you, 1
thinking, 1
about, 1
when, 1
I, 1
came, 1
in?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
arranging, 1
a, 1
little, 1
surprise, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"Indeed., 1
Of, 1
what, 1
nature?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
a, 1
carriage.", 1
"Certainly;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
also, 1
know, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
done, 1
all, 1
that, 1
human, 1
means, 1
afforded, 1
to, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
get, 1
one.", 1
"Now,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
this, 1
difficulty, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
idea, 1
has, 1
flashed, 1
across, 1
my, 1
brain.", 1
Franz, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Albert, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
much, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
the, 1
suggestions, 1
of, 1
his, 1
imagination., 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what,, 1
Sir, 1
Franz,", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
deserve, 1
to, 1
be, 1
called, 1
out, 1
for, 1
such, 1
a, 1
misgiving, 1
and, 1
incredulous, 1
glance, 1
as, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
bestow, 1
on, 1
me, 1
just, 1
now.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
the, 1
satisfaction, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
if, 1
your, 1
scheme, 1
turns, 1
out, 1
as, 1
ingenious, 1
as, 1
you, 1
assert.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
hearken, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
listen.", 1
"You, 1
agree,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
that, 1
obtaining, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
is, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
question?", 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"Neither, 1
can, 1
we, 1
procure, 1
horses?", 1
"True;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
offered, 1
any, 1
sum,, 1
but, 1
have, 1
failed.", 1
"Well,, 1
now,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say, 1
to, 1
a, 1
cart?, 1
I, 1
dare, 1
say, 1
such, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
might, 1
be, 1
had.", 1
"Very, 1
possibly.", 1
"And, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
oxen?", 1
"As, 1
easily, 1
found, 1
as, 1
the, 1
cart.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cart, 1
and, 1
a, 1
couple, 1
of, 1
oxen, 1
our, 1
business, 1
can, 1
be, 1
managed., 1
The, 1
cart, 1
must, 1
be, 1
tastefully, 1
ornamented;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
and, 1
I, 1
dress, 1
ourselves, 1
as, 1
Neapolitan, 1
reapers,, 1
we, 1
may, 1
get, 1
up, 1
a, 1
striking, 1
tableau,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
that, 1
splendid, 1
picture, 1
by, 1
Leopold, 1
Robert., 1
It, 1
would, 1
add, 1
greatly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
if, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
would, 1
join, 1
us, 1
in, 1
the, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
a, 1
peasant, 1
from, 1
Puzzoli, 1
or, 1
Sorrento., 1
Our, 1
group, 1
would, 1
then, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
complete,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
as, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
beautiful, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
represent, 1
a, 1
madonna.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
time,, 1
Albert,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
bound, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
credit, 1
for, 1
having, 1
hit, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
most, 1
capital, 1
idea.", 1
"And, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
national, 1
one,, 1
too,", 1
replied, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
gratified, 1
pride., 1
"A, 1
mere, 1
masque, 1
borrowed, 1
from, 1
our, 1
own, 1
festivities., 1
Ha,, 1
ha,, 1
ye, 1
Romans!, 1
you, 1
thought, 1
to, 1
make, 1
us,, 1
unhappy, 1
strangers,, 1
trot, 1
at, 1
the, 1
heels, 1
of, 1
your, 1
processions,, 1
like, 1
so, 1
many, 1
lazzaroni,, 1
because, 1
no, 1
carriages, 1
or, 1
horses, 1
are, 1
to, 1
be, 1
had, 1
in, 1
your, 1
beggarly, 1
city., 1
But, 1
you, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
us;, 1
when, 1
we, 1
can't, 1
have, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
we, 1
invent, 1
another.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
communicated, 1
your, 1
triumphant, 1
idea, 1
to, 1
anybody?", 1
"Only, 1
to, 1
our, 1
host., 1
Upon, 1
my, 1
return, 1
home, 1
I, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
then, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
him, 1
what, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
procure., 1
He, 1
assured, 1
me, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
would, 1
be, 1
easier, 1
than, 1
to, 1
furnish, 1
all, 1
I, 1
desired., 1
One, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
was, 1
sorry, 1
for;, 1
when, 1
I, 1
bade, 1
him, 1
have, 1
the, 1
horns, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oxen, 1
gilded,, 1
he, 1
told, 1
me, 1
there, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
time,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
would, 1
require, 1
three, 1
days, 1
to, 1
do, 1
that;, 1
so, 1
you, 1
see, 1
we, 1
must, 1
do, 1
without, 1
this, 1
little, 1
superfluity.", 1
"And, 1
where, 1
is, 1
he, 1
now?", 1
"Who?", 1
"Our, 1
host.", 1
"Gone, 1
out, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
our, 1
equipage,, 1
by, 1
to-morrow, 1
it, 1
might, 1
be, 1
too, 1
late.", 1
"Then, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
give, 1
us, 1
an, 1
answer, 1
to-night.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
expect, 1
him, 1
every, 1
minute.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
appeared., 1
"Permesso?", 1
inquired, 1
he., 1
"Certainly--certainly,", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Come, 1
in,, 1
mine, 1
host.", 1
"Now,, 1
then,", 1
asked, 1
Albert, 1
eagerly,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
found, 1
the, 1
desired, 1
cart, 1
and, 1
oxen?", 1
"Better, 1
than, 1
that!", 1
replied, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
perfectly, 1
well, 1
satisfied, 1
with, 1
himself., 1
"Take, 1
care,, 1
my, 1
worthy, 1
host,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"better, 1
is, 1
a, 1
sure, 1
enemy, 1
to, 1
well.", 1
"Let, 1
your, 1
excellencies, 1
only, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
returned, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
indicative, 1
of, 1
unbounded, 1
self-confidence., 1
"But, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
done?", 1
asked, 1
Franz., 1
"Speak, 1
out,, 1
there's, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
fellow.", 1
"Your, 1
excellencies, 1
are, 1
aware,", 1
responded, 1
the, 1
landlord,, 1
swelling, 1
with, 1
importance,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
living, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
floor, 1
with, 1
yourselves!", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
think, 1
we, 1
did, 1
know, 1
it,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert,, 1
"since, 1
it, 1
is, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
that, 1
circumstance, 1
that, 1
we, 1
are, 1
packed, 1
into, 1
these, 1
small, 1
rooms,, 1
like, 1
two, 1
poor, 1
students, 1
in, 1
the, 1
back, 1
streets, 1
of, 1
Paris.", 1
"When,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
hearing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dilemma, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
are, 1
placed,, 1
has, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
seats, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
two, 1
places, 1
at, 1
his, 1
windows, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Rospoli.", 1
The, 1
friends, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
with, 1
unutterable, 1
surprise., 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think,", 1
asked, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
we, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
accept, 1
such, 1
offers, 1
from, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
stranger?", 1
"What, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
person, 1
is, 1
this, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
asked, 1
Franz, 1
of, 1
his, 1
host., 1
"A, 1
very, 1
great, 1
nobleman,, 1
but, 1
whether, 1
Maltese, 1
or, 1
Sicilian, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
exactly, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
I, 1
know,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
noble, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Borghese, 1
and, 1
rich, 1
as, 1
a, 1
gold-mine.", 1
"It, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
speaking, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
if, 1
this, 1
person, 1
merited, 1
the, 1
high, 1
panegyrics, 1
of, 1
our, 1
landlord,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
conveyed, 1
his, 1
invitation, 1
through, 1
another, 1
channel,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
permitted, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
us, 1
in, 1
this, 1
unceremonious, 1
way., 1
He, 1
would, 1
have, 1
written--or"--, 1
At, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
some, 1
one, 1
knocked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Come, 1
in,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
A, 1
servant,, 1
wearing, 1
a, 1
livery, 1
of, 1
considerable, 1
style, 1
and, 1
richness,, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
threshold,, 1
and,, 1
placing, 1
two, 1
cards, 1
in, 1
the, 1
landlord's, 1
hands,, 1
who, 1
forthwith, 1
presented, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Please, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
these,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
Viscomte, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
servant,, 1
"begs, 1
these, 1
gentlemen's, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
upon, 1
them, 1
as, 1
their, 1
neighbor,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
honored, 1
by, 1
an, 1
intimation, 1
of, 1
what, 1
time, 1
they, 1
will, 1
please, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him.", 1
"Faith,, 1
Franz,", 1
whispered, 1
Albert,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
much, 1
to, 1
find, 1
fault, 1
with, 1
here.", 1
"Tell, 1
the, 1
count,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"that, 1
we, 1
will, 1
do, 1
ourselves, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
calling, 1
on, 1
him.", 1
The, 1
servant, 1
bowed, 1
and, 1
retired., 1
"That, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
call, 1
an, 1
elegant, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
attack,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"You, 1
were, 1
quite, 1
correct, 1
in, 1
what, 1
you, 1
said,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
unquestionably, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
first-rate, 1
breeding, 1
and, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
accept, 1
his, 1
offer?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
host., 1
"Of, 1
course, 1
we, 1
do,", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
"Still,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
own, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
be, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
give, 1
up, 1
the, 1
cart, 1
and, 1
the, 1
group, 1
of, 1
reapers--it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
produced, 1
such, 1
an, 1
effect!, 1
And, 1
were, 1
it, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Rospoli,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
recompense, 1
for, 1
the, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
our, 1
beautiful, 1
scheme,, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
but, 1
what, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
held, 1
on, 1
by, 1
my, 1
original, 1
plan., 1
What, 1
say, 1
you,, 1
Franz?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
agree, 1
with, 1
you;, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Rospoli, 1
alone, 1
decided, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
truth, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
two, 1
places, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Rospoli, 1
had, 1
recalled, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
he, 1
had, 1
overheard, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
evening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ruins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colosseum, 1
between, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
unknown, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Transteverin,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cloak, 1
had, 1
undertaken, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
the, 1
freedom, 1
of, 1
a, 1
condemned, 1
criminal;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
this, 1
muffled-up, 1
individual, 1
proved, 1
(as, 1
Franz, 1
felt, 1
sure, 1
he, 1
would), 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
the, 1
person, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Teatro, 1
Argentino,, 1
then, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
establish, 1
his, 1
identity,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
to, 1
prosecute, 1
his, 1
researches, 1
respecting, 1
him, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
facility, 1
and, 1
freedom., 1
Franz, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night, 1
in, 1
confused, 1
dreams, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
two, 1
meetings, 1
he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
had, 1
with, 1
his, 1
mysterious, 1
tormentor,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
waking, 1
speculations, 1
as, 1
to, 1
what, 1
the, 1
morrow, 1
would, 1
produce., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
must, 1
clear, 1
up, 1
every, 1
doubt;, 1
and, 1
unless, 1
his, 1
near, 1
neighbor, 1
and, 1
would-be, 1
friend,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
possessed, 1
the, 1
ring, 1
of, 1
Gyges,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
its, 1
power, 1
was, 1
able, 1
to, 1
render, 1
himself, 1
invisible,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
very, 1
certain, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
escape, 1
this, 1
time., 1
Eight, 1
o'clock, 1
found, 1
Franz, 1
up, 1
and, 1
dressed,, 1
while, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
same, 1
motives, 1
for, 1
early, 1
rising,, 1
was, 1
still, 1
soundly, 1
asleep., 1
The, 1
first, 1
act, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
to, 1
summon, 1
his, 1
landlord,, 1
who, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
his, 1
accustomed, 1
obsequiousness., 1
"Pray,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
asked, 1
Franz,, 1
"is, 1
not, 1
some, 1
execution, 1
appointed, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place, 1
to-day?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
your, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
inquiry, 1
is, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
procure, 1
a, 1
window, 1
to, 1
view, 1
it, 1
from,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
much, 1
too, 1
late.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,", 1
answered, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
no, 1
such, 1
intention;, 1
and, 1
even, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
spectacle,, 1
I, 1
might, 1
have, 1
done, 1
so, 1
from, 1
Monte, 1
Pincio--could, 1
I, 1
not?", 1
"Ah!", 1
exclaimed, 1
mine, 1
host,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
it, 1
likely, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
would, 1
have, 1
chosen, 1
to, 1
mingle, 1
with, 1
such, 1
a, 1
rabble, 1
as, 1
are, 1
always, 1
collected, 1
on, 1
that, 1
hill,, 1
which,, 1
indeed,, 1
they, 1
consider, 1
as, 1
exclusively, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
themselves.", 1
"Very, 1
possibly, 1
I, 1
may, 1
not, 1
go,", 1
answered, 1
Franz;, 1
"but, 1
in, 1
case, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
disposed,, 1
give, 1
me, 1
some, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
to-day's, 1
executions.", 1
"What, 1
particulars, 1
would, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
like, 1
to, 1
hear?", 1
"Why,, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
persons, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
suffer,, 1
their, 1
names,, 1
and, 1
description, 1
of, 1
the, 1
death, 1
they, 1
are, 1
to, 1
die.", 1
"That, 1
happens, 1
just, 1
lucky,, 1
your, 1
excellency!, 1
Only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
ago, 1
they, 1
brought, 1
me, 1
the, 1
tavolettas.", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
they?", 1
"Sort, 1
of, 1
wooden, 1
tablets, 1
hung, 1
up, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corners, 1
of, 1
streets, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
before, 1
an, 1
execution,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
is, 1
pasted, 1
up, 1
a, 1
paper, 1
containing, 1
the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
the, 1
condemned, 1
persons,, 1
their, 1
crimes,, 1
and, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
punishment., 1
The, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
so, 1
publicly, 1
announcing, 1
all, 1
this, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
all, 1
good, 1
and, 1
faithful, 1
Catholics, 1
may, 1
offer, 1
up, 1
their, 1
prayers, 1
for, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
culprits,, 1
and,, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
beseech, 1
of, 1
heaven, 1
to, 1
grant, 1
them, 1
a, 1
sincere, 1
repentance.", 1
"And, 1
these, 1
tablets, 1
are, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
add, 1
your, 1
prayers, 1
to, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
faithful,, 1
are, 1
they?", 1
asked, 1
Franz, 1
somewhat, 1
incredulously., 1
"Oh,, 1
dear,, 1
no,, 1
your, 1
excellency!, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
time, 1
for, 1
anybody's, 1
affairs, 1
but, 1
my, 1
own, 1
and, 1
those, 1
of, 1
my, 1
honorable, 1
guests;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
make, 1
an, 1
agreement, 1
with, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
pastes, 1
up, 1
the, 1
papers,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
brings, 1
them, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
the, 1
playbills,, 1
that, 1
in, 1
case, 1
any, 1
person, 1
staying, 1
at, 1
my, 1
hotel, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
an, 1
execution,, 1
he, 1
may, 1
obtain, 1
every, 1
requisite, 1
information, 1
concerning, 1
the, 1
time, 1
and, 1
place, 1

"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
a, 1
most, 1
delicate, 1
attention, 1
on, 1
your, 1
part,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Why,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
landlord,, 1
chuckling, 1
and, 1
rubbing, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
infinite, 1
complacency,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
may, 1
take, 1
upon, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
say, 1
I, 1
neglect, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
deserve, 1
the, 1
support, 1
and, 1
patronage, 1
of, 1
the, 1
noble, 1
visitors, 1
to, 1
this, 1
poor, 1
hotel.", 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
plainly, 1
enough,, 1
my, 1
most, 1
excellent, 1
host,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
may, 1
rely, 1
upon, 1
me, 1
to, 1
proclaim, 1
so, 1
striking, 1
a, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
your, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
your, 1
guests, 1
wherever, 1
I, 1
go., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
oblige, 1
me, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
tavolettas.", 1
"Nothing, 1
can, 1
be, 1
easier, 1
than, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
your, 1
excellency's, 1
wish,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
landlord,, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chamber;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
caused, 1
one, 1
to, 1
be, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1

by, 1
your, 1

Then,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
tablet, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
he, 1
handed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
read, 1
as, 1
follows:--, 1

mazzuola,, 1
the, 1
second, 1
culprit, 1
beheaded., 1
The, 1
prayers, 1
of, 1
all, 1
good, 1
Christians, 1
are, 1
entreated, 1
for, 1
these, 1
unfortunate, 1
men,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
may, 1
please, 1
God, 1
to, 1
awaken, 1
them, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
their, 1
guilt,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
grant, 1
them, 1
a, 1
hearty, 1
and, 1
sincere, 1
repentance, 1
for, 1
their, 1
crimes.'", 1
This, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1
what, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
before, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ruins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colosseum., 1
No, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
programme, 1
differed,--the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
the, 1
condemned, 1
persons,, 1
their, 1
crimes,, 1
and, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
punishment,, 1
all, 1
agreed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
previous, 1
information., 1
In, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
therefore,, 1
the, 1
Transteverin, 1
was, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
man, 1
shrouded, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
the, 1
same, 1
he, 1
had, 1
known, 1
as, 1
"Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor,", 1
but, 1
who,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
was, 1
still, 1
pursuing, 1
his, 1
philanthropic, 1
expedition, 1
in, 1
Rome,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
done, 1
at, 1
Porto-Vecchio, 1
and, 1
Tunis., 1
Time, 1
was, 1
getting, 1
on,, 1
however,, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
deemed, 1
it, 1
advisable, 1
to, 1
awaken, 1
Albert;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
proceed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
chamber,, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
perfect, 1
costume, 1
for, 1
the, 1
day., 1
The, 1
anticipated, 1
delights, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
had, 1
so, 1
run, 1
in, 1
his, 1
head, 1
as, 1
to, 1
make, 1
him, 1
leave, 1
his, 1
pillow, 1
long, 1
before, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
hour., 1
"Now,, 1
my, 1
excellent, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
addressing, 1
his, 1
landlord,, 1
"since, 1
we, 1
are, 1
both, 1
ready,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
we, 1
may, 1
proceed, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"Most, 1
assuredly,", 1
replied, 1
he., 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
always, 1
an, 1
early, 1
riser;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
can, 1
answer, 1
for, 1
his, 1
having, 1
been, 1
up, 1
these, 1
two, 1
hours.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
really, 1
consider, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
intruding, 1
if, 1
we, 1
pay, 1
our, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
him, 1
directly?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
sure., 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
all, 1
the, 1
blame, 1
on, 1
myself, 1
if, 1
you, 1
find, 1
I, 1
have, 1
led, 1
you, 1
into, 1
an, 1
error.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
so,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
ready,, 1
Albert?", 1
"Perfectly.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
and, 1
return, 1
our, 1
best, 1
thanks, 1
for, 1
his, 1
courtesy.", 1
"Yes,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
The, 1
landlord, 1
preceded, 1
the, 1
friends, 1
across, 1
the, 1
landing,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
all, 1
that, 1
separated, 1
them, 1
from, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
rang, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
and,, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
door, 1
being, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
a, 1
servant,, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
signori, 1
Francesi.", 1
The, 1
domestic, 1
bowed, 1
respectfully,, 1
and, 1
invited, 1
them, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
They, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
two, 1
rooms,, 1
furnished, 1
in, 1
a, 1
luxurious, 1
manner, 1
they, 1
had, 1
not, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
see, 1
under, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
shown, 1
into, 1
an, 1
elegantly, 1
fitted-up, 1
drawing-room., 1
The, 1
richest, 1
Turkey, 1
carpets, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
softest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
inviting, 1
couches,, 1
easy-chairs,, 1
and, 1
sofas,, 1
offered, 1
their, 1
high-piled, 1
and, 1
yielding, 1
cushions, 1
to, 1
such, 1
as, 1
desired, 1
repose, 1
or, 1
refreshment., 1
Splendid, 1
paintings, 1
by, 1
the, 1
first, 1
masters, 1
were, 1
ranged, 1
against, 1
the, 1
walls,, 1
intermingled, 1
with, 1
magnificent, 1
trophies, 1
of, 1
war,, 1
while, 1
heavy, 1
curtains, 1
of, 1
costly, 1
tapestry, 1
were, 1
suspended, 1
before, 1
the, 1
different, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"If, 1
your, 1
excellencies, 1
will, 1
please, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seated,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
let, 1
the, 1
count, 1
know, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
here.", 1
And, 1
with, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
disappeared, 1
behind, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tapestried, 1
portieres., 1
As, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
guzla, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
ears, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
but, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
lost,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
closing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door, 1
merely, 1
allowed, 1
one, 1
rich, 1
swell, 1
of, 1
harmony, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
inquiringly, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
then, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gorgeous, 1
furnishings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
Everything, 1
seemed, 1
more, 1
magnificent, 1
at, 1
a, 1
second, 1
view, 1
than, 1
it, 1
had, 1
done, 1
at, 1
their, 1
first, 1
rapid, 1
survey., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
"what, 1
think, 1
you, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
"Why,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1
it, 1
strikes, 1
me, 1
that, 1
our, 1
elegant, 1
and, 1
attentive, 1
neighbor, 1
must, 1
either, 1
be, 1
some, 1
successful, 1
stock-jobber, 1
who, 1
has, 1
speculated, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fall, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
funds,, 1
or, 1
some, 1
prince, 1
travelling, 1
incog.", 1
"Hush,, 1
hush!", 1
replied, 1
Franz;, 1
"we, 1
shall, 1
ascertain, 1
who, 1
and, 1
what, 1
he, 1
is--he, 1
comes!", 1
As, 1
Franz, 1
spoke,, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
door, 1
turning, 1
on, 1
its, 1
hinges,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
tapestry, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
aside,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
all, 1
these, 1
riches, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men., 1
Albert, 1
instantly, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
Franz, 1
remained,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner,, 1
spellbound, 1
on, 1
his, 1
chair;, 1
for, 1
in, 1
the, 1
person, 1
of, 1
him, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
entered, 1
he, 1
recognized, 1
not, 1
only, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
visitant, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
occupant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Teatro, 1
Argentino,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
his, 1
extraordinary, 1
host, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Chapter, 1
35., 1
La, 1
Mazzolata., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
as, 1
he, 1
entered,, 1
"I, 1
pray, 1
you, 1
excuse, 1
me, 1
for, 1
suffering, 1
my, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
be, 1
anticipated;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
disturb, 1
you, 1
by, 1
presenting, 1
myself, 1
earlier, 1
at, 1
your, 1
apartments;, 1
besides,, 1
you, 1
sent, 1
me, 1
word, 1
that, 1
you, 1
would, 1
come, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
held, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
your, 1
disposal.", 1
"Franz, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
times,, 1
count,", 1
returned, 1
Albert;, 1
"you, 1
extricated, 1
us, 1
from, 1
a, 1
great, 1
dilemma,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
inventing, 1
a, 1
very, 1
fantastic, 1
vehicle, 1
when, 1
your, 1
friendly, 1
invitation, 1
reached, 1
us.", 1
"Indeed,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
motioning, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
fault, 1
of, 1
that, 1
blockhead, 1
Pastrini,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
sooner, 1
assist, 1
you, 1
in, 1
your, 1
distress., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
mention, 1
a, 1
syllable, 1
of, 1
your, 1
embarrassment, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
that,, 1
alone, 1
and, 1
isolated, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
I, 1
seek, 1
every, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
making, 1
the, 1
acquaintance, 1
of, 1
my, 1
neighbors., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
I, 1
learned, 1
I, 1
could, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
assist, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
most, 1
eagerly, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
offering, 1
my, 1
services.", 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
bowed., 1
Franz, 1
had,, 1
as, 1
yet,, 1
found, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
say;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
no, 1
determination,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
nothing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
manner, 1
manifested, 1
the, 1
wish, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
recognize, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
to, 1
make, 1
any, 1
allusion, 1
to, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
or, 1
wait, 1
until, 1
he, 1
had, 1
more, 1
proof;, 1
besides,, 1
although, 1
sure, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
the, 1
box, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
equally, 1
positive, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
man, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Colosseum., 1
He, 1
resolved,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
let, 1
things, 1
take, 1
their, 1
course, 1
without, 1
making, 1
any, 1
direct, 1
overture, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Moreover,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
this, 1
advantage,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
secret,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
no, 1
hold, 1
on, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
conceal., 1
However,, 1
he, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
to, 1
a, 1
subject, 1
which, 1
might, 1
possibly, 1
clear, 1
up, 1
his, 1
doubts., 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
offered, 1
us, 1
places, 1
in, 1
your, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
your, 1
windows, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace., 1
Can, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
where, 1
we, 1
can, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo?", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
negligently,, 1
looking, 1
attentively, 1
at, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"is, 1
there, 1
not, 1
something, 1
like, 1
an, 1
execution, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo?", 1
"Yes,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
finding, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point, 1
he, 1
wished., 1
"Stay,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
told, 1
my, 1
steward, 1
yesterday, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
to, 1
this;, 1
perhaps, 1
I, 1
can, 1
render, 1
you, 1
this, 1
slight, 1
service, 1
also.", 1
He, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
thrice., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
occupy, 1
yourself,", 1

he, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
"with, 1
the, 1

I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
waste, 1
a, 1
minute, 1

a, 1
word., 1
Here, 1
he, 1
is.", 1
A, 1
man, 1
of, 1
about, 1
forty-five, 1
or, 1
fifty, 1
entered,, 1
exactly, 1
resembling, 1
the, 1
smuggler, 1
who, 1
had, 1
introduced, 1
Franz, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cavern;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
he, 1
had, 1
his, 1
orders., 1
"Monsieur, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
procured, 1
me, 1
windows, 1

"Yes,, 1

the, 1
steward;, 1

"Did, 1
I, 1
not, 1

you, 1
I, 1

frowning., 1
"And, 1

one,, 1

"That, 1

The, 1
steward, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Ah,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"be, 1
good, 1
enough, 1

of, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
saying--"Al, 1
suo, 1
commodo!", 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
breakfast-room., 1
During, 1
the, 1
meal,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
excellent,, 1
and, 1
admirably, 1
served,, 1
Franz, 1
looked, 1
repeatedly, 1
at, 1
Albert,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
the, 1
impressions, 1
which, 1
he, 1
doubted, 1
not, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
on, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
their, 1
entertainer;, 1
but, 1
whether, 1
with, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
carelessness, 1
he, 1
had, 1
paid, 1
but, 1
little, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
explanation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
regard, 1
to, 1
duelling, 1
had, 1
satisfied, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
events, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
knew, 1
of, 1
had, 1
had, 1
their, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
him, 1
alone,, 1
he, 1
remarked, 1
that, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
did, 1
not, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
least, 1
regard, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary, 1
ate, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
months, 1
had, 1
been, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
partake, 1
of, 1
Italian, 1
cookery--that, 1
is,, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
he, 1
just, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
dishes;, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
the, 1
duties, 1
of, 1
a, 1
host, 1
by, 1
sitting, 1
down, 1
with, 1
his, 1
guests,, 1
and, 1
awaited, 1
their, 1
departure, 1
to, 1
be, 1
served, 1
with, 1
some, 1
strange, 1
or, 1
more, 1
delicate, 1
food., 1
This, 1
brought, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
himself,, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
inspired, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
firm, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
box, 1
was, 1
a, 1
vampire., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
breakfast, 1
Franz, 1
took, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing?", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
excuse, 1
us,, 1
count,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"but, 1
we, 1
have, 1
still, 1
much, 1
to, 1
do.", 1
"What, 1
may, 1
that, 1
be?", 1
"We, 1
have, 1
no, 1
masks,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
absolutely, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
them.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
concern, 1
yourself, 1
about, 1
that;, 1
we, 1
have,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
a, 1
private, 1
room, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
have, 1
whatever, 1
costumes, 1
you, 1
choose, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
can, 1
dress, 1
there.", 1
"After, 1
the, 1
execution?", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Before, 1
or, 1
after,, 1
whichever, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
"Opposite, 1
the, 1
scaffold?", 1
"The, 1
scaffold, 1
forms, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fete.", 1
"Count,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
reflected, 1
on, 1
the, 1
matter,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
for, 1
your, 1
courtesy,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
content, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
accepting, 1
a, 1
place, 1
in, 1
your, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
at, 1
your, 1
window, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
my, 1
place, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
warn, 1
you,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
very, 1
curious, 1
sight,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
describe, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
recital, 1
from, 1
your, 1
lips, 1
will, 1
make, 1
as, 1
great, 1
an, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
me, 1
as, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
witnessed, 1
it., 1
I, 1
have, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once, 1
intended, 1
witnessing, 1
an, 1
execution,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
my, 1
mind;, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
Albert?", 1
"I,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
viscount,--"I, 1
saw, 1
Castaing, 1
executed,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
intoxicated, 1
that, 1
day,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
had, 1
quitted, 1
college, 1
the, 1
same, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
night, 1
at, 1
a, 1
tavern.", 1
"Besides,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
because, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
an, 1
execution, 1
at, 1
Paris,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
not, 1
see, 1
one, 1
anywhere, 1
else;, 1
when, 1
you, 1
travel,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
see, 1
everything., 1
Think, 1
what, 1
a, 1
figure, 1
you, 1
will, 1
make, 1
when, 1
you, 1
are, 1
asked,, 1
'How, 1
do, 1
they, 1
execute, 1
at, 1
Rome?', 1
and, 1
you, 1
reply,, 1
'I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know'!, 1
And,, 1
besides,, 1
they, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
culprit, 1
is, 1
an, 1
infamous, 1
scoundrel,, 1
who, 1
killed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
log, 1
of, 1
wood, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
canon, 1
who, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
up, 1
like, 1
his, 1
own, 1
son., 1
Diable,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
churchman, 1
is, 1
killed,, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
with, 1
a, 1
different, 1
weapon, 1
than, 1
a, 1
log,, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
he, 1
has, 1
behaved, 1
like, 1
a, 1
father., 1
If, 1
you, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Spain,, 1
would, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
the, 1
bull-fight?, 1
Well,, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bull-fight, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
see?, 1
Recollect, 1
the, 1
ancient, 1
Romans, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Circus,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sports, 1
where, 1
they, 1
killed, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
lions, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
men., 1
Think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
eighty, 1
thousand, 1
applauding, 1
spectators,, 1
the, 1
sage, 1
matrons, 1
who, 1
took, 1
their, 1
daughters,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
Vestals, 1
who, 1
made, 1
with, 1
the, 1
thumb, 1
of, 1
their, 1
white, 1
hands, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
said,, 1
'Come,, 1
despatch, 1
the, 1
dying.'", 1
"Shall, 1
you, 1
go,, 1
then,, 1
Albert?", 1
asked, 1
Franz., 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
yes;, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
hesitated,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
eloquence, 1
decides, 1
me.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
go,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"since, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
it;, 1

on, 1
our, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1

a, 1
carriage,, 1
no.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
on, 1
foot,, 1
then.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
important, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
go, 1
that, 1
way?", 1
"Yes,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
something, 1

"Well,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
go, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Corso., 1
We, 1
will, 1
send, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
us, 1
on, 1
the, 1

shall, 1
be, 1
glad, 1
to, 1

myself,, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Corso,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
some, 1
orders, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
have, 1
been, 1
executed.", 1
"Excellency,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
servant,, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
"a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dress, 1
of, 1
a, 1
penitent, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
who, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
gentlemen;, 1
will, 1
you, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
salon?, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
good, 1
cigars, 1
on, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
table., 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
with, 1
you, 1
directly.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
men, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
into, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
again, 1
apologizing,, 1
left, 1
by, 1
another, 1
door., 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
smoker,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
considered, 1
it, 1
no, 1
small, 1
sacrifice, 1
to, 1
be, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cigars, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1
Paris,, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
perceiving, 1
some, 1
veritable, 1
puros., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
Franz,, 1
"what, 1
think, 1
you, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
evidently, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
such, 1
a, 1
question, 1
from, 1
his, 1
companion;, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
fellow,, 1
who, 1
does, 1
the, 1
honors, 1
of, 1
his, 1
table, 1
admirably;, 1
who, 1
has, 1
travelled, 1
much,, 1
read, 1
much,, 1
is,, 1
like, 1
Brutus,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Stoic, 1
school,, 1
and, 1
moreover,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
sending, 1
a, 1
volume, 1
of, 1
smoke, 1
up, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
ceiling,, 1
"that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
excellent, 1
cigars.", 1
Such, 1
was, 1
Albert's, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
Franz, 1
well, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
professed, 1
never, 1
to, 1
form, 1
an, 1
opinion, 1
except, 1
upon, 1
long, 1
reflection,, 1
he, 1
made, 1
no, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
change, 1
it., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
observe, 1
one, 1
very, 1
singular, 1
thing?", 1
"What?", 1
"How, 1
attentively, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
you.", 1
"At, 1
me?", 1
"Yes."--Albert, 1
reflected., 1
"Ah,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
sighing,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
very, 1
surprising;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
year, 1
absent, 1
from, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
clothes, 1
are, 1
of, 1
a, 1
most, 1
antiquated, 1
cut;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
takes, 1
me, 1
for, 1
a, 1
provincial., 1
The, 1
first, 1
opportunity, 1
you, 1
have,, 1
undeceive, 1
him,, 1
I, 1
beg,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
I, 1
am, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kind.", 1
Franz, 1
smiled;, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
after, 1
the, 1
count, 1
entered., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
now, 1
quite, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"The, 1
carriage, 1
is, 1
going, 1
one, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1

we, 1
will, 1
go, 1
another;, 1
and,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Corso., 1
Take, 1
some, 1
more, 1
of, 1
these, 1
cigars,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"With, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart,", 1
returned, 1
Albert;, 1
"Italian, 1
cigars, 1
are, 1
horrible., 1
When, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
return, 1
all, 1
this.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
refuse;, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
going, 1
there, 1
soon,, 1
and, 1
since, 1
you, 1
allow, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
pay, 1
you, 1
a, 1
visit., 1
Come,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
not, 1
any, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
half-past, 1
twelve--let, 1
us, 1
set, 1
off.", 1
All, 1
three, 1
descended;, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
received, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
orders,, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
del, 1
Babuino., 1
While, 1
the, 1
three, 1
gentlemen, 1
walked, 1
along, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
de, 1
Spagni, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Frattina,, 1
which, 1
led, 1
directly, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Fiano, 1
and, 1
Rospoli, 1
palaces,, 1
Franz's, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
that, 1
last, 1
palace,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
forgotten, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
agreed, 1
upon, 1
between, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Transtevere, 1
peasant., 1
"Which, 1
are, 1
your, 1
windows?", 1
asked, 1
he, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
indifference, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could, 1
assume., 1
"The, 1
three, 1
last,", 1
returned, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
negligence, 1
evidently, 1
unaffected,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
imagine, 1
with, 1
what, 1
intention, 1
the, 1
question, 1
was, 1
put., 1
Franz, 1
glanced, 1
rapidly, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
three, 1
windows., 1
The, 1
side, 1
windows, 1
were, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
yellow, 1
damask,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
one, 1
with, 1
white, 1
damask, 1
and, 1
a, 1
red, 1
cross., 1
The, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Transteverin,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
could, 1
now, 1
be, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
count., 1
The, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
were, 1
still, 1
untenanted., 1
Preparations, 1
were, 1
making, 1
on, 1
every, 1
side;, 1
chairs, 1
were, 1
placed,, 1
scaffolds, 1
were, 1
raised,, 1
and, 1
windows, 1
were, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
flags., 1
The, 1
masks, 1
could, 1
not, 1
appear;, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
could, 1
not, 1
move, 1
about;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
masks, 1
were, 1
visible, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
the, 1
carriages,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
doors., 1
Franz,, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
descend, 1
the, 1
Corso., 1
As, 1
they, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
became, 1
more, 1
dense,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
the, 1
heads, 1
of, 1
the, 1
multitude, 1
two, 1
objects, 1
were, 1
visible:, 1
the, 1
obelisk,, 1
surmounted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
cross,, 1
which, 1
marks, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
square,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
obelisk,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
point, 1
where, 1
the, 1
three, 1
streets,, 1
del, 1
Babuino,, 1
del, 1
Corso,, 1
and, 1
di, 1
Ripetta,, 1
meet,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
uprights, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scaffold,, 1
between, 1
which, 1
glittered, 1
the, 1
curved, 1
knife, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mandaia., 1
At, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street, 1
they, 1
met, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
steward,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
awaiting, 1
his, 1
master., 1
The, 1
window,, 1
let, 1
at, 1
an, 1
exorbitant, 1
price,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
doubtless, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
from, 1
his, 1
guests,, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
great, 1
palace,, 1
situated, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
del, 1
Babuino, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Monte, 1
Pincio., 1
It, 1
consisted,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
dressing-room,, 1
opening, 1
into, 1
a, 1
bedroom,, 1
and,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
communication, 1
was, 1
shut,, 1
the, 1
inmates, 1
were, 1
quite, 1
alone., 1
On, 1
chairs, 1
were, 1
laid, 1
elegant, 1
masquerade, 1
costumes, 1
of, 1
blue, 1
and, 1
white, 1
satin., 1
"As, 1
you, 1
left, 1
the, 1
choice, 1
of, 1
your, 1
costumes, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
had, 1
these, 1
brought,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
most, 1
worn, 1
this, 1
year;, 1
and, 1
they, 1
are, 1
most, 1
suitable,, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
the, 1
confetti, 1
(sweetmeats),, 1
as, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
show, 1
the, 1
flour.", 1
Franz, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
but, 1
imperfectly,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
perhaps, 1
did, 1
not, 1
fully, 1
appreciate, 1
this, 1
new, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
their, 1
wishes;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
absorbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
spectacle, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo, 1
presented,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
instrument, 1
that, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
a, 1
guillotine,--we, 1
say, 1
guillotine,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
mandaia, 1
is, 1
formed, 1
on, 1
almost, 1
the, 1
same, 1
model, 1
as, 1
the, 1
French, 1
instrument., 1
[*], 1
The, 1
knife,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
shaped, 1
like, 1
a, 1
crescent,, 1
that, 1
cuts, 1
with, 1
the, 1
convex, 1
side,, 1
falls, 1
from, 1
a, 1
less, 1
height,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
the, 1
difference., 1
Two, 1
men,, 1
seated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
movable, 1
plank, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
is, 1
laid,, 1
were, 1
eating, 1
their, 1
breakfasts,, 1
while, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
the, 1
criminal., 1
Their, 1
repast, 1
consisted, 1
apparently, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
sausages., 1
One, 1
of, 1
them, 1
lifted, 1
the, 1
plank,, 1
took, 1
out, 1
a, 1
flask, 1
of, 1
wine,, 1
drank, 1
some,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
passed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
These, 1
two, 1
men, 1
were, 1
the, 1
executioner's, 1
assistants., 1
At, 1
this, 1
sight, 1
Franz, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
start, 1
forth, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
The, 1
prisoners,, 1
transported, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Carcere, 1
Nuovo, 1
to, 1
the, 1
little, 1
church, 1
of, 1
Santa, 1
Maria, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
each, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
two, 1
priests,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
chapel, 1
closed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
grating,, 1
before, 1
which, 1
were, 1
two, 1
sentinels,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
relieved, 1
at, 1
intervals., 1
A, 1
double, 1
line, 1
of, 1
carbineers,, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
each, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
church,, 1
reached, 1
to, 1
the, 1
scaffold,, 1
and, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
circle, 1
around, 1
it,, 1
leaving, 1
a, 1
path, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
feet, 1
wide,, 1
and, 1
around, 1
the, 1
guillotine, 1
a, 1
space, 1
of, 1
nearly, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
feet., 1
All, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
square, 1
was, 1
paved, 1
with, 1
heads., 1
Many, 1
women, 1
held, 1
their, 1
infants, 1
on, 1
their, 1
shoulders,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
the, 1
children, 1
had, 1
the, 1
best, 1
view., 1
The, 1
Monte, 1
Pincio, 1
seemed, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
amphitheatre, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
spectators;, 1
the, 1
balconies, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
churches, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
del, 1
Babuino, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
di, 1
Ripetta, 1
were, 1
crammed;, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
even, 1
seemed, 1
a, 1
parti-colored, 1
sea,, 1
that, 1
was, 1
impelled, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
portico;, 1
every, 1
niche, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
held, 1
its, 1
living, 1
statue., 1
What, 1
the, 1
count, 1
said, 1
was, 1
true--the, 1
most, 1
curious, 1
spectacle, 1
in, 1
life, 1
is, 1
that, 1
of, 1
death., 1
And, 1
yet,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
and, 1
the, 1
solemnity, 1
demanded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
occasion,, 1
laughter, 1
and, 1
jests, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
the, 1
crowd., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
the, 1
execution, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
people,, 1
only, 1
the, 1
commencement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival., 1
Suddenly, 1
the, 1
tumult, 1
ceased,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
by, 1
magic,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
church, 1
opened., 1
A, 1
brotherhood, 1
of, 1
penitents,, 1
clothed, 1
from, 1
head, 1
to, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
robes, 1
of, 1
gray, 1
sackcloth,, 1
with, 1
holes, 1
for, 1
the, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
their, 1
hands, 1
lighted, 1
tapers,, 1
appeared, 1
first;, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
marched, 1
at, 1
the, 1
head., 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
penitents, 1
came, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
vast, 1
stature, 1
and, 1
proportions., 1
He, 1
was, 1
naked,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
cloth, 1
drawers, 1
at, 1
the, 1
left, 1
side, 1
of, 1
which, 1
hung, 1
a, 1
large, 1
knife, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sheath,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
bore, 1
on, 1
his, 1
right, 1
shoulder, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
iron, 1
sledge-hammer., 1
This, 1
man, 1
was, 1
the, 1
executioner., 1
He, 1
had,, 1
moreover,, 1
sandals, 1
bound, 1
on, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
by, 1
cords., 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
executioner, 1
came,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
order, 1
in, 1
which, 1
they, 1
were, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
first, 1
Peppino, 1
and, 1
then, 1
Andrea., 1
Each, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
two, 1
priests., 1
Neither, 1
had, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
bandaged., 1
Peppino, 1
walked, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
step,, 1
doubtless, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
what, 1
awaited, 1
him., 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
two, 1
priests., 1
Each, 1
of, 1
them,, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time,, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
crucifix, 1
a, 1
confessor, 1
held, 1
out, 1
to, 1
them., 1
At, 1
this, 1
sight, 1
alone, 1
Franz, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
tremble, 1
under, 1
him., 1
He, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Albert--he, 1
was, 1
as, 1
white, 1
as, 1
his, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
mechanically, 1
cast, 1
away, 1
his, 1
cigar,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
half, 1
smoked, 1
it., 1
The, 1
count, 1
alone, 1
seemed, 1
unmoved--nay,, 1
more,, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
color, 1
seemed, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
rise, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
cheeks., 1
His, 1
nostrils, 1
dilated, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
wild, 1
beast, 1
that, 1
scents, 1
its, 1
prey,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
half, 1
opened,, 1
disclosed, 1
his, 1
white, 1
teeth,, 1
small, 1
and, 1
sharp, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
jackal., 1
And, 1
yet, 1
his, 1
features, 1
wore, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
smiling, 1
tenderness,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
never, 1
before, 1
witnessed, 1
in, 1
them;, 1
his, 1
black, 1
eyes, 1
especially, 1
were, 1
full, 1
of, 1
kindness, 1
and, 1
pity., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
culprits, 1
advanced,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
they, 1
approached, 1
their, 1
faces, 1
became, 1
visible., 1
Peppino, 1
was, 1
a, 1
handsome, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty,, 1
bronzed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sun;, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
his, 1
head, 1
erect,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
watch, 1
to, 1
see, 1
on, 1
which, 1
side, 1
his, 1
liberator, 1
would, 1
appear., 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
short, 1
and, 1
fat;, 1
his, 1
visage,, 1
marked, 1
with, 1
brutal, 1
cruelty,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
indicate, 1
age;, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
thirty., 1
In, 1
prison, 1
he, 1
had, 1
suffered, 1
his, 1
beard, 1
to, 1
grow;, 1
his, 1
head, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
bent, 1
beneath, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
movements, 1
were, 1
apparently, 1
automatic, 1
and, 1
unconscious., 1
*, 1
Dr., 1
Guillotin, 1
got, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
his, 1
famous, 1
machine, 1
from, 1
witnessing, 1
an, 1
execution, 1
in, 1
Italy., 1
"I, 1
thought,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
there, 1
would, 1
be, 1
but, 1
one, 1
execution.", 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
true,", 1
replied, 1
he, 1
coldly., 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
here, 1
are, 1
two, 1
culprits.", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
only, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
die;, 1
the, 1
other, 1
has, 1
many, 1
years, 1
to, 1
live.", 1
"If, 1
the, 1
pardon, 1
is, 1
to, 1
come,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose.", 1
"And, 1
see,, 1
here, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
Peppino, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mandaia,, 1
a, 1
priest, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
some, 1
haste,, 1
forced, 1
his, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
soldiers,, 1
and,, 1
advancing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brotherhood,, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
a, 1
folded, 1
paper., 1
The, 1
piercing, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Peppino, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
all., 1
The, 1
chief, 1
took, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
unfolded, 1
it,, 1
and,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
"Heaven, 1
be, 1
praised,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
holiness, 1
also,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
voice;, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoners!", 1
"A, 1
pardon!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
people, 1
with, 1
one, 1
voice--"a, 1
pardon!", 1
At, 1
this, 1
cry, 1
Andrea, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Pardon, 1
for, 1
whom?", 1
cried, 1
he., 1
Peppino, 1
remained, 1
breathless., 1
"A, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
Peppino,, 1
called, 1
Rocca, 1
Priori,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
friar., 1
And, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
to, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
commanding, 1
the, 1
carbineers,, 1
who, 1
read, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
it, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"For, 1
Peppino!", 1
cried, 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
roused, 1
from, 1
the, 1
torpor, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
plunged., 1
"Why, 1
for, 1
him, 1
and, 1
not, 1
for, 1
me?, 1
We, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
die, 1
together., 1
I, 1
was, 1
promised, 1
he, 1
should, 1
die, 1
with, 1
me., 1
You, 1
have, 1
no, 1
right, 1
to, 1
put, 1
me, 1
to, 1
death, 1
alone., 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
die, 1
alone--I, 1
will, 1
not!", 1
And, 1
he, 1
broke, 1
from, 1
the, 1
priests, 1
struggling, 1
and, 1
raving, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wild, 1
beast,, 1
and, 1
striving, 1
desperately, 1
to, 1
break, 1
the, 1
cords, 1
that, 1
bound, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
The, 1
executioner, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
two, 1
assistants, 1
leaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
scaffold, 1
and, 1
seized, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
going, 1
on?", 1
asked, 1
Franz, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
for,, 1
as, 1
all, 1
the, 1
talk, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
dialect,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
perfectly, 1
understood, 1
it., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see?", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"that, 1
this, 1
human, 1
creature, 1
who, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
die, 1
is, 1
furious, 1
that, 1
his, 1
fellow-sufferer, 1
does, 1
not, 1
perish, 1
with, 1
him?, 1
and,, 1
were, 1
he, 1
able,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
tear, 1
him, 1
to, 1
pieces, 1
with, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
and, 1
nails, 1
than, 1

him, 1

himself, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
deprived, 1
of., 1
Oh,, 1
man,, 1
man--race, 1
of, 1
crocodiles,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
clinched, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
"how, 1
well, 1
do, 1
I, 1
recognize, 1
you, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
at, 1
all, 1
times, 1
you, 1
are, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
yourselves!", 1
Meanwhile, 1
Andrea, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
executioners, 1
were, 1
struggling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
exclaiming,, 1
"He, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
die!--he, 1
shall, 1
die!--I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
die, 1
alone!", 1
"Look,, 1
look,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
seizing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men's, 1
hands--"look,, 1
for, 1
on, 1
my, 1
soul, 1
it, 1
is, 1
curious., 1
Here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
resigned, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
his, 1
fate,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
scaffold, 1
to, 1
die--like, 1
a, 1
coward,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
die, 1
without, 1
resistance., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
strength?--do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
consoled, 1
him?, 1
It, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
another, 1
partook, 1
of, 1
his, 1
punishment--that, 1
another, 1
partook, 1
of, 1
his, 1
anguish--that, 1
another, 1
was, 1
to, 1
die, 1
before, 1
him., 1
Lead, 1
two, 1
sheep, 1
to, 1
the, 1
butcher's,, 1
two, 1
oxen, 1
to, 1
the, 1
slaughterhouse,, 1

make, 1
one, 1
of, 1
them, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
will, 1
not, 1
die;, 1
the, 1
sheep, 1
will, 1
bleat, 1
for, 1
pleasure,, 1
the, 1
ox, 1
will, 1
bellow, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
But, 1
man--man,, 1
whom, 1
God, 1
created, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
image--man,, 1
upon, 1
whom, 1
God, 1
has, 1
laid, 1
his, 1
first,, 1
his, 1
sole, 1
commandment,, 1
to, 1
love, 1
his, 1
neighbor--man,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
God, 1
has, 1
given, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
to, 1
express, 1
his, 1

is, 1
his, 1
first, 1
cry, 1
when, 1
he, 1
hears, 1
his, 1
fellow-man, 1
is, 1
saved?, 1
A, 1
blasphemy., 1
Honor, 1
to, 1
man,, 1
this, 1
masterpiece, 1
of, 1
nature,, 1
this, 1
king, 1
of, 1
the, 1
creation!", 1
And, 1
the, 1
count, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
laugh;, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
laugh,, 1
that, 1
showed, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
horribly, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
laugh., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
still, 1
continued,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
dreadful, 1
to, 1
witness., 1
The, 1
people, 1
all, 1
took, 1
part, 1
against, 1
Andrea,, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
thousand, 1
voices, 1
cried,, 1
"Put, 1
him, 1
to, 1
death!, 1
put, 1
him, 1
to, 1
death!", 1
Franz, 1
sprang, 1
back,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
him, 1
before, 1
the, 1
window., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
pity, 1
him?, 1
If, 1
you, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
'Mad, 1
dog!', 1
you, 1
would, 1
take, 1
your, 1
gun--you, 1
would, 1
unhesitatingly, 1
shoot, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
beast,, 1
who,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
was, 1
only, 1
guilty, 1
of, 1
having, 1
been, 1
bitten, 1
by, 1
another, 1
dog., 1
And, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
pity, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
bitten, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
race,, 1
has, 1
yet, 1
murdered, 1
his, 1
benefactor;, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
now, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
any, 1
one,, 1

his, 1
hands, 1
are, 1
bound,, 1

his, 1
companion, 1
in, 1
captivity, 1
perish., 1
No,, 1
no--look,, 1
look!", 1
The, 1
command, 1
was, 1
needless., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
fascinated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
horrible, 1
spectacle., 1
The, 1
two, 1
assistants, 1
had, 1
borne, 1
Andrea, 1
to, 1
the, 1
scaffold,, 1
and, 1
there,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
struggles,, 1
his, 1
bites,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
cries,, 1
had, 1
forced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
his, 1
knees., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
executioner, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
mace,, 1
and, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
them, 1
to, 1
get, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
way;, 1
the, 1
criminal, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
rise,, 1
but,, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
had, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
mace, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
left, 1
temple., 1
A, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
heavy, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
man, 1
dropped, 1
like, 1
an, 1
ox, 1
on, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
over, 1
on, 1
his, 1
back., 1
The, 1
executioner, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
his, 1
mace,, 1
drew, 1
his, 1
knife,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
one, 1
stroke, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
throat,, 1
and, 1
mounting, 1
on, 1
his, 1
stomach,, 1
stamped, 1
violently, 1
on, 1
it, 1
with, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
At, 1
every, 1
stroke, 1
a, 1
jet, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
sprang, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wound., 1
This, 1
time, 1
Franz, 1
could, 1
contain, 1
himself, 1
no, 1
longer,, 1
but, 1
sank,, 1
half, 1
fainting,, 1
into, 1
a, 1
seat., 1
Albert,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
closed,, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
grasping, 1
the, 1
window-curtains., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
erect, 1
and, 1
triumphant,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Avenging, 1
Angel!, 1
Chapter, 1
36., 1
The, 1
Carnival, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
When, 1
Franz, 1
recovered, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Albert, 1
drinking, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
water,, 1
of, 1
which,, 1
to, 1
judge, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pallor,, 1
he, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
great, 1
need;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
assuming, 1
his, 1
masquerade, 1
costume., 1
He, 1
glanced, 1
mechanically, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
square--the, 1
scene, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
changed;, 1
scaffold,, 1
executioners,, 1
victims,, 1
all, 1
had, 1
disappeared;, 1
only, 1
the, 1
people, 1
remained,, 1
full, 1
of, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
excitement., 1
The, 1
bell, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Citorio,, 1
which, 1
only, 1
sounds, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pope's, 1
decease, 1
and, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
was, 1
ringing, 1
a, 1
joyous, 1
peal., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
he, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"what, 1
has,, 1
then,, 1
happened?", 1
"Nothing,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"only,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
has, 1
commenced., 1
Make, 1
haste, 1
and, 1
dress, 1
yourself.", 1
"In, 1
fact,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"this, 1
horrible, 1
scene, 1
has, 1
passed, 1
away, 1
like, 1
a, 1
dream.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
but, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
a, 1
nightmare,, 1
that, 1
has, 1
disturbed, 1
you.", 1
"Yes,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
suffered;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
culprit?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
also;, 1
only, 1
he, 1
has, 1
remained, 1
asleep,, 1
while, 1
you, 1
have, 1
awakened;, 1
and, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
which, 1
of, 1
you, 1
is, 1
the, 1
most, 1
fortunate?", 1
"But, 1
Peppino--what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
"Peppino, 1
is, 1
a, 1
lad, 1
of, 1
sense,, 1
who,, 1
unlike, 1
most, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
happy, 1
in, 1
proportion, 1
as, 1
they, 1
are, 1
noticed,, 1
was, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
the, 1
general, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
He, 1
profited, 1
by, 1
this, 1
distraction, 1
to, 1
slip, 1
away, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
without, 1
even, 1
thanking, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
priests, 1
who, 1
accompanied, 1
him., 1
Decidedly, 1
man, 1
is, 1
an, 1
ungrateful, 1
and, 1
egotistical, 1
animal., 1
But, 1
dress, 1
yourself;, 1
see,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
sets, 1
you, 1
the, 1
example.", 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
drawing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
satin, 1
pantaloon, 1
over, 1
his, 1
black, 1
trousers, 1
and, 1
varnished, 1
boots., 1
"Well,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
much, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
join, 1
the, 1
revels?, 1
Come,, 1
answer, 1
frankly.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
no,", 1
returned, 1
Albert., 1
"But, 1
I, 1
am, 1
really, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
such, 1
a, 1
sight;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
what, 1
the, 1
count, 1
said--that, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
once, 1
habituated, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
spectacle,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
that, 1
causes, 1
you, 1
any, 1
emotion.", 1
"Without, 1
reflecting, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
can, 1
study, 1
character,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"on, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
of, 1

must, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1

handsome,, 1
the, 1
hideous, 1
scoundrel!, 1
Come,, 1
dress, 1
yourselves,, 1
gentlemen,, 1
dress, 1
yourselves.", 1
Franz, 1
felt, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
ridiculous, 1
not, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
his, 1
two, 1
companions', 1

He, 1
assumed, 1
his, 1
costume,, 1
and, 1
fastened, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mask, 1
that, 1
scarcely, 1
equalled, 1
the, 1
pallor, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
face., 1

toilet, 1
finished,, 1

carriage, 1
awaited, 1
them, 1
at, 1

door,, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
sweetmeats, 1
and, 1
bouquets., 1
They, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
the, 1
line, 1
of, 1
carriages., 1
It, 1
is, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
form, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
perfect, 1
change, 1
that, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spectacle, 1
of, 1
gloomy, 1
and, 1
silent, 1
death,, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo, 1
presented, 1
a, 1
spectacle, 1
of, 1
gay, 1
and, 1
noisy, 1
mirth, 1
and, 1
revelry., 1
A, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
masks, 1
flowed, 1
in, 1
from, 1
all, 1
sides,, 1
emerging, 1
from, 1
the, 1
doors,, 1
descending, 1
from, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
From, 1
every, 1
street, 1
and, 1
every, 1
corner, 1
drove, 1
carriages, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
clowns,, 1
harlequins,, 1
dominoes,, 1
mummers,, 1
pantomimists,, 1
Transteverins,, 1
knights,, 1
and, 1
peasants,, 1
screaming,, 1
fighting,, 1
gesticulating,, 1
throwing, 1
eggs, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
flour,, 1
confetti,, 1

foes,, 1
companions, 1

strangers,, 1
indiscriminately,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
took, 1
offence,, 1
or, 1
did, 1
anything, 1
but, 1
laugh., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
were, 1
like, 1
men, 1
who,, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
away, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
sorrow,, 1
have, 1
recourse, 1
to, 1
wine,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
drink, 1

become, 1
intoxicated,, 1

a, 1
thick, 1
veil, 1
drawn, 1
between, 1
the, 1
past, 1

present., 1
They, 1
saw,, 1

rather, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
the, 1
image, 1
of, 1
what, 1
they, 1
had, 1
witnessed;, 1
but, 1
little, 1
by, 1
little, 1
the, 1
general, 1
vertigo, 1
seized, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
felt, 1
themselves, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
take, 1
part, 1
in, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
confusion., 1
A, 1
handful, 1
of, 1
confetti, 1
that, 1
came, 1
from, 1
a, 1
neighboring, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
while, 1
it, 1
covered, 1
Morcerf, 1
and, 1
his, 1
two, 1
companions, 1
with, 1
dust,, 1
pricked, 1
his, 1
neck, 1
and, 1
that, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
face, 1
uncovered, 1
by, 1
his, 1
mask, 1
like, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
pins,, 1
incited, 1
him, 1
to, 1
join, 1
in, 1
the, 1
general, 1
combat,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
all, 1
the, 1
masks, 1
around, 1
him, 1
were, 1
engaged., 1
He, 1
rose, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
seizing, 1
handfuls, 1
of, 1
confetti, 1
and, 1
sweetmeats,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
filled,, 1
cast, 1
them, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
force, 1
and, 1
skill, 1
he, 1
was, 1
master, 1
of., 1
The, 1
strife, 1
had, 1
fairly, 1
begun,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
what, 1
they, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
before, 1
was, 1
gradually, 1
effaced, 1
from, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men's, 1
minds,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
were, 1
they, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
gay, 1
and, 1
glittering, 1
procession, 1
they, 1
now, 1
beheld., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
never, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
shown, 1
any, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
having, 1
been, 1
moved., 1
Imagine, 1
the, 1
large, 1
and, 1
splendid, 1
Corso,, 1
bordered, 1
from, 1
one, 1
end, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
lofty, 1
palaces,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
balconies, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
carpets,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
windows, 1
with, 1
flags., 1
At, 1
these, 1
balconies, 1
are, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
spectators--Romans,, 1
Italians,, 1
strangers, 1
from, 1
all, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
the, 1
united, 1
aristocracy, 1
of, 1
birth,, 1
wealth,, 1
and, 1
genius., 1
Lovely, 1
women,, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scene,, 1
bend, 1
over, 1
their, 1
balconies,, 1
or, 1
lean, 1
from, 1
their, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
shower, 1
down, 1
confetti,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
returned, 1
by, 1
bouquets;, 1
the, 1
air, 1
seems, 1
darkened, 1
with, 1
the, 1
falling, 1
confetti, 1
and, 1
flying, 1
flowers., 1
In, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
the, 1
lively, 1
crowd, 1
is, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
fantastic, 1
costumes--gigantic, 1
cabbages, 1
walk, 1
gravely, 1
about,, 1
buffaloes', 1
heads, 1
bellow, 1
from, 1
men's, 1
shoulders,, 1
dogs, 1
walk, 1
on, 1
their, 1
hind, 1
legs;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
a, 1
mask, 1
is, 1
lifted,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
Callot's, 1
Temptation, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Anthony,, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
face, 1
is, 1
exhibited,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
would, 1
fain, 1
follow,, 1
but, 1
from, 1
which, 1
we, 1
are, 1
separated, 1
by, 1
troops, 1
of, 1
fiends., 1
This, 1
will, 1
give, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
At, 1
the, 1
second, 1
turn,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
stopped, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
requested, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
withdraw,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
at, 1
their, 1
disposal., 1
Franz, 1
looked, 1
up--they, 1
were, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace., 1
At, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
window,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
white, 1
damask, 1
with, 1
a, 1
red, 1
cross,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
domino,, 1
beneath, 1
which, 1
Franz's, 1
imagination, 1
easily, 1
pictured, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Argentina., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
springing, 1
out,, 1
"when, 1
you, 1
are, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
being, 1
actors,, 1
and, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
become, 1
spectators, 1
of, 1
this, 1
scene,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
you, 1
have, 1
places, 1
at, 1
my, 1
windows., 1
In, 1
the, 1
meantime,, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
my, 1
coachman,, 1
my, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
servants.", 1
We, 1
have, 1
forgotten, 1
to, 1
mention,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
coachman, 1
was, 1
attired, 1
in, 1
a, 1
bear-skin,, 1
exactly, 1
resembling, 1
Odry's, 1
in, 1
"The, 1
Bear, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Pasha;", 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
footmen, 1
behind, 1
were, 1
dressed, 1
up, 1
as, 1
green, 1
monkeys,, 1
with, 1
spring, 1
masks,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
they, 1
made, 1
grimaces, 1
at, 1
every, 1
one, 1
who, 1
passed., 1
Franz, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
for, 1
his, 1
attention., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Albert,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
busily, 1
occupied, 1
throwing, 1
bouquets, 1
at, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
full, 1
of, 1
Roman, 1
peasants, 1
that, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
near, 1
him., 1
Unfortunately, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
the, 1
line, 1
of, 1
carriages, 1
moved, 1
on, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
ascended, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
di, 1
Venezia., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Franz;, 1
"you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see?", 1
"What?", 1
"There,--that, 1
calash, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
Roman, 1
peasants.", 1
"No.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
convinced, 1
they, 1
are, 1
all, 1
charming, 1
women.", 1
"How, 1
unfortunate, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
masked,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Franz;, 1
"here, 1
was, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
making, 1
up, 1
for, 1
past, 1
disappointments.", 1
"Oh,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
half, 1
laughing,, 1
half, 1
serious;, 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
will, 1
not, 1
pass, 1
without, 1
some, 1
amends, 1
in, 1
one, 1
shape, 1
or, 1
the, 1
other.", 1
But,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
Albert's, 1
hope,, 1
the, 1
day, 1
passed, 1
unmarked, 1
by, 1
any, 1
incident,, 1
excepting, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
encounters, 1
with, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
full, 1
of, 1
Roman, 1
peasants., 1
At, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
encounters,, 1
accidentally, 1
or, 1
purposely,, 1
Albert's, 1
mask, 1
fell, 1
off., 1
He, 1
instantly, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
the, 1
remainder, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bouquets, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Doubtless, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
females, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
detected, 1
beneath, 1
their, 1
coquettish, 1
disguise, 1
was, 1
touched, 1
by, 1
his, 1
gallantry;, 1
for,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
passed, 1
her,, 1
she, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
violets., 1
Albert, 1
seized, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
was, 1
meant, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
suffered, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
retain, 1
it., 1
Albert, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
his, 1
button-hole,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
went, 1
triumphantly, 1
on., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
an, 1
adventure.", 1
"Laugh, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please--I, 1
really, 1
think, 1
so., 1
So, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
abandon, 1
this, 1
bouquet.", 1
"Pardieu,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
laughing,, 1
"in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
your, 1
ingratitude.", 1
The, 1
jest,, 1
however,, 1
soon, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
become, 1
earnest;, 1
for, 1
when, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
again, 1
encountered, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
the, 1
contadini,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
the, 1
violets, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
clapped, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
when, 1
she, 1
beheld, 1
them, 1
in, 1
his, 1
button-hole., 1
"Bravo,, 1
bravo,", 1
said, 1
Franz;, 1
"things, 1
go, 1
wonderfully., 1
Shall, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
you?, 1
Perhaps, 1
you, 1
would, 1
prefer, 1
being, 1
alone?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
caught, 1
like, 1
a, 1
fool, 1
at, 1
a, 1
first, 1
disclosure, 1
by, 1
a, 1
rendezvous, 1
under, 1
the, 1
clock,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
say, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera-balls., 1
If, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
peasant, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
matters, 1
any, 1
further,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
her,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
she, 1
will, 1
find, 1
us, 1
to-morrow;, 1
then, 1
she, 1
will, 1
give, 1
me, 1
some, 1
sign, 1
or, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
do.", 1
"On, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
wise, 1
as, 1
Nestor, 1
and, 1
prudent, 1
as, 1
Ulysses,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
fair, 1
Circe, 1
must, 1
be, 1
very, 1
skilful, 1
or, 1
very, 1
powerful, 1
if, 1
she, 1
succeed, 1
in, 1
changing, 1
you, 1
into, 1
a, 1
beast, 1
of, 1
any, 1
kind.", 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
right;, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
unknown, 1
had, 1
resolved,, 1
doubtless,, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
the, 1
intrigue, 1
no, 1
farther;, 1
for, 1
although, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men, 1
made, 1
several, 1
more, 1
turns,, 1
they, 1
did, 1
not, 1
again, 1
see, 1
the, 1
calash,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
up, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
neighboring, 1
streets., 1
Then, 1
they, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
domino, 1
had, 1
also, 1
disappeared;, 1
the, 1
two, 1
windows,, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
yellow, 1
damask,, 1
were, 1
still, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
invited., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
same, 1
bell, 1
that, 1
had, 1
proclaimed, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mascherata, 1
sounded, 1
the, 1
retreat., 1
The, 1
file, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Corso, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
line,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
second, 1
all, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
were, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
delle, 1
Maratte;, 1
the, 1
coachman,, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
drove, 1
up, 1
it,, 1
passed, 1
along, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
di, 1
Spagni, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
came, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
his, 1
guests., 1
Franz, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
after, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
express, 1
regret, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
returned, 1
in, 1
sufficient, 1
time;, 1
but, 1
Pastrini, 1
reassured, 1
him, 1
by, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
ordered, 1
a, 1
second, 1
carriage, 1
for, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
it, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
at, 1
four, 1
o'clock, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
him, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had,, 1
moreover,, 1
charged, 1
him, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
the, 1
key, 1
of, 1
his, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Argentina., 1
Franz, 1
questioned, 1
Albert, 1
as, 1
to, 1
his, 1
intentions;, 1
but, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
great, 1
projects, 1
to, 1
put, 1
into, 1
execution, 1
before, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
theatre;, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
making, 1
any, 1
answer,, 1
he, 1
inquired, 1
if, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
could, 1
procure, 1
him, 1
a, 1
tailor., 1
"A, 1
tailor,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
host;, 1
"and, 1
for, 1
what?", 1
"To, 1
make, 1
us, 1
between, 1
now, 1
and, 1
to-morrow, 1
two, 1
Roman, 1
peasant, 1
costumes,", 1
returned, 1
Albert., 1
The, 1
host, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"To, 1
make, 1
you, 1
two, 1
costumes, 1
between, 1
now, 1
and, 1
to-morrow?, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
your, 1
excellencies', 1
pardon,, 1
but, 1
this, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
French, 1
demand;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
week, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
find, 1
a, 1
single, 1
tailor, 1
who, 1
would, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
sew, 1
six, 1
buttons, 1
on, 1
a, 1
waistcoat, 1
if, 1
you, 1
paid, 1
him, 1
a, 1
crown, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
for, 1
each, 1
button.", 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
must, 1
give, 1
up, 1
the, 1
idea?", 1
"No;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
them, 1
ready-made., 1
Leave, 1
all, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
and, 1
to-morrow,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
awake,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
a, 1
collection, 1
of, 1
costumes, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
satisfied.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"leave, 1
all, 1
to, 1
our, 1
host;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
already, 1
proved, 1
himself, 1
full, 1
of, 1
resources;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
dine, 1
quietly,, 1
and, 1
afterwards, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see, 1
'The, 1
Algerian, 1
Captive.'", 1
"Agreed,", 1
returned, 1
Albert;, 1
"but, 1
remember,, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
that, 1
both, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
myself, 1
attach, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
importance, 1
to, 1
having, 1
to-morrow, 1
the, 1
costumes, 1
we, 1
have, 1
asked, 1
for.", 1
The, 1
host, 1
again, 1
assured, 1
them, 1
they, 1
might, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
their, 1
wishes, 1
should, 1
be, 1
attended, 1
to;, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
their, 1
apartments,, 1
and, 1
proceeded, 1
to, 1
disencumber, 1
themselves, 1
of, 1
their, 1
costumes., 1
Albert,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
took, 1
off, 1
his, 1
dress,, 1
carefully, 1
preserved, 1
the, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
violets;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
his, 1
token, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
the, 1
morrow., 1
The, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
to, 1
table;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
remarking, 1
the, 1
difference, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
table, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini., 1
Truth, 1
compelled, 1
Franz,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dislike, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
to, 1
confess, 1
that, 1
the, 1
advantage, 1
was, 1
not, 1
on, 1
Pastrini's, 1
side., 1
During, 1
dessert,, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
inquired, 1
at, 1
what, 1
time, 1
they, 1
wished, 1
for, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
fearing, 1
really, 1
to, 1
abuse, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
kindness., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
understood, 1
them., 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"given, 1
positive, 1
orders, 1
that, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
at, 1
their, 1
lordships', 1
orders, 1
all, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
could, 1
therefore, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
it, 1
without, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
indiscretion.", 1
They, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
courtesy,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
to, 1
be, 1
harnessed,, 1
while, 1
they, 1
substituted, 1
evening, 1
dress, 1
for, 1
that, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
somewhat, 1
the, 1
worse, 1
for, 1
the, 1
numerous, 1
combats, 1
they, 1
had, 1
sustained., 1
This, 1
precaution, 1
taken,, 1
they, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
theatre,, 1
and, 1
installed, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
box., 1
During, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act,, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----, 1
entered., 1
Her, 1
first, 1
look, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
box, 1
where, 1
she, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
count, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
she, 1
perceived, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
very, 1
person, 1
concerning, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
had, 1
expressed, 1
so, 1
strange, 1
an, 1
opinion, 1
to, 1
Franz., 1
Her, 1
opera-glass, 1
was, 1
so, 1
fixedly, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
them,, 1
that, 1
Franz, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
cruel, 1
not, 1
to, 1
satisfy, 1
her, 1
curiosity;, 1
and,, 1
availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
privileges, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
theatres,, 1
who, 1
use, 1
their, 1
boxes, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
receptions,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
went, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
their, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
they, 1
entered,, 1
when, 1
she, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
of, 1
honor., 1
Albert,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
sat, 1
behind., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
hardly, 1
giving, 1
Franz, 1
time, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
"it, 1
seems, 1
you, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
better, 1
to, 1
do, 1
than, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
acquaintance, 1
of, 1
this, 1
new, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
already, 1
the, 1
best, 1
friends, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Without, 1
being, 1
so, 1
far, 1
advanced, 1
as, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
countess,", 1
returned, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
deny, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
abused, 1
his, 1
good, 1
nature, 1
all, 1
day.", 1
"All, 1
day?", 1
"Yes;, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
we, 1
breakfasted, 1
with, 1
him;, 1
we, 1
rode, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
all, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
we, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
his, 1
box.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
him,, 1
then?", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
no.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
story.", 1
"Tell, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"It, 1
would, 1
frighten, 1
you, 1
too, 1
much.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
more, 1
reason.", 1
"At, 1
least, 1
wait, 1
until, 1
the, 1
story, 1
has, 1
a, 1
conclusion.", 1
"Very, 1
well;, 1
I, 1
prefer, 1
complete, 1
histories;, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
how, 1
you, 1
made, 1
his, 1
acquaintance?, 1
Did, 1
any, 1
one, 1
introduce, 1
you, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
"No;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
introduced, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
us.", 1
"When?", 1
"Last, 1
night,, 1
after, 1
we, 1
left, 1
you.", 1
"Through, 1
what, 1
medium?", 1
"The, 1
very, 1
prosaic, 1
one, 1
of, 1
our, 1
landlord.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
staying,, 1
then,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"Not, 1
only, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hotel,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
floor.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name--for,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
you, 1
know?", 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
family, 1
name?", 1
"No,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
island, 1
he, 1
has, 1
purchased.", 1
"And, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
count?", 1
"A, 1
Tuscan, 1
count.", 1
"Well,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
put, 1
up, 1
with, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
herself, 1
from, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oldest, 1
Venetian, 1
families., 1
"What, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"Ask, 1
the, 1
Vicomte, 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"You, 1
hear,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
referred, 1
to, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"We, 1
should, 1
be, 1
very, 1
hard, 1
to, 1
please,, 1
madam,", 1
returned, 1
Albert,, 1
"did, 1
we, 1
not, 1
think, 1
him, 1
delightful., 1
A, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
years', 1
standing, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
done, 1
more, 1
for, 1
us,, 1
or, 1
with, 1
a, 1
more, 1
perfect, 1
courtesy.", 1
"Come,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
smiling,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
my, 1
vampire, 1
is, 1
only, 1
some, 1
millionaire,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
Lara, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
being, 1
confounded, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Rothschild;, 1
and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
her?", 1
"Her?", 1
"The, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek, 1
of, 1
yesterday.", 1
"No;, 1
we, 1
heard,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
her, 1
guzla,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
remained, 1
perfectly, 1
invisible.", 1
"When, 1
you, 1
say, 1
invisible,", 1
interrupted, 1
Albert,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
the, 1
mystery;, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
take, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
domino, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window, 1
with, 1
the, 1
white, 1
curtains?", 1
"Where, 1
was, 1
this, 1
window, 1
with, 1
white, 1
hangings?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"At, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace.", 1
"The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace?", 1
"Yes., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Corso?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
notice, 1
two, 1
windows, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
yellow, 1
damask,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
with, 1
white, 1
damask, 1
with, 1
a, 1
red, 1
cross?, 1
Those, 1
were, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
windows.", 1
"Why,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
nabob., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
those, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
were, 1
worth?", 1
"Two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
Roman, 1
crowns?", 1
"Two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
thousand.", 1
"The, 1
deuce.", 1
"Does, 1
his, 1
island, 1
produce, 1
him, 1
such, 1
a, 1
revenue?", 1
"It, 1
does, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
a, 1
baiocco.", 1
"Then, 1
why, 1
did, 1
he, 1
purchase, 1
it?", 1
"For, 1
a, 1
whim.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
an, 1
original,, 1
then?", 1
"In, 1
reality,", 1
observed, 1
Albert,, 1
"he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
somewhat, 1
eccentric;, 1
were, 1
he, 1
at, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
frequenter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
theatres,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
devil, 1
literally, 1
mad., 1
This, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
made, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
exits, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
Didier, 1
or, 1
Anthony.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
visitor, 1
entered,, 1
and,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
custom,, 1
Franz, 1
gave, 1
up, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
to, 1
him., 1
This, 1
circumstance, 1
had,, 1
moreover,, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
the, 1
conversation;, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
their, 1
hotel., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
had, 1
already, 1
set, 1
about, 1
procuring, 1
their, 1
disguises, 1
for, 1
the, 1
morrow;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
assured, 1
them, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
be, 1
perfectly, 1
satisfied., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning,, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock,, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
Franz's, 1
room,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
tailor,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
eight, 1
or, 1
ten, 1
Roman, 1
peasant, 1
costumes, 1
on, 1
his, 1
arm;, 1
they, 1
selected, 1
two, 1
exactly, 1
alike,, 1
and, 1
charged, 1
the, 1
tailor, 1
to, 1
sew, 1
on, 1
each, 1
of, 1
their, 1
hats, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
yards, 1
of, 1
ribbon,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
them, 1
two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
long, 1
silk, 1
sashes, 1
of, 1
different, 1
colors, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
orders, 1
decorate, 1
themselves, 1
on, 1
fete-days., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
impatient, 1
to, 1
see, 1
how, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
in, 1
his, 1
new, 1
dress--a, 1
jacket, 1
and, 1
breeches, 1
of, 1
blue, 1
velvet,, 1
silk, 1
stockings, 1
with, 1
clocks,, 1
shoes, 1
with, 1
buckles,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
silk, 1
waistcoat., 1
This, 1
picturesque, 1
attire, 1
set, 1
him, 1
off, 1
to, 1
great, 1
advantage;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bound, 1
the, 1
scarf, 1
around, 1
his, 1
waist,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
placed, 1
coquettishly, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder, 1
a, 1
stream, 1
of, 1
ribbons,, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
confess, 1
that, 1
costume, 1
has, 1
much, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
the, 1
physical, 1
superiority, 1
we, 1
accord, 1
to, 1
certain, 1
nations., 1
The, 1
Turks, 1
used, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so, 1
picturesque, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
and, 1
flowing, 1
robes,, 1
but, 1
are, 1
they, 1
not, 1
now, 1
hideous, 1
with, 1
their, 1
blue, 1
frocks, 1
buttoned, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chin,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
red, 1
caps,, 1
which, 1
make, 1
them, 1
look, 1
like, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
with, 1
a, 1
red, 1
seal?, 1
Franz, 1
complimented, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
an, 1
unequivocal, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
satisfaction., 1
They, 1
were, 1
thus, 1
engaged, 1
when, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
entered., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"although, 1
a, 1
companion, 1
is, 1
agreeable,, 1
perfect, 1
freedom, 1
is, 1
sometimes, 1
still, 1
more, 1
agreeable., 1
I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
to-day,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
remainder, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
entirely, 1
at, 1
your, 1
disposal., 1
The, 1
host, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
I, 1
have, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
more,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
inconvenience, 1
me, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way., 1
Make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
you,, 1
for, 1
your, 1
pleasure, 1
or, 1
your, 1
business.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
men, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
decline,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
could, 1
find, 1
no, 1
good, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
refusing, 1
an, 1
offer, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
them., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
with, 1
them,, 1
conversing, 1
on, 1
all, 1
subjects, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
ease., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
already, 1
said,, 1
perfectly, 1
well, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
literature, 1
of, 1
all, 1
countries., 1
A, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
his, 1
salon, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
connoisseur, 1
of, 1
pictures., 1
A, 1
few, 1
words, 1
he, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
showed, 1
them, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
no, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sciences,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
much, 1
occupied, 1
with, 1
chemistry., 1
The, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
did, 1
not, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
return, 1
the, 1
count, 1
the, 1
breakfast, 1
he, 1
had, 1
given, 1
them;, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
too, 1
absurd, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
him, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
for, 1
his, 1
excellent, 1
table, 1
the, 1
very, 1
inferior, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini., 1
They, 1
told, 1
him, 1
so, 1
frankly,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
received, 1
their, 1
excuses, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
appreciated, 1
their, 1
delicacy., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
charmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
manners,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
prevented, 1
from, 1
recognizing, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
gentleman, 1
by, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
his, 1
varied, 1
knowledge., 1
The, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
do, 1
what, 1
he, 1
liked, 1
with, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
pleased, 1
him, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
peasants, 1
had, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
a, 1
most, 1
elegant, 1
carriage, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
not, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
be, 1
upon, 1
an, 1
equal, 1
footing, 1
with, 1
them., 1
At, 1
half-past, 1
one, 1
they, 1
descended,, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
and, 1
footman, 1
had, 1
put, 1
on, 1
their, 1
livery, 1
over, 1
their, 1
disguises,, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
them, 1
a, 1
more, 1
ridiculous, 1
appearance, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
gained, 1
them, 1
the, 1
applause, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert., 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
fastened, 1
the, 1
faded, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
violets, 1
to, 1
his, 1
button-hole., 1
At, 1
the, 1
first, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
they, 1
hastened, 1
into, 1
the, 1
Corso, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Vittoria., 1
At, 1
the, 1
second, 1
turn,, 1
a, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
fresh, 1
violets,, 1
thrown, 1
from, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
harlequins,, 1
indicated, 1
to, 1
Albert, 1
that,, 1
like, 1
himself, 1
and, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
the, 1
peasants, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
their, 1
costume,, 1
also;, 1
and, 1
whether, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
chance,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
feeling, 1
had, 1
possessed, 1
them, 1
both,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
his, 1
costume, 1
they, 1
had, 1
assumed, 1
his., 1
Albert, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
bouquet, 1
in, 1
his, 1
button-hole,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
the, 1
faded, 1
one, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
again, 1
met, 1
the, 1
calash,, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
an, 1
action, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
greatly, 1
to, 1
amuse, 1
not, 1
only, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
lady, 1
who, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
joyous, 1
companions, 1
also., 1
The, 1
day, 1
was, 1
as, 1
gay, 1
as, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
one,, 1
perhaps, 1
even, 1
more, 1
animated, 1
and, 1
noisy;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
appeared, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
at, 1
his, 1
window,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
they, 1
again, 1
passed, 1
he, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
It, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
needless, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
flirtation, 1
between, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
peasant, 1
continued, 1
all, 1
day., 1
In, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return,, 1
Franz, 1
found, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
embassy,, 1
informing, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
being, 1
received, 1
by, 1
his, 1
holiness, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day., 1
At, 1
each, 1
previous, 1
visit, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
to, 1
Rome,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
solicited, 1
and, 1
obtained, 1
the, 1
same, 1
favor;, 1
and, 1
incited, 1
as, 1
much, 1
by, 1
a, 1
religious, 1
feeling, 1
as, 1
by, 1
gratitude,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Christian, 1
world, 1
without, 1
laying, 1
his, 1
respectful, 1
homage, 1
at, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Peter's, 1
successors, 1
who, 1
has, 1
set, 1
the, 1
rare, 1
example, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
virtues., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
then, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival,, 1
for, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
condescension, 1
and, 1
touching, 1
kindness,, 1
one, 1
cannot, 1
incline, 1
one's, 1
self, 1
without, 1
awe, 1
before, 1
the, 1
venerable, 1
and, 1
noble, 1
old, 1
man, 1
called, 1
Gregory, 1
XVI., 1
On, 1
his, 1
return, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Vatican,, 1
Franz, 1
carefully, 1
avoided, 1
the, 1
Corso;, 1
he, 1
brought, 1
away, 1
with, 1
him, 1
a, 1
treasure, 1
of, 1
pious, 1
thoughts,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
mad, 1
gayety, 1
of, 1
the, 1
maskers, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
profanation., 1
At, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
past, 1
five, 1
Albert, 1
entered, 1
overjoyed., 1
The, 1
harlequin, 1
had, 1
reassumed, 1
her, 1
peasant's, 1
costume,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
she, 1
passed, 1
she, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
mask., 1
She, 1
was, 1
charming., 1
Franz, 1
congratulated, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
received, 1
his, 1
congratulations, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
conscious, 1
that, 1
they, 1
are, 1
merited., 1
He, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
by, 1
certain, 1
unmistakable, 1
signs,, 1
that, 1
his, 1
fair, 1
incognita, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
the, 1
aristocracy., 1
He, 1
had, 1
made, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
write, 1
to, 1
her, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day., 1
Franz, 1
remarked,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
these, 1
details,, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
something, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
it., 1
He, 1
insisted, 1
upon, 1
it,, 1
declaring, 1
beforehand, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
willing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
any, 1
sacrifice, 1
the, 1
other, 1
wished., 1
Albert, 1
let, 1
himself, 1
be, 1
pressed, 1
just, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
friendship, 1
required,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
avowed, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
do, 1
him, 1
a, 1
great, 1
favor, 1
by, 1
allowing, 1
him, 1
to, 1
occupy, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
alone, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day., 1
Albert, 1
attributed, 1
to, 1
Franz's, 1
absence, 1
the, 1
extreme, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
peasant, 1
in, 1
raising, 1
her, 1
mask., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
not, 1
sufficiently, 1
egotistical, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
an, 1
adventure, 1
that, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
so, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
his, 1
curiosity, 1
and, 1
so, 1
flattering, 1
to, 1
his, 1
vanity., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
the, 1
perfect, 1
indiscretion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
would, 1
duly, 1
inform, 1
him, 1
of, 1
all, 1
that, 1
happened;, 1
and, 1
as,, 1
during, 1
three, 1
years, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
travelled, 1
all, 1
over, 1
Italy,, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
had, 1
never, 1
fallen, 1
to, 1
his, 1
share,, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
how, 1
to, 1
act, 1
on, 1
such, 1
an, 1
occasion., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
promised, 1
Albert, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
content, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
morrow, 1
with, 1
witnessing, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
from, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rospoli, 1
Palace., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Albert, 1
pass, 1
and, 1
repass,, 1
holding, 1
an, 1
enormous, 1
bouquet,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
doubtless, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
bearer, 1
of, 1
his, 1
amorous, 1
epistle., 1
This, 1
belief, 1
was, 1
changed, 1
into, 1
certainty, 1
when, 1
Franz, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
bouquet, 1
(conspicuous, 1
by, 1
a, 1
circle, 1
of, 1
white, 1
camellias), 1
in, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
harlequin, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
rose-colored, 1
satin., 1
The, 1
evening, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
joy,, 1
but, 1
delirium., 1
Albert, 1
nothing, 1
doubted, 1
but, 1
that, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
unknown, 1
would, 1
reply, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
manner., 1
Franz, 1
anticipated, 1
his, 1
wishes, 1
by, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
fatigued, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day, 1
in, 1
writing, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
over, 1
his, 1
journal., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
not, 1
deceived,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
evening, 1
Franz, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
enter, 1
triumphantly, 1
shaking, 1
a, 1
folded, 1
paper, 1
which, 1
he, 1
held, 1
by, 1
one, 1
corner., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"was, 1
I, 1
mistaken?", 1
"She, 1
has, 1
answered, 1
you!", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"Read.", 1
This, 1
word, 1
was, 1
pronounced, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe., 1
Franz, 1
took, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
read:--, 1
Tuesday, 1
evening,, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock,, 1
descend, 1
from, 1
your, 1
carriage, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
dei, 1
Pontefici,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
peasant, 1
who, 1
snatches, 1
your, 1
torch, 1
from, 1
you., 1
When, 1
you, 1
arrive, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
step, 1
of, 1
the, 1
church, 1
of, 1
San, 1
Giacomo,, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
fasten, 1
a, 1
knot, 1
of, 1
rose-colored, 1
ribbons, 1
to, 1
the, 1
shoulder, 1
of, 1
your, 1
harlequin, 1
costume,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be, 1
recognized., 1
Until, 1
then, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
see, 1
me., 1
Constancy, 1
and, 1
Discretion., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
when, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
that?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
the, 1
adventure, 1
is, 1
assuming, 1
a, 1
very, 1
agreeable, 1
appearance.", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
also,", 1
replied, 1
Albert;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
very, 1
much, 1
fear, 1
you, 1
will, 1
go, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano's, 1
ball.", 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
received, 1
that, 1
morning, 1
an, 1
invitation, 1
from, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
Roman, 1
banker., 1
"Take, 1
care,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"All, 1
the, 1
nobility, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1
will, 1
be, 1
present,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
your, 1
fair, 1
incognita, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
the, 1
higher, 1
class, 1
of, 1
society,, 1
she, 1
must, 1
go, 1
there.", 1
"Whether, 1
she, 1
goes, 1
there, 1
or, 1
not,, 1
my, 1
opinion, 1
is, 1
still, 1
the, 1
same,", 1
returned, 1
Albert., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
how, 1
imperfectly, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mezzo, 1
cito, 1
are, 1
educated, 1
in, 1
Italy?", 1
(This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
class.), 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
again., 1
Look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
writing,, 1
and, 1
find, 1
if, 1
you, 1
can,, 1
any, 1
blemish, 1
in, 1
the, 1
language, 1
or, 1
orthography.", 1
(The, 1
writing, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
reality,, 1
charming,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
orthography, 1
irreproachable.), 1
"You, 1
are, 1
born, 1
to, 1
good, 1
fortune,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"Laugh, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
you, 1
will,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
love.", 1
"You, 1
alarm, 1
me,", 1
cried, 1
Franz., 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
only, 1
go, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano's,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Florence, 1
alone.", 1
"If, 1
my, 1
unknown, 1
be, 1
as, 1
amiable, 1
as, 1
she, 1
is, 1
beautiful,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
fix, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
for, 1
six, 1
weeks,, 1
at, 1
least., 1
I, 1
adore, 1
Rome,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
had, 1
a, 1
great, 1
taste, 1
for, 1
archaeology.", 1
"Come,, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
more, 1
such, 1
adventures,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
despair, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
you, 1
a, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Academy.", 1
Doubtless, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
discuss, 1
seriously, 1
his, 1
right, 1
to, 1
the, 1
academic, 1
chair, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
dinner, 1
was, 1
ready., 1
Albert's, 1
love, 1
had, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
his, 1
appetite., 1
He, 1
hastened, 1
with, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
seat, 1
himself,, 1
free, 1
to, 1
recommence, 1
the, 1
discussion, 1
after, 1
dinner., 1
After, 1
dinner,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
announced., 1
They, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
for, 1
two, 1
days., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
informed, 1
them, 1
that, 1
business, 1
had, 1
called, 1
him, 1
to, 1
Civita, 1
Vecchia., 1
He, 1
had, 1
started, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
only, 1
returned, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
since., 1
He, 1
was, 1
charming., 1
Whether, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
a, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
himself,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
by, 1
accident, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
sound, 1
the, 1
acrimonious, 1
chords, 1
that, 1
in, 1
other, 1
circumstances, 1
had, 1
been, 1
touched,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
to-night, 1
like, 1
everybody, 1
else., 1
The, 1
man, 1
was, 1
an, 1
enigma, 1
to, 1
Franz., 1
The, 1
count, 1
must, 1
feel, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
Franz, 1
recognized, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word, 1
indicating, 1
any, 1
previous, 1
acquaintance, 1
between, 1
them., 1
On, 1
his, 1
side,, 1
however, 1
great, 1
Franz's, 1
desire, 1
was, 1
to, 1
allude, 1
to, 1
their, 1
former, 1
interview,, 1
the, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
being, 1
disagreeable, 1
to, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
loaded, 1
him, 1
and, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
with, 1
kindness, 1
prevented, 1
him, 1
from, 1
mentioning, 1
it., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
a, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Argentina, 1
Theatre,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
told, 1
they, 1
were, 1
all, 1
let., 1
In, 1
consequence,, 1
he, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
the, 1
key, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own--at, 1
least, 1
such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
apparent, 1
motive, 1
of, 1
his, 1
visit., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
made, 1
some, 1
difficulty,, 1
alleging, 1
their, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
depriving, 1
him, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
replied, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Palli, 1
Theatre,, 1
the, 1
box, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Argentina, 1
Theatre, 1
would, 1
be, 1
lost, 1
if, 1
they, 1
did, 1
not, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
it., 1
This, 1
assurance, 1
determined, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
to, 1
accept, 1
it., 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
become, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
pallor,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
so, 1
forcibly, 1
struck, 1
him, 1
at, 1
their, 1
first, 1
meeting., 1
He, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
admiring, 1
the, 1
severe, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
defect,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
quality, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
pallor., 1
Truly,, 1
a, 1
Byronic, 1
hero!, 1
Franz, 1
could, 1
not,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
say, 1
see, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
even, 1
think, 1
of, 1
him, 1
without, 1
imagining, 1
his, 1
stern, 1
head, 1
upon, 1
Manfred's, 1
shoulders,, 1
or, 1
beneath, 1
Lara's, 1
helmet., 1
His, 1
forehead, 1
was, 1
marked, 1
with, 1
the, 1
line, 1
that, 1
indicates, 1
the, 1
constant, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
bitter, 1
thoughts;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
fiery, 1
eyes, 1
that, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
soul,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
haughty, 1
and, 1
disdainful, 1
upper, 1
lip, 1
that, 1
gives, 1
to, 1
the, 1
words, 1
it, 1
utters, 1
a, 1
peculiar, 1
character, 1
that, 1
impresses, 1
them, 1
on, 1
the, 1
minds, 1
of, 1
those, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
are, 1
addressed., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
young., 1
He, 1
was, 1
at, 1
least, 1
forty;, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
it, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
formed, 1
to, 1
rule, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
associated, 1
at, 1
present., 1
And,, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
his, 1
resemblance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
fantastic, 1
heroes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English, 1
poet,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
fascination., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
constantly, 1
expatiating, 1
on, 1
their, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
in, 1
meeting, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
less, 1
enthusiastic;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
exercised, 1
over, 1
him, 1
also, 1
the, 1
ascendency, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
mind, 1
always, 1
acquires, 1
over, 1
a, 1
mind, 1
less, 1
domineering., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
several, 1
times, 1
of, 1
the, 1
project, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
of, 1
visiting, 1
Paris;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
but, 1
that,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eccentric, 1
character,, 1
his, 1
characteristic, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
colossal, 1
fortune,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
produce, 1
a, 1
great, 1
effect, 1
there., 1
And, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
at, 1
Paris, 1
when, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
there., 1
The, 1
evening, 1
passed, 1
as, 1
evenings, 1
mostly, 1
pass, 1
at, 1
Italian, 1
theatres;, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
not, 1
in, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
the, 1
music,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
paying, 1
visits, 1
and, 1
conversing., 1
The, 1
Countess, 1
G----, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
revive, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
but, 1
Franz, 1
announced, 1
he, 1
had, 1
something, 1
far, 1
newer, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
her,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
Albert's, 1
demonstrations, 1
of, 1
false, 1
modesty,, 1
he, 1
informed, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
of, 1
the, 1
great, 1
event, 1
which, 1
had, 1
preoccupied, 1
them, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
days., 1
As, 1
similar, 1
intrigues, 1
are, 1
not, 1
uncommon, 1
in, 1
Italy,, 1
if, 1
we, 1
may, 1
credit, 1
travellers,, 1
the, 1
comtess, 1
did, 1
not, 1
manifest, 1
the, 1
least, 1
incredulity,, 1
but, 1
congratulated, 1
Albert, 1
on, 1
his, 1
success., 1
They, 1
promised,, 1
upon, 1
separating,, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano's, 1
ball,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
all, 1
Rome, 1
was, 1
invited., 1
The, 1
heroine, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bouquet, 1
kept, 1
her, 1
word;, 1
she, 1
gave, 1
Albert, 1
no, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
her, 1
existence, 1
the, 1
morrow, 1
or, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after., 1
At, 1
length, 1
Tuesday, 1
came,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
and, 1
most, 1
tumultuous, 1
day, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival., 1
On, 1
Tuesday,, 1
the, 1
theatres, 1
open, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
as, 1
Lent, 1
begins, 1
after, 1
eight, 1
at, 1
night., 1
On, 1
Tuesday,, 1
all, 1
those, 1
who, 1
through, 1
want, 1
of, 1
money,, 1
time,, 1
or, 1
enthusiasm,, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
before,, 1
mingle, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gayety,, 1
and, 1
contribute, 1
to, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
excitement., 1
From, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1
till, 1
five, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
followed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fete,, 1
exchanging, 1
handfuls, 1
of, 1
confetti, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
carriages, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pedestrians,, 1
who, 1
crowded, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
horses', 1
feet, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
wheels, 1
without, 1
a, 1
single, 1
accident,, 1
a, 1
single, 1
dispute,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
single, 1
fight., 1
The, 1
fetes, 1
are, 1
veritable, 1
pleasure, 1
days, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italians., 1
The, 1
author, 1
of, 1
this, 1
history,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
resided, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
years, 1
in, 1
Italy,, 1
does, 1
not, 1
recollect, 1
to, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
a, 1
ceremony, 1
interrupted, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
events, 1
so, 1
common, 1
in, 1
other, 1
countries., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
triumphant, 1
in, 1
his, 1
harlequin, 1
costume., 1
A, 1
knot, 1
of, 1
rose-colored, 1
ribbons, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
shoulder, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
In, 1
order, 1
that, 1
there, 1
might, 1
be, 1
no, 1
confusion,, 1
Franz, 1
wore, 1
his, 1
peasant's, 1
costume., 1
As, 1
the, 1
day, 1
advanced,, 1
the, 1
tumult, 1
became, 1
greater., 1
There, 1
was, 1
not, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pavement,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriages,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
a, 1
single, 1
tongue, 1
that, 1
was, 1
silent,, 1
a, 1
single, 1
arm, 1
that, 1
did, 1
not, 1
move., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
human, 1
storm,, 1
made, 1
up, 1
of, 1
a, 1
thunder, 1
of, 1
cries,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hail, 1
of, 1
sweetmeats,, 1
flowers,, 1
eggs,, 1
oranges,, 1
and, 1
nosegays., 1
At, 1
three, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
fireworks,, 1
let, 1
off, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
di, 1
Venezia, 1
(heard, 1
with, 1
difficulty, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
din, 1
and, 1
confusion), 1
announced, 1
that, 1
the, 1
races, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin., 1
The, 1
races,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
moccoli,, 1
are, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
episodes, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
days, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fireworks, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
instantly, 1
broke, 1
ranks,, 1
and, 1
retired, 1
by, 1
the, 1
adjacent, 1
streets., 1
All, 1
these, 1
evolutions, 1
are, 1
executed, 1
with, 1
an, 1
inconceivable, 1
address, 1
and, 1
marvellous, 1
rapidity,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
police, 1
interfering, 1
in, 1
the, 1
matter., 1
The, 1
pedestrians, 1
ranged, 1
themselves, 1
against, 1
the, 1
walls;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
trampling, 1
of, 1
horses, 1
and, 1
the, 1
clashing, 1
of, 1
steel, 1
were, 1
heard., 1
A, 1
detachment, 1
of, 1
carbineers,, 1
fifteen, 1
abreast,, 1
galloped, 1
up, 1
the, 1
Corso, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
clear, 1
it, 1
for, 1
the, 1
barberi., 1
When, 1
the, 1
detachment, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
di, 1
Venezia,, 1
a, 1
second, 1
volley, 1
of, 1
fireworks, 1
was, 1
discharged,, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
that, 1
the, 1
street, 1
was, 1
clear., 1
Almost, 1
instantly,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tremendous, 1
and, 1
general, 1
outcry,, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
horses,, 1
excited, 1
by, 1
the, 1
shouts, 1
of, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
spectators,, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
like, 1
lightning., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
Castle, 1
of, 1
Saint, 1
Angelo, 1
fired, 1
three, 1
cannon, 1
to, 1
indicate, 1
that, 1
number, 1
three, 1
had, 1
won., 1
Immediately,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
other, 1
signal,, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
moved, 1
on,, 1
flowing, 1
on, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Corso,, 1
down, 1
all, 1
the, 1
streets,, 1
like, 1
torrents, 1
pent, 1
up, 1
for, 1
a, 1
while,, 1
which, 1
again, 1
flow, 1
into, 1
the, 1
parent, 1
river;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
immense, 1
stream, 1
again, 1
continued, 1
its, 1
course, 1
between, 1
its, 1
two, 1
granite, 1
banks., 1
A, 1
new, 1
source, 1
of, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
movement, 1
was, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crowd., 1
The, 1
sellers, 1
of, 1
moccoletti, 1
entered, 1
on, 1
the, 1
scene., 1
The, 1
moccoli,, 1
or, 1
moccoletti,, 1
are, 1
candles, 1
which, 1
vary, 1
in, 1
size, 1
from, 1
the, 1
pascal, 1
taper, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rushlight,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
give, 1
to, 1
each, 1
actor, 1
in, 1
the, 1
great, 1
final, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Carnival, 1
two, 1
very, 1
serious, 1
problems, 1
to, 1
grapple, 1
with,--first,, 1
how, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
his, 1
own, 1
moccoletto, 1
alight;, 1
and, 1
secondly,, 1
how, 1
to, 1
extinguish, 1
the, 1
moccoletti, 1
of, 1
others., 1
The, 1
moccoletto, 1
is, 1
like, 1
life:, 1
man, 1
has, 1
found, 1
but, 1
one, 1
means, 1
of, 1
transmitting, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
one, 1
comes, 1
from, 1
God., 1
But, 1
he, 1
has, 1
discovered, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
means, 1
of, 1
taking, 1
it, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
has, 1
somewhat, 1
aided, 1
him., 1
The, 1
moccoletto, 1
is, 1
kindled, 1
by, 1
approaching, 1
it, 1
to, 1
a, 1
light., 1
But, 1
who, 1
can, 1
describe, 1
the, 1
thousand, 1
means, 1
of, 1
extinguishing, 1
the, 1
moccoletto?--the, 1
gigantic, 1
bellows,, 1
the, 1
monstrous, 1
extinguishers,, 1
the, 1
superhuman, 1
fans., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
moccoletti--Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rest., 1
The, 1
night, 1
was, 1
rapidly, 1
approaching;, 1
and, 1
already,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
"Moccoletti!", 1
repeated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
shrill, 1
voices, 1
of, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
vendors,, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
stars, 1
began, 1
to, 1
burn, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crowd., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
signal., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
lights, 1
glittered,, 1
descending, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
di, 1
Venezia, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Piazza, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
and, 1
mounting, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Piazzo, 1
del, 1
Popolo, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
di, 1
Venezia., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
fete, 1
of, 1
jack-o'-lanterns., 1
It, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
form, 1
any, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
it, 1
without, 1
having, 1
seen, 1
it., 1
Suppose, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
stars, 1
had, 1
descended, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sky, 1
and, 1
mingled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
wild, 1
dance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
the, 1
earth;, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
cries, 1
that, 1
were, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
any, 1
other, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world., 1
The, 1
facchino, 1
follows, 1
the, 1
prince,, 1
the, 1
Transteverin, 1
the, 1
citizen,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
blowing,, 1
extinguishing,, 1
relighting., 1
Had, 1
old, 1
AEolus, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
proclaimed, 1
king, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moccoli,, 1
and, 1
Aquilo, 1
the, 1
heir-presumptive, 1
to, 1
the, 1
throne., 1
This, 1
battle, 1
of, 1
folly, 1
and, 1
flame, 1
continued, 1
for, 1
two, 1
hours;, 1
the, 1
Corso, 1
was, 1
light, 1
as, 1
day;, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third, 1
and, 1
fourth, 1
stories, 1
were, 1
visible., 1
Every, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
Albert, 1
took, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch;, 1
at, 1
length, 1
it, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
seven., 1
The, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
dei, 1
Pontefici., 1
Albert, 1
sprang, 1
out,, 1
bearing, 1
his, 1
moccoletto, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
Two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
masks, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
knock, 1
his, 1
moccoletto, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
but, 1
Albert,, 1
a, 1
first-rate, 1
pugilist,, 1
sent, 1
them, 1
rolling, 1
in, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
one, 1
after, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
his, 1
course, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
church, 1
of, 1
San, 1
Giacomo., 1
The, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
crowded, 1
with, 1
masks,, 1
who, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
snatch, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
torches., 1
Franz, 1
followed, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
mount, 1
the, 1
first, 1
step., 1
Instantly, 1
a, 1
mask,, 1
wearing, 1
the, 1
well-known, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
a, 1
peasant, 1
woman,, 1
snatched, 1
his, 1
moccoletto, 1
from, 1
him, 1
without, 1
his, 1
offering, 1
any, 1
resistance., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
too, 1
far, 1
off, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
what, 1
they, 1
said;, 1
but,, 1
without, 1
doubt,, 1
nothing, 1
hostile, 1
passed,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Albert, 1
disappear, 1
arm-in-arm, 1
with, 1
the, 1
peasant, 1
girl., 1
He, 1
watched, 1
them, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
length, 1
he, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Macello., 1
Suddenly, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
that, 1
gives, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
for, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carnival, 1
sounded,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
all, 1
the, 1
moccoletti, 1
were, 1
extinguished, 1
as, 1
if, 1
by, 1
enchantment., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
one, 1
immense, 1
blast, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
had, 1
extinguished, 1
every, 1
one., 1
Franz, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
darkness., 1
No, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
audible, 1
save, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
that, 1
were, 1
carrying, 1
the, 1
maskers, 1
home;, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
visible, 1
save, 1
a, 1
few, 1
lights, 1
that, 1
burnt, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
The, 1
Carnival, 1
was, 1
over., 1
Chapter, 1
37., 1
The, 1
Catacombs, 1
of, 1
Saint, 1
Sebastian., 1
In, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
life,, 1
perhaps,, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
never, 1
before, 1
experienced, 1
so, 1
sudden, 1
an, 1
impression,, 1
so, 1
rapid, 1
a, 1
transition, 1
from, 1
gayety, 1
to, 1
sadness,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
this, 1
moment., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
Rome,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
magic, 1
breath, 1
of, 1
some, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
had, 1
suddenly, 1
changed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
tomb., 1
By, 1
a, 1
chance,, 1
which, 1
added, 1
yet, 1
more, 1
to, 1
the, 1
intensity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
the, 1
moon,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wane,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
rise, 1
until, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
which, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
traversed, 1
were, 1
plunged, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
obscurity., 1
The, 1
distance, 1
was, 1
short,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
count's,, 1
stopped, 1
before, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres., 1
Dinner, 1
was, 1
waiting,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
told, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
not, 1
return, 1
so, 1
soon,, 1
Franz, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
without, 1
him., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
see, 1
them, 1
dine, 1
together,, 1
inquired, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
absence,, 1
but, 1
Franz, 1
merely, 1
replied, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
received, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening, 1
an, 1
invitation, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
accepted., 1
The, 1
sudden, 1
extinction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moccoletti,, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
which, 1
had, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
which, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
the, 1
turmoil,, 1
had, 1
left, 1
in, 1
Franz's, 1
mind, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
depression, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
free, 1
from, 1
uneasiness., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
dined, 1
very, 1
silently,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
officious, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
his, 1
host,, 1
who, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
if, 1
he, 1
wanted, 1
anything., 1
Franz, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
Albert, 1
as, 1
late, 1
as, 1
possible., 1
He, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
therefore,, 1
for, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock,, 1
desiring, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
him, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
At, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
not, 1
come, 1
back., 1
Franz, 1
dressed, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
telling, 1
his, 1
host, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
night, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano's., 1
The, 1
house, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
delightful, 1
in, 1
Rome,, 1
the, 1
duchess,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
last, 1
heiresses, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Colonnas,, 1
does, 1
its, 1
honors, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
consummate, 1
grace,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
their, 1
fetes, 1
have, 1
a, 1
European, 1
celebrity., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
Rome, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
introduction, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
first, 1
question, 1
on, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
was, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
the, 1
whereabouts, 1
of, 1
his, 1
travelling, 1
companion., 1
Franz, 1
replied, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
they, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
extinguish, 1
the, 1
moccoli,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Macello., 1
"Then, 1
he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
returned?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
duke., 1
"I, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
him, 1
until, 1
this, 1
hour,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
went?", 1
"No,, 1
not, 1
precisely;, 1
however,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
was, 1
something, 1
very, 1
like, 1
a, 1
rendezvous.", 1
"Diavolo!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
duke,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
day,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
night,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
out, 1
late;, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not,, 1
countess!", 1
These, 1
words, 1
were, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
arrived,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Torlonia,, 1
the, 1
duke's, 1
brother., 1
"I, 1
think,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
night,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"and, 1
those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
here, 1
will, 1
complain, 1
of, 1
but, 1
one, 1
thing--its, 1
too, 1
rapid, 1
flight.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
speaking,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
duke, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"of, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
are, 1
here;, 1
the, 1
men, 1
run, 1
no, 1
other, 1
danger, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
falling, 1
in, 1
love, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
falling, 1
ill, 1
of, 1
jealousy, 1
at, 1
seeing, 1
you, 1
so, 1
lovely;, 1
I, 1
meant, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
were, 1
out, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
of, 1
Rome.", 1
"Ah,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"who, 1
is, 1
out, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1
at, 1
this, 1
hour,, 1
unless, 1
it, 1
be, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
a, 1
ball?", 1
"Our, 1
friend,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
countess,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
left, 1
in, 1
pursuit, 1
of, 1
his, 1
unknown, 1
about, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
this, 1
evening,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"and, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
since.", 1
"And, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
know, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is?", 1
"Not, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
armed?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
in, 1
masquerade.", 1
"You, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
allowed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
go,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
duke, 1
to, 1
Franz;, 1
"you,, 1
who, 1
know, 1
Rome, 1
better, 1
than, 1
he, 1
does.", 1
"You, 1
might, 1
as, 1
well, 1
have, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
number, 1
three, 1
of, 1
the, 1
barberi,, 1
who, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
prize, 1
in, 1
the, 1
race, 1
to-day,", 1
replied, 1
Franz;, 1
"and, 1
then, 1
moreover,, 1
what, 1
could, 1
happen, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
"Who, 1
can, 1
tell?, 1
The, 1
night, 1
is, 1
gloomy,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Tiber, 1
is, 1
very, 1
near, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Macello.", 1
Franz, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
shudder, 1
run, 1
through, 1
his, 1
veins, 1
at, 1
observing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
duke, 1
and, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
was, 1
so, 1
much, 1
in, 1
unison, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own, 1
personal, 1
disquietude., 1
"I, 1
informed, 1
them, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
night, 1
here,, 1
duke,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"and, 1
desired, 1
them, 1
to, 1
come, 1
and, 1
inform, 1
me, 1
of, 1
his, 1
return.", 1
"Ah,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
duke,, 1
"here, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
servants, 1
who, 1
is, 1
seeking, 1
you.", 1
The, 1
duke, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken;, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Franz,, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
came, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"Your, 1
excellency,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"the, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres, 1
has, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
let, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
is, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
you, 1
with, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Viscount, 1
of, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"A, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
viscount!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Franz., 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
is, 1
the, 1
man?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know.", 1
"Why, 1
did, 1
he, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me, 1
here?", 1
"The, 1
messenger, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say.", 1
"And, 1
where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
messenger?", 1
"He, 1
went, 1
away, 1
directly, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
me, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
ball-room, 1
to, 1
find, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
"go, 1
with, 1
all, 1
speed--poor, 1
young, 1
man!, 1
Perhaps, 1
some, 1
accident, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
hasten,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"Shall, 1
we, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again, 1
to, 1
give, 1
us, 1
any, 1
information?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"Yes,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
any, 1
serious, 1
affair,, 1
otherwise, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
answer, 1
as, 1
to, 1
what, 1
I, 1
may, 1
do, 1
myself.", 1
"Be, 1
prudent,, 1
in, 1
any, 1
event,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"Oh,, 1
pray, 1
be, 1
assured, 1
of, 1
that.", 1
Franz, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
and, 1
went, 1
away, 1
in, 1
haste., 1
He, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
away, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
orders, 1
for, 1
it, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
him, 1
at, 1
two, 1
o'clock;, 1
fortunately, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Bracciano,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Corso,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Square, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
Apostles,, 1
is, 1
hardly, 1
ten, 1
minutes', 1
walk, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Londres., 1
As, 1
he, 1
came, 1
near, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
Franz, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street., 1
He, 1
had, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
messenger, 1
from, 1
Albert., 1
The, 1
man, 1
was, 1
wrapped, 1
up, 1
in, 1
a, 1
large, 1
cloak., 1
He, 1
went, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
extreme, 1
astonishment,, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
first, 1
addressed, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
wants, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
retreating, 1
a, 1
step, 1
or, 1
two,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
on, 1
his, 1
guard., 1
"Are, 1
not, 1
you, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
brought, 1
me, 1
a, 1
letter,", 1
inquired, 1
Franz,, 1
"from, 1
the, 1
Viscount, 1
of, 1
Morcerf?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
lodges, 1
at, 1
Pastrini's, 1
hotel?", 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
the, 1
travelling, 1
companion, 1
of, 1
the, 1

"I, 1
am.", 1
"Your, 1
excellency's, 1
name"--, 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay.", 1
"Then, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
that, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
is, 1
addressed.", 1
"Is, 1
there, 1
any, 1
answer?", 1
inquired, 1
Franz,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
him., 1
"Yes--your, 1
friend, 1
at, 1
least, 1
hopes, 1
so.", 1
"Come, 1
up-stairs, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
prefer, 1
waiting, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
messenger,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"And, 1
why?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
know, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
find, 1
you, 1
here,, 1
then?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
Franz, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
On, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
he, 1
met, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini., 1
"Well?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
landlord., 1
"Well--what?", 1
responded, 1
Franz., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
you, 1
from, 1
your, 1
friend?", 1
he, 1
asked, 1
of, 1
Franz., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
him,", 1
he, 1
replied,, 1
"and, 1
he, 1
has, 1
handed, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
me., 1
Light, 1
the, 1
candles, 1
in, 1
my, 1
apartment,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
The, 1
inn-keeper, 1
gave, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
to, 1
go, 1
before, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
a, 1
light., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
found, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
looking, 1
very, 1
much, 1
alarmed,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
had, 1
only, 1
made, 1
him, 1
the, 1
more, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
read, 1
Albert's, 1
letter;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
he, 1
went, 1
instantly, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
waxlight,, 1
and, 1
unfolded, 1
it., 1
It, 1
was, 1
written, 1
and, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
Albert., 1
Franz, 1
read, 1
it, 1
twice, 1
before, 1
he, 1
could, 1
comprehend, 1
what, 1
it, 1
contained., 1
It, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
worded:--, 1
My, 1
Dear, 1
Fellow,--The, 1
moment, 1
you, 1
have, 1
received, 1
this,, 1
have, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
credit, 1
from, 1
my, 1
pocket-book,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
in, 1
the, 1
square, 1
drawer, 1
of, 1
the, 1
secretary;, 1
add, 1
your, 1
own, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
not, 1
sufficient., 1
Run, 1
to, 1
Torlonia,, 1
draw, 1
from, 1
him, 1
instantly, 1
four, 1
thousand, 1
piastres,, 1
and, 1
give, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bearer., 1
It, 1
is, 1
urgent, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
this, 1
money, 1
without, 1
delay., 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
more,, 1
relying, 1
on, 1
you, 1
as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
me., 1
Your, 1
friend,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
P.S.--I, 1
now, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
Italian, 1
banditti., 1
Below, 1
these, 1
lines, 1
were, 1
written,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
following, 1
in, 1
Italian:--, 1
Se, 1
alle, 1
sei, 1
della, 1
mattina, 1
le, 1
quattro, 1
mile, 1
piastre, 1
non, 1
sono, 1
nelle, 1
mie, 1
mani,, 1
alla, 1
sette, 1
il, 1
conte, 1
Alberto, 1
avra, 1
cessato, 1
di, 1

Luigi, 1
Vampa., 1
"If, 1
by, 1
six, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
the, 1
four, 1
thousand, 1
piastres, 1
are, 1
not, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands,, 1
by, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
Albert, 1
will, 1
have, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
live.", 1
This, 1
second, 1
signature, 1
explained, 1
everything, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
now, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
objection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
messenger, 1
to, 1
coming, 1
up, 1
into, 1
the, 1
apartment;, 1
the, 1
street, 1
was, 1
safer, 1
for, 1
him., 1
Albert,, 1
then,, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
bandit, 1
chief,, 1
in, 1
whose, 1
existence, 1
he, 1
had, 1
for, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
believe., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose., 1
He, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
secretary,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
the, 1
pocket-book, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawer,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
it, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
credit., 1
There, 1
were, 1
in, 1
all, 1
six, 1
thousand, 1
piastres,, 1
but, 1
of, 1
these, 1
six, 1
thousand, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
already, 1
expended, 1
three, 1
thousand., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
credit,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
lived, 1
at, 1
Florence,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
only, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Rome, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
days;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
but, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
louis,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
these, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
more, 1
than, 1
fifty, 1
left., 1
Thus, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
hundred, 1
piastres, 1
were, 1
wanting, 1
to, 1
them, 1
both, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
required., 1
True,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
case, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Torlonia., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
therefore,, 1
about, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
Bracciano, 1
without, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
a, 1
luminous, 1
idea, 1
crossed, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
He, 1
remembered, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
ring, 1
for, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini,, 1
when, 1
that, 1
worthy, 1
presented, 1
himself., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
hastily,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
if, 1
the, 1
count, 1
is, 1
within?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
returned.", 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
in, 1
bed?", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
no.", 1
"Then, 1
ring, 1
at, 1
his, 1
door,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
and, 1
request, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so, 1
kind, 1
as, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
an, 1
audience.", 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
did, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desired,, 1
and, 1
returning, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
after,, 1
he, 1
said,--"The, 1
count, 1
awaits, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
Franz, 1
went, 1
along, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
introduced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count., 1
He, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
room, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
seen,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
surrounded, 1
with, 1
divans., 1
The, 1
count, 1
came, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
good, 1
wind, 1
blows, 1
you, 1
hither, 1
at, 1
this, 1
hour?", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
sup, 1
with, 1
me?, 1
It, 1
would, 1
be, 1
very, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you, 1
of, 1
a, 1
very, 1
serious, 1
matter.", 1
"A, 1
serious, 1
matter,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
the, 1
earnestness, 1
usual, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
"and, 1
what, 1
may, 1
it, 1
be?", 1
"Are, 1
we, 1
alone?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
returning., 1
Franz, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
Albert's, 1
letter., 1
"Read, 1
that,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
The, 1
count, 1
read, 1
it., 1
"Well,, 1
well!", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
see, 1
the, 1
postscript?", 1
"I, 1
did,, 1
indeed., 1
"'Se, 1
alle, 1

"'Luigi, 1
Vampa.'", 1
"What, 1
think, 1
you, 1
of, 1
that?", 1
inquired, 1
Franz., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
the, 1
money, 1
he, 1
demands?", 1
"Yes,, 1
all, 1
but, 1
eight, 1
hundred, 1
piastres.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
went, 1
to, 1
his, 1
secretary,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
pulling, 1
out, 1
a, 1
drawer, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Franz,--"I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
offend, 1
me, 1
by, 1
applying, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
but, 1
myself.", 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
you, 1
first, 1
and, 1
instantly,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you;, 1
have, 1
what, 1
you, 1
will;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
take, 1
what, 1
he, 1
pleased., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
absolutely, 1
necessary,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
send, 1
the, 1
money, 1
to, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
looking, 1
fixedly, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Judge, 1
for, 1
yourself,", 1
replied, 1
he., 1
"The, 1
postscript, 1
is, 1
explicit.", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
if, 1
you, 1
would, 1
take, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
of, 1
reflecting,, 1
you, 1
could, 1
find, 1
a, 1
way, 1
of, 1
simplifying, 1
the, 1
negotiation,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
surprise., 1
"If, 1
we, 1
were, 1
to, 1
go, 1
together, 1
to, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
refuse, 1
you, 1
Albert's, 1
freedom.", 1
"What, 1
influence, 1
can, 1
I, 1
possibly, 1
have, 1
over, 1
a, 1
bandit?", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
just, 1
rendered, 1
him, 1
a, 1
service, 1
that, 1
can, 1
never, 1
be, 1
forgotten?", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
saved, 1
Peppino's, 1
life?", 1
"Well,, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"who, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that?", 1
"No, 1
matter;, 1
I, 1
know, 1
it.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
knit, 1
his, 1
brows,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
an, 1
instant., 1
"And, 1
if, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1

would, 1
you, 1
accompany, 1
me?", 1

my, 1
society, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
disagreeable.", 1
"Be, 1
it, 1
so., 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
walk, 1
without, 1
Rome, 1
will, 1
do, 1
us, 1
both, 1
good.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
take, 1
any, 1
arms?", 1
"For, 1
what, 1
purpose?", 1
"Any, 1
money?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
useless., 1
Where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
brought, 1
the, 1
letter?", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
street.", 1
"He, 1
awaits, 1
the, 1
answer?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
must, 1
learn, 1
where, 1

are, 1
going., 1
I, 1
will, 1
summon, 1
him, 1
hither.", 1

is, 1
useless;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
come, 1
up.", 1
"To, 1
your, 1
apartments,, 1
perhaps;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
make, 1
any, 1
difficulty, 1
at, 1
entering, 1
mine.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
that, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
and, 1
whistled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
peculiar, 1
manner., 1
The, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
into, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street., 1
"Salite!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
given, 1
an, 1
order, 1
to, 1
his, 1
servant., 1
The, 1
messenger, 1
obeyed, 1
without, 1
the, 1
least, 1
hesitation,, 1
but, 1
rather, 1
with, 1
alacrity,, 1
and,, 1
mounting, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
at, 1
a, 1
bound,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
hotel;, 1
five, 1
seconds, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Ah,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
you,, 1
Peppino,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
But, 1
Peppino,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
answering,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
kisses., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
have,, 1
then,, 1
not, 1
forgotten, 1
that, 1
I, 1
saved, 1
your, 1
life;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
strange,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
week, 1
ago.", 1
"No,, 1
excellency;, 1
and, 1
never, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
forget, 1
it,", 1
returned, 1
Peppino,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
gratitude., 1
"Never?, 1
That, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
something, 1
that, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
so., 1
Rise, 1
and, 1
answer.", 1
Peppino, 1
glanced, 1
anxiously, 1
at, 1
Franz., 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
may, 1

excellency,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friends., 1
You, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
this, 1
title?", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
French,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
this, 1
man's, 1
confidence.", 1
"You, 1
can, 1
speak, 1
before, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Franz;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's.", 1
"Good!", 1
returned, 1
Peppino., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
any, 1
questions, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
may, 1
address, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"How, 1
did, 1
the, 1
Viscount, 1
Albert, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
Luigi's, 1
hands?", 1
"Excellency,, 1
the, 1
Frenchman's, 1
carriage, 1
passed, 1
several, 1
times, 1
the, 1
one, 1
in, 1
which, 1
was, 1
Teresa.", 1
"The, 1
chief's, 1
mistress?", 1
"Yes., 1
The, 1
Frenchman, 1
threw, 1
her, 1
a, 1
bouquet;, 1
Teresa, 1
returned, 1
it--all, 1
this, 1
with, 1
the, 1
consent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage.", 1
"What?", 1
cried, 1
Franz,, 1
"was, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
peasants?", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
drove,, 1
disguised, 1
as, 1
the, 1
coachman,", 1
replied, 1
Peppino., 1
"Well?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
took, 1
off, 1
his, 1
mask;, 1
Teresa,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
chief's, 1
consent,, 1
did, 1
the, 1
same., 1
The, 1
Frenchman, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
rendezvous;, 1
Teresa, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
one--only,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
Teresa,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Beppo, 1
who, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
church, 1
of, 1
San, 1
Giacomo.", 1
"What!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Franz,, 1
"the, 1
peasant, 1
girl, 1
who, 1
snatched, 1
his, 1
mocoletto, 1
from, 1
him"--, 1
"Was, 1
a, 1
lad, 1
of, 1
fifteen,", 1
replied, 1
Peppino., 1
"But, 1
it, 1
was, 1
no, 1
disgrace, 1
to, 1
your, 1
friend, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deceived;, 1
Beppo, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
in, 1
plenty, 1
of, 1
others.", 1
"And, 1
Beppo, 1
led, 1
him, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
walls?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Exactly, 1
so;, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
Macello., 1
Beppo, 1
got, 1
in,, 1
inviting, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
to, 1
be, 1
asked, 1
twice., 1
He, 1
gallantly, 1
offered, 1
the, 1
right-hand, 1
seat, 1
to, 1
Beppo,, 1
and, 1
sat, 1
by, 1
him., 1
Beppo, 1
told, 1
him, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
take, 1
him, 1
to, 1
a, 1
villa, 1
a, 1
league, 1
from, 1
Rome;, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
assured, 1
him, 1
he, 1
would, 1
follow, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world., 1
The, 1
coachman, 1
went, 1
up, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
di, 1
Ripetta, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Porta, 1
San, 1
Paola;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
yards, 1
outside,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
became, 1
somewhat, 1
too, 1
forward,, 1
Beppo, 1
put, 1
a, 1
brace, 1
of, 1
pistols, 1
to, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
pulled, 1
up, 1
and, 1
did, 1
the, 1
same., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
four, 1
of, 1
the, 1
band,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
concealed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Almo,, 1
surrounded, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
The, 1
Frenchman, 1
made, 1
some, 1
resistance,, 1
and, 1
nearly, 1
strangled, 1
Beppo;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
five, 1
armed, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
yield., 1
They, 1
made, 1
him, 1
get, 1
out,, 1
walk, 1
along, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
river,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
to, 1
Teresa, 1
and, 1
Luigi,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
catacombs, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Sebastian.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Franz,, 1
"it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
story., 1
What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say, 1
to, 1
it?", 1
"Why,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
think, 1
it, 1
very, 1
amusing,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"if, 1
it, 1
had, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
but, 1
poor, 1
Albert.", 1
"And,, 1
in, 1
truth,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
not, 1
found, 1
me, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"it, 1
might, 1
have, 1
proved, 1
a, 1
gallant, 1
adventure, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
cost, 1
your, 1
friend, 1
dear;, 1
but, 1
now,, 1
be, 1
assured,, 1
his, 1
alarm, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
only, 1
serious, 1
consequence.", 1
"And, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
go, 1
and, 1
find, 1
him?", 1
inquired, 1
Franz., 1
"Oh,, 1
decidedly,, 1
sir., 1
He, 1
is, 1
in, 1
a, 1
very, 1
picturesque, 1
place--do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
catacombs, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Sebastian?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
never, 1
in, 1
them;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
often, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
them.", 1
"Well,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
made, 1
to, 1
your, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
contrive, 1
a, 1
better., 1
Have, 1
you, 1
a, 1
carriage?", 1
"No.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
of, 1
no, 1
consequence;, 1
I, 1
always, 1
have, 1
one, 1
ready,, 1
day, 1
and, 1
night.", 1
"Always, 1
ready?", 1
"Yes., 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
very, 1
capricious, 1
being,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
sometimes, 1
when, 1
I, 1
rise,, 1
or, 1
after, 1
my, 1
dinner,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
I, 1
resolve, 1
on, 1
starting, 1
for, 1
some, 1
particular, 1
point,, 1
and, 1
away, 1
I, 1
go.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
rang,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
footman, 1
appeared., 1
"Order, 1
out, 1
the, 1
carriage,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"and, 1
remove, 1
the, 1
pistols, 1
which, 1
are, 1
in, 1
the, 1
holsters., 1
You, 1
need, 1
not, 1
awaken, 1
the, 1
coachman;, 1
Ali, 1
will, 1
drive.", 1
In, 1
a, 1
very, 1
short, 1
time, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
wheels, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
count, 1
took, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch., 1
"Half-past, 1
twelve,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"We, 1
might, 1
start, 1
at, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
and, 1
be, 1
in, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
delay, 1
may, 1
cause, 1
your, 1
friend, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
an, 1
uneasy, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
we, 1
had, 1
better, 1
go, 1
with, 1
all, 1
speed, 1
to, 1
extricate, 1
him, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
infidels., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
still, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
me?", 1
"More, 1
determined, 1
than, 1
ever.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
come, 1
along.", 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
went, 1
downstairs,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Peppino., 1
At, 1
the, 1
door, 1
they, 1
found, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Ali, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
in, 1
whom, 1
Franz, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
dumb, 1
slave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
got, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Peppino, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
beside, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
set, 1
off, 1
at, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
pace., 1
Ali, 1
had, 1
received, 1
his, 1
instructions,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Corso,, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
Campo, 1
Vaccino,, 1
went, 1
up, 1
the, 1
Strada, 1
San, 1
Gregorio,, 1
and, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
gates, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Sebastian., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
raised, 1
some, 1
difficulties,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
permit, 1
from, 1
the, 1
governor, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
allowing, 1
him, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
or, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
city, 1
at, 1
any, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
or, 1
night;, 1
the, 1
portcullis, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
raised,, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
had, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
for, 1
his, 1
trouble,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
went, 1
on, 1
their, 1
way., 1
The, 1
road, 1
which, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
now, 1
traversed, 1
was, 1
the, 1
ancient, 1
Appian, 1
Way,, 1
and, 1
bordered, 1
with, 1
tombs., 1
From, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moon,, 1
which, 1
began, 1
to, 1
rise,, 1
Franz, 1
imagined, 1
that, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
something, 1
like, 1
a, 1
sentinel, 1
appear, 1
at, 1
various, 1
points, 1
among, 1
the, 1
ruins,, 1
and, 1
suddenly, 1
retreat, 1
into, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
on, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
from, 1
Peppino., 1
A, 1
short, 1
time, 1
before, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
Baths, 1
of, 1
Caracalla, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
stopped,, 1
Peppino, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
alighted., 1
"In, 1
ten, 1
minutes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
"we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
there.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
Peppino, 1
aside,, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
an, 1
order, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
Peppino, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
taking, 1
with, 1
him, 1
a, 1
torch,, 1
brought, 1
with, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
elapsed,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Franz, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
shepherd, 1
going, 1
along, 1
a, 1
narrow, 1
path, 1
that, 1
led, 1
over, 1
the, 1
irregular, 1
and, 1
broken, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Campagna;, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
he, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tall, 1
red, 1
herbage,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
bristling, 1
mane, 1
of, 1
an, 1
enormous, 1
lion., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
follow, 1
him.", 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
their, 1
turn, 1
then, 1
advanced, 1
along, 1
the, 1
same, 1
path,, 1
which,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
paces,, 1
led, 1
them, 1
over, 1
a, 1
declivity, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
valley., 1
They, 1
then, 1
perceived, 1
two, 1
men, 1
conversing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
obscurity., 1
"Ought, 1
we, 1
to, 1
go, 1
on?", 1
asked, 1
Franz, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"or, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
wait, 1
awhile?", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
on;, 1
Peppino, 1
will, 1
have, 1
warned, 1
the, 1
sentry, 1
of, 1
our, 1
coming.", 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men, 1
was, 1
Peppino,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
a, 1
bandit, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lookout., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
advanced,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
saluted, 1
them., 1
"Your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
follow, 1
me,, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
catacombs, 1
is, 1
close, 1
at, 1
hand.", 1
"Go, 1
on,, 1
then,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
They, 1
came, 1
to, 1
an, 1
opening, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
bushes, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pile, 1
of, 1
rocks,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
a, 1
man, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
pass., 1
Peppino, 1
glided, 1
first, 1
into, 1
this, 1
crevice;, 1
after, 1
they, 1
got, 1
along, 1
a, 1
few, 1
paces, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
widened., 1
Peppino, 1
passed,, 1
lighted, 1
his, 1
torch,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
they, 1
came, 1
after, 1
him., 1
The, 1
count, 1
first, 1
reached, 1
an, 1
open, 1
space, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
closely., 1
The, 1
passageway, 1
sloped, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gentle, 1
descent,, 1
enlarging, 1
as, 1
they, 1
proceeded;, 1
still, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
were, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
advance, 1
in, 1
a, 1
stooping, 1
posture,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
scarcely, 1
able, 1
to, 1
proceed, 1
abreast, 1
of, 1
one, 1
another., 1
They, 1
went, 1
on, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
were, 1
stopped, 1
by,, 1
"Who, 1
comes, 1
there?", 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
a, 1
torch, 1
on, 1
a, 1
carbine, 1
barrel., 1
"A, 1
friend!", 1
responded, 1
Peppino;, 1
and,, 1
advancing, 1
alone, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
sentry,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
to, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
saluted, 1
the, 1
nocturnal, 1
visitors,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
proceed., 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
sentinel, 1
was, 1
a, 1
staircase, 1
with, 1
twenty, 1
steps., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
descended, 1
these,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
a, 1
mortuary, 1
chamber., 1
Five, 1
corridors, 1
diverged, 1
like, 1
the, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
a, 1
star,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
walls,, 1
dug, 1
into, 1
niches,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
arranged, 1
one, 1
above, 1
the, 1
other, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shape, 1
of, 1
coffins,, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
last, 1
in, 1
the, 1
catacombs., 1
Down, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corridors,, 1
whose, 1
extent, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
determine,, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
light, 1
were, 1
visible., 1
The, 1
count, 1
laid, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
Franz's, 1
shoulder., 1
"Would, 1
you, 1
like, 1
to, 1
see, 1
a, 1
camp, 1
of, 1
bandits, 1
in, 1
repose?", 1
he, 1
inquired., 1
"Exceedingly,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"Come, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
then., 1
Peppino,, 1
put, 1
out, 1
the, 1
torch.", 1
Peppino, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
were, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
darkness,, 1
except, 1
that, 1
fifty, 1
paces, 1
in, 1
advance, 1
of, 1
them, 1
a, 1
reddish, 1
glare,, 1
more, 1
evident, 1
since, 1
Peppino, 1
had, 1
put, 1
out, 1
his, 1
torch,, 1
was, 1
visible, 1
along, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
They, 1
advanced, 1
silently,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
guiding, 1
Franz, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
faculty, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark., 1
Franz, 1
himself,, 1
however,, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
way, 1
more, 1
plainly, 1
in, 1
proportion, 1
as, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
which, 1
served, 1
in, 1
some, 1
manner, 1
as, 1
a, 1
guide., 1
Three, 1
arcades, 1
were, 1
before, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
one, 1
was, 1
used, 1
as, 1
a, 1
door., 1
These, 1
arcades, 1
opened, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side, 1
into, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
where, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
were,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
into, 1
a, 1
large, 1
square, 1
chamber,, 1
entirely, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
niches, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
those, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
spoken., 1
In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
this, 1
chamber, 1
were, 1
four, 1
stones,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
formerly, 1
served, 1
as, 1
an, 1
altar,, 1
as, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cross, 1
which, 1
still, 1
surmounted, 1
them., 1
A, 1
lamp,, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
base, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pillar,, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
with, 1
its, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
flickering, 1
flame, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
scene, 1
which, 1
presented, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
visitors, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow., 1
A, 1
man, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
with, 1
his, 1
elbow, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
the, 1
column,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
reading, 1
with, 1
his, 1
back, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
arcades,, 1
through, 1
the, 1
openings, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
new-comers, 1
contemplated, 1
him., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
band,, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa., 1
Around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
groups,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
their, 1
fancy,, 1
lying, 1
in, 1
their, 1
mantles,, 1
or, 1
with, 1
their, 1
backs, 1
against, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
stone, 1
bench,, 1
which, 1
went, 1
all, 1
round, 1
the, 1
columbarium,, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
twenty, 1
brigands, 1
or, 1
more,, 1
each, 1
having, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
within, 1
reach., 1
At, 1
the, 1
other, 1
end,, 1
silent,, 1
scarcely, 1
visible,, 1
and, 1
like, 1
a, 1
shadow,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
sentinel,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
walking, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
before, 1
a, 1
grotto,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
only, 1
distinguishable, 1
because, 1
in, 1
that, 1
spot, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
seemed, 1
more, 1
dense, 1
than, 1
elsewhere., 1
When, 1
the, 1
count, 1
thought, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
gazed, 1
sufficiently, 1
on, 1
this, 1
picturesque, 1
tableau,, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
to, 1
warn, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
silent,, 1
and,, 1
ascending, 1
the, 1
three, 1
steps, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
columbarium,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
by, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
arcade,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
Vampa,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
so, 1
intent, 1
on, 1
the, 1
book, 1
before, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
his, 1
footsteps., 1
"Who, 1
comes, 1
there?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
sentinel,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
less, 1
abstracted,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
saw, 1
by, 1
the, 1
lamp-light, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
approaching, 1
his, 1
chief., 1
At, 1
this, 1
challenge,, 1
Vampa, 1
rose, 1
quickly,, 1
drawing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
from, 1
his, 1
girdle., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
all, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
were, 1
on, 1
their, 1
feet,, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
carbines, 1
were, 1
levelled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
perfectly, 1
calm,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
muscle, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
disturbed,, 1
"well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Vampa,, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
you, 1
receive, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
with, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
ceremony.", 1
"Ground, 1
arms,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
imperative, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
he, 1
took, 1
off, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
respectfully;, 1
then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
personage, 1
who, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
this, 1
scene,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Your, 1
pardon,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
so, 1
far, 1
from, 1
expecting, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
visit,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
really, 1
recognize, 1
you.", 1
"It, 1
seems, 1
that, 1
your, 1
memory, 1
is, 1
equally, 1
short, 1
in, 1
everything,, 1
Vampa,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
not, 1
only, 1
do, 1
you, 1
forget, 1
people's, 1
faces,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
the, 1
conditions, 1
you, 1
make, 1
with, 1
them.", 1
"What, 1
conditions, 1
have, 1
I, 1
forgotten,, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
bandit,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
having, 1
committed, 1
an, 1
error,, 1
is, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
repair, 1
it., 1
"Was, 1
it, 1
not, 1
agreed,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"that, 1
not, 1
only, 1
my, 1
person,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
that, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friends,, 1
should, 1
be, 1
respected, 1
by, 1
you?", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
have, 1
I, 1
broken, 1
that, 1
treaty,, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
this, 1
evening, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
hither, 1
the, 1
Vicomte, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
Well,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
made, 1
Franz, 1
shudder,, 1
"this, 1
young, 1
gentleman, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friends--this, 1
young, 1
gentleman, 1
lodges, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hotel, 1
as, 1
myself--this, 1
young, 1
gentleman, 1
has, 1
been, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Corso, 1
for, 1
eight, 1
hours, 1
in, 1
my, 1
private, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
yet,, 1
I, 1
repeat, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
carried, 1
him, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
him, 1
hither,, 1
and,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
set, 1
a, 1
ransom, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
an, 1
utter, 1
stranger.", 1
"Why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
all, 1
this--you?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
brigand, 1
chief,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
all, 1
retreated, 1
before, 1
his, 1
look., 1
"Why, 1
have, 1
you, 1
caused, 1
me, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
fail, 1
in, 1
my, 1
word, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
like, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
all, 1
our, 1
lives, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands?, 1
By, 1
heavens,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
one, 1
of, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
gentleman, 1
was, 1
the, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
his, 1
excellency,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
blow, 1
his, 1
brains, 1
out, 1
with, 1
my, 1
own, 1
hand!", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
there, 1
was, 1
some, 1
mistake, 1
in, 1
this.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
alone?", 1
asked, 1
Vampa, 1
with, 1
uneasiness., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
with, 1
the, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
was, 1
addressed,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
that, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
his, 1
word., 1
Come,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
the, 1
count, 1
added,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Franz,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
himself, 1
express, 1
to, 1
you, 1
his, 1
deep, 1
regret, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mistake, 1
he, 1
has, 1
committed.", 1
Franz, 1
approached,, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
advancing, 1
several, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
"Welcome, 1
among, 1
us,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
"you, 1
heard, 1
what, 1
the, 1
count, 1
just, 1
said,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
my, 1
reply;, 1
let, 1
me, 1
add, 1
that, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
four, 1
thousand, 1
piastres, 1
at, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
fixed, 1
your, 1
friend's, 1
ransom,, 1
that, 1
this, 1
had, 1
happened.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
looking, 1
round, 1
him, 1
uneasily,, 1
"where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
Viscount?--I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
see, 1
him.", 1
"Nothing, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
I, 1
hope,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
frowningly., 1
"The, 1
prisoner, 1
is, 1
there,", 1
replied, 1
Vampa,, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hollow, 1
space, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
was, 1
on, 1
guard,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
he, 1
is, 1
free.", 1
The, 1
chief, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
place, 1
he, 1
had, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
as, 1
Albert's, 1
prison,, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
followed, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
doing?", 1
inquired, 1
Vampa, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sentinel., 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
captain,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
sentry,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
hour, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
stir.", 1
"Come, 1
in,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Vampa., 1
The, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
ascended, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
steps, 1
after, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
who, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
a, 1
bolt, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
door., 1
Then,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
gleam, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lamp,, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
which, 1
lighted, 1
the, 1
columbarium,, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
wrapped, 1
up, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cloak, 1
which, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
had, 1
lent, 1
him,, 1
lying, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
in, 1
profound, 1
slumber., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
smiling, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own, 1
peculiar, 1
smile,, 1
"not, 1
so, 1
bad, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
shot, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
to-morrow, 1
morning.", 1
Vampa, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
admiration;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
insensible, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
courage., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"this, 1
must, 1
be, 1
one, 1
of, 1
your, 1
friends.", 1
Then, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shoulder,, 1
saying,, 1
"Will, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
please, 1
to, 1
awaken?", 1
Albert, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
eyelids,, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
you,, 1
captain?, 1
You, 1
should, 1
have, 1
allowed, 1
me, 1
to, 1
sleep., 1
I, 1
had, 1
such, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
dream., 1
I, 1
was, 1
dancing, 1
the, 1
galop, 1
at, 1
Torlonia's, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
his, 1
watch, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
see, 1
how, 1
time, 1

"Half-past, 1
one, 1
only?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Why, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
do, 1
you, 1
rouse, 1
me, 1
at, 1
this, 1
hour?", 1
"To, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
free,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
ease, 1
of, 1
mind,, 1
"remember,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future,, 1
Napoleon's, 1
maxim,, 1
'Never, 1
awaken, 1
me, 1
but, 1
for, 1
bad, 1
news;', 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
let, 1
me, 1
sleep, 1
on,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
finished, 1
my, 1
galop,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
been, 1
grateful, 1
to, 1
you, 1
all, 1
my, 1
life., 1
So,, 1
then,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
paid, 1
my, 1
ransom?", 1
"No,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
how, 1
am, 1
I, 1
free?", 1
"A, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
can, 1
refuse, 1
nothing, 1
has, 1
come, 1
to, 1
demand, 1
you.", 1
"Come, 1
hither?", 1
"Yes,, 1
hither.", 1
"Really?, 1
Then, 1
that, 1
person, 1
is, 1
a, 1
most, 1
amiable, 1
person.", 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
and, 1
perceived, 1
Franz., 1
"What,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Franz,, 1
whose, 1
devotion, 1
and, 1
friendship, 1
are, 1
thus, 1
displayed?", 1
"No,, 1
not, 1
I,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"but, 1
our, 1
neighbor,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"Oh,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
gayly,, 1
arranging, 1
his, 1
cravat, 1
and, 1
wristbands,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
most, 1
kind,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
consider, 1
me, 1
as, 1
under, 1
eternal, 1
obligations, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place, 1
for, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
next, 1
for, 1
this, 1
visit,", 1
and, 1
he, 1
put, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count,, 1
who, 1
shuddered, 1
as, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
nevertheless, 1
did, 1
give, 1
it., 1
The, 1
bandit, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
this, 1
scene, 1
with, 1
amazement;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
prisoners, 1
tremble, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
here, 1
was, 1
one, 1
whose, 1
gay, 1
temperament, 1
was, 1
not, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
altered;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
Franz,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
enchanted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
way, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
sustained, 1
the, 1
national, 1
honor, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandit., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
make, 1
haste,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
yet, 1
have, 1
time, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
the, 1
night, 1
at, 1
Torlonia's., 1
You, 1
may, 1
conclude, 1
your, 1
interrupted, 1
galop,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
owe, 1
no, 1
ill-will, 1
to, 1
Signor, 1
Luigi,, 1
who, 1
has,, 1
indeed,, 1
throughout, 1
this, 1
whole, 1
affair, 1
acted, 1
like, 1
a, 1
gentleman.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
decidedly, 1
right,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
may, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
Palazzo, 1
by, 1
two, 1
o'clock., 1
Signor, 1
Luigi,", 1
continued, 1
Albert,, 1
"is, 1
there, 1
any, 1
formality, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
before, 1
I, 1
take, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
"None,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
bandit,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
as, 1
free, 1
as, 1
air.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
a, 1
happy, 1
and, 1
merry, 1
life, 1
to, 1
you., 1
Come,, 1
gentlemen,, 1
come.", 1
And, 1
Albert,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
square, 1
chamber,, 1
where, 1
stood, 1
all, 1
the, 1
bandits,, 1
hat, 1
in, 1
hand., 1
"Peppino,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigand, 1
chief,, 1
"give, 1
me, 1
the, 1
torch.", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
show, 1
you, 1
the, 1
way, 1
back, 1
myself,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain;, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
least, 1
honor, 1
that, 1
I, 1
can, 1
render, 1
to, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
And, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
lighted, 1
torch, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
herdsman,, 1
he, 1
preceded, 1
his, 1
guests,, 1
not, 1
as, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
who, 1
performs, 1
an, 1
act, 1
of, 1
civility,, 1
but, 1
like, 1
a, 1
king, 1
who, 1
precedes, 1
ambassadors., 1
On, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
he, 1
bowed., 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
my, 1
apologies,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
entertain, 1
any, 1
resentment, 1
at, 1
what, 1
has, 1
occurred.", 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Vampa,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"besides,, 1
you, 1
compensate, 1
for, 1
your, 1
mistakes, 1
in, 1
so, 1
gentlemanly, 1
a, 1
way,, 1
that, 1
one, 1
almost, 1
feels, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
you, 1
for, 1
having, 1
committed, 1
them.", 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
added, 1
the, 1
chief,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
"perhaps, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
may, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
very, 1
tempting, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
you, 1
should, 1
ever, 1
feel, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
me, 1
a, 1
second, 1
visit,, 1
wherever, 1
I, 1
may, 1
be,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
welcome.", 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
bowed., 1
The, 1
count, 1
went, 1
out, 1
first,, 1
then, 1
Albert., 1
Franz, 1
paused, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"Has, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
Vampa, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
have,", 1
replied, 1
Franz;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
curious, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
work, 1
you, 1
were, 1
perusing, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
attention, 1
as, 1
we, 1
entered.", 1
"Caesar's, 1
'Commentaries,'", 1
said, 1
the, 1
bandit,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
my, 1
favorite, 1
work.", 1
"Well,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
coming?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"here, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
and, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
left, 1
the, 1
caves., 1
They, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
plain., 1
"Ah,, 1
your, 1
pardon,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
turning, 1
round;, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
allow, 1
me,, 1
captain?", 1
And, 1
he, 1
lighted, 1
his, 1
cigar, 1
at, 1
Vampa's, 1
torch., 1
"Now,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
on, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
speed, 1
we, 1
may., 1
I, 1
am, 1
enormously, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
my, 1
night, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Duke, 1
of, 1
Bracciano's.", 1
They, 1
found, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
where, 1
they, 1
had, 1
left, 1
it., 1
The, 1
count, 1
said, 1
a, 1
word, 1
in, 1
Arabic, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
went, 1
on, 1
at, 1
great, 1
speed., 1
It, 1
was, 1
just, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1
by, 1
Albert's, 1
watch, 1
when, 1
the, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
entered, 1
into, 1
the, 1
dancing-room., 1
Their, 1
return, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
an, 1
event,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
they, 1
entered, 1
together,, 1
all, 1
uneasiness, 1
on, 1
Albert's, 1
account, 1
ceased, 1
instantly., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Viscount, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"yesterday, 1
you, 1
were, 1
so, 1
condescending, 1
as, 1
to, 1
promise, 1
me, 1
a, 1
galop;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
rather, 1
late, 1
in, 1
claiming, 1
this, 1
gracious, 1
promise,, 1
but, 1
here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
whose, 1
character, 1
for, 1
veracity, 1
you, 1
well, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
will, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
the, 1
delay, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
no, 1
fault, 1
of, 1
mine.", 1
And, 1
as, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
orchestra, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
for, 1
the, 1
waltz,, 1
Albert, 1
put, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
round, 1
the, 1
waist, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
and, 1
disappeared, 1
with, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
whirl, 1
of, 1
dancers., 1
In, 1
the, 1
meanwhile, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
considering, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
shudder, 1
that, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been,, 1
in, 1
some, 1
sort,, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
give, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Albert., 1
Chapter, 1
38., 1
The, 1
Compact., 1
The, 1
first, 1
words, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
uttered, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
morning,, 1
contained, 1
a, 1
request, 1
that, 1
Franz, 1
would, 1
accompany, 1
him, 1
on, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
true,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
warmly, 1
and, 1
energetically, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening;, 1
but, 1
services, 1
such, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
rendered, 1
could, 1
never, 1
be, 1
too, 1
often, 1
acknowledged., 1
Franz,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
some, 1
invisible, 1
influence, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
terror, 1
was, 1
strangely, 1
mingled,, 1
felt, 1
an, 1
extreme, 1
reluctance, 1
to, 1
permit, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
to, 1
be, 1
exposed, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
singular, 1
fascination, 1
that, 1
this, 1
mysterious, 1
personage, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
exercise, 1
over, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
made, 1
no, 1
objection, 1
to, 1
Albert's, 1
request,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
once, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
desired, 1
spot,, 1
and,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
short, 1
delay,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
joined, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
advancing, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him,, 1
"permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
thanks, 1

you, 1

for, 1

"My, 1
very, 1
good, 1
friend, 1

excellent, 1
neighbor,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"you, 1
really, 1
exaggerate, 1
my, 1
trifling, 1
exertions., 1

owe, 1
me, 1
nothing, 1

some, 1
trifle, 1
of, 1
20,000., 1
francs,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
saved, 1
out, 1
of, 1
your, 1
travelling, 1
expenses,, 1

that, 1
there, 1
is, 1
not, 1

me, 1
to, 1
congratulate, 1
you, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ease, 1
and, 1
unconcern, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
resigned, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
your, 1
fate,, 1

the, 1
perfect, 1
indifference, 1
you, 1
manifested, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
turn, 1
events, 1
might, 1
take.", 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
deserve, 1
no, 1
credit, 1
for, 1
what, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
help,, 1

a, 1
determination, 1
to, 1
take, 1
everything, 1

I, 1
found, 1
it,, 1

to, 1

of, 1

has, 1
nothing, 1

with, 1

I, 1
now, 1

it, 1
is, 1
made;--nay,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
still, 1
further,, 1
and, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
previously, 1
made, 1
up, 1
my, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
a, 1
great, 1
favor, 1
at, 1
your, 1
hands.", 1
"Oh,, 1
pray, 1
name, 1
it.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
wholly, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
Paris--it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
city, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
yet, 1
seen.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
reached, 1
your, 1
present, 1
age, 1
without, 1
visiting, 1
the, 1
finest, 1
capital, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world?, 1
I, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
credit, 1
it.", 1
"Nevertheless,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
true;, 1
still,, 1
I, 1
agree, 1
with, 1
you, 1
in, 1
thinking, 1
that, 1
my, 1
present, 1
ignorance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
city, 1
in, 1
Europe, 1
is, 1
a, 1
reproach, 1
to, 1
me, 1
in, 1
every, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
calls, 1
for, 1
immediate, 1
correction;, 1
but,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
performed, 1
so, 1
important,, 1
so, 1
necessary, 1
a, 1
duty,, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
making, 1
myself, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
wonders, 1
and, 1
beauties, 1
of, 1
your, 1
justly, 1
celebrated, 1
capital,, 1
had, 1
I, 1
known, 1
any, 1
person, 1
who, 1
would, 1
have, 1
introduced, 1
me, 1
into, 1
the, 1
fashionable, 1
world,, 1
but, 1
unfortunately, 1
I, 1
possessed, 1
no, 1
acquaintance, 1
there,, 1
and,, 1
of, 1
necessity,, 1
was, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
abandon, 1
the, 1
idea.", 1
"So, 1
distinguished, 1
an, 1
individual, 1
as, 1
yourself,", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
"could, 1
scarcely, 1
have, 1
required, 1
an, 1
introduction.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
most, 1
kind;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
regards, 1
myself,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
find, 1
no, 1
merit, 1
I, 1
possess,, 1
save, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
millionaire,, 1
I, 1
might, 1
have, 1
become, 1
a, 1
partner, 1
in, 1
the, 1
speculations, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Aguado, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Rothschild;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
my, 1
motive, 1
in, 1
travelling, 1
to, 1
your, 1
capital, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
for, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
dabbling, 1
in, 1
stocks,, 1
I, 1
stayed, 1
away, 1
till, 1
some, 1
favorable, 1
chance, 1
should, 1
present, 1
itself, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
my, 1
wish, 1
into, 1
execution., 1
Your, 1
offer,, 1
however,, 1
smooths, 1
all, 1
difficulties,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
only, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf", 1
(these, 1
words, 1
were, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
most, 1
peculiar, 1
smile),, 1
"whether, 1
you, 1
undertake,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
arrival, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
to, 1
open, 1
to, 1
me, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
that, 1

I, 1
know, 1
no, 1
more, 1

a, 1
Huron, 1

a, 1
native, 1
of, 1
Cochin-China?", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
do,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
infinite, 1
pleasure,", 1
answered, 1
Albert;, 1
"and, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
more, 1
readily, 1
as, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
received, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
from, 1
my, 1
father, 1
summons, 1
me, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
of, 1
a, 1
treaty, 1
of, 1
marriage, 1
(my, 1
dear, 1
Franz,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
smile,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you), 1
with, 1
a, 1
family, 1
of, 1
high, 1
standing,, 1
and, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
very, 1
cream, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
society.", 1
"Connected, 1
by, 1
marriage,, 1
you, 1
mean,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
laughingly., 1
"Well,, 1
never, 1
mind, 1
how, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
answered, 1
Albert,, 1
"it, 1
comes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
end., 1
Perhaps, 1
by, 1
the, 1
time, 1
you, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
sober,, 1
staid, 1
father, 1
of, 1
a, 1
family!, 1
A, 1
most, 1
edifying, 1
representative, 1

shall, 1
make, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
domestic, 1
virtues--don't, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?, 1
But, 1
as, 1
regards, 1
your, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
our, 1
fine, 1
city,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
only, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
command, 1
me, 1
and, 1
mine, 1
to, 1
any, 1
extent, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
"Then, 1
it, 1
is, 1
settled,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
my, 1
solemn, 1
assurance, 1
that, 1
I, 1
only, 1
waited, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
like, 1
the, 1
present, 1
to, 1
realize, 1
plans, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
long, 1
meditated.", 1
Franz, 1
did, 1
not, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
these, 1
plans, 1
were, 1
the, 1
same, 1
concerning, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
dropped, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
was, 1
speaking, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
closely,, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
read, 1
something, 1
of, 1
his, 1
purpose, 1
in, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
was, 1
inscrutable, 1
especially, 1
when,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
the, 1
present, 1
case,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
veiled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sphinx-like, 1
smile., 1
"But, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
now,, 1
count,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert,, 1
delighted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
having, 1
to, 1
chaperon, 1
so, 1
distinguished, 1
a, 1
person, 1
as, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
truly, 1
whether, 1
you, 1
are, 1
in, 1
earnest,, 1
or, 1
if, 1
this, 1
project, 1
of, 1
visiting, 1
Paris, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chimerical, 1
and, 1
uncertain, 1
air, 1
castles, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
make, 1
so, 1
many, 1
in, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
our, 1
lives,, 1

which,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
house, 1
built, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sand,, 1
is, 1
liable, 1
to, 1
be, 1

over, 1
by, 1
the, 1
first, 1
puff, 1
of, 1
wind?", 1
"I, 1

you, 1
my, 1
honor,", 1

the, 1

"When, 1
do, 1
you, 1
propose, 1
going, 1
thither?", 1

up, 1
your, 1
mind, 1

you, 1
shall, 1

"Certainly, 1
I, 1

in, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1

three, 1
weeks', 1
time,, 1

there!", 1
"Nay,", 1

the, 1
Count;, 1
"I, 1

you, 1

in, 1
three, 1
months', 1
time,", 1

Albert,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house?", 1

we, 1
make, 1
a, 1
positive, 1
appointment, 1
for, 1
a, 1

the, 1

me, 1

you, 1

"Day, 1
for, 1
day,, 1

Albert;, 1

will, 1
suit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
a, 1
dot.", 1
"So, 1
be, 1
it,, 1
then,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
calendar,, 1
suspended, 1
near, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"to-day, 1

out, 1

unconsciously, 1

shuddered, 1
at, 1
its, 1
touch,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
felt, 1
cold, 1

icy, 1
as, 1

of, 1
a, 1

"Let, 1
us, 1

particular, 1
against, 1
him?", 1
"Possibly.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
previously, 1
to, 1
coming, 1
hither?", 1
"I, 1
have.", 1
"And, 1
where?", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
promise, 1
me, 1
not, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
promise.", 1
"Upon, 1
your, 1
honor?", 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
honor.", 1
"Then, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Franz, 1
then, 1
related, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
his, 1
excursion, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
of, 1
his, 1
finding, 1
a, 1
party, 1
of, 1
smugglers, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits, 1
with, 1
them., 1
He, 1
dwelt, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
force, 1
and, 1
energy, 1
on, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
magical, 1
hospitality, 1
he, 1
had, 1
received, 1
from, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
magnificence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
entertainment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
of, 1
the, 1
"Thousand, 1
and, 1
One, 1
Nights.", 1
He, 1
recounted,, 1
with, 1
circumstantial, 1
exactitude,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
the, 1
supper,, 1
the, 1
hashish,, 1
the, 1
statues,, 1
the, 1
dream,, 1
and, 1
how,, 1
at, 1
his, 1
awakening,, 1
there, 1
remained, 1
no, 1
proof, 1
or, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
all, 1
these, 1
events,, 1
save, 1
the, 1
small, 1
yacht,, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distant, 1
horizon, 1
driving, 1
under, 1
full, 1
sail, 1
toward, 1
Porto-Vecchio., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
detailed, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
overheard, 1
by, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Colosseum,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Vampa,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
the, 1
release, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
Peppino,--an, 1
engagement, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
are, 1
aware,, 1
he, 1
most, 1
faithfully, 1
fulfilled., 1
At, 1
last, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
adventure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
embarrassment, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
placed, 1
by, 1
not, 1
having, 1
sufficient, 1
cash, 1
by, 1
six, 1
or, 1
seven, 1
hundred, 1
piastres, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
required,, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
of, 1
his, 1
application, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
the, 1
picturesque, 1
and, 1
satisfactory, 1
result, 1
that, 1
followed., 1
Albert, 1
listened, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
attention., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
when, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
concluded,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
find, 1
to, 1
object, 1
to, 1
in, 1
all, 1
you, 1
have, 1
related?, 1
The, 1
count, 1
is, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
travelling,, 1
and,, 1
being, 1
rich,, 1
possesses, 1
a, 1
vessel, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own., 1
Go, 1
but, 1
to, 1
Portsmouth, 1
or, 1
Southampton,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
the, 1
harbors, 1
crowded, 1
with, 1
the, 1
yachts, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
such, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English, 1
as, 1
can, 1
afford, 1
the, 1
expense,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
the, 1
same, 1
liking, 1
for, 1
this, 1
amusement., 1
Now,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
having, 1
a, 1
resting-place, 1
during, 1
his, 1
excursions,, 1
avoiding, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
cookery--which, 1
has, 1
been, 1
trying, 1
its, 1
best, 1
to, 1
poison, 1
me, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
months,, 1
while, 1
you, 1
have, 1
manfully, 1
resisted, 1
its, 1
effects, 1
for, 1
as, 1
many, 1
years,--and, 1
obtaining, 1
a, 1
bed, 1
on, 1
which, 1
it, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
slumber,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
has, 1
furnished, 1
for, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
temporary, 1
abode, 1
where, 1
you, 1
first, 1
found, 1
him;, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
possibility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Tuscan, 1
government, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
to, 1
his, 1
enchanted, 1
palace,, 1
and, 1
thereby, 1
depriving, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
advantages, 1
naturally, 1
expected, 1
from, 1
so, 1
large, 1
an, 1
outlay, 1
of, 1
capital,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
wisely, 1
enough, 1
purchased, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
and, 1
taken, 1
its, 1
name., 1
Just, 1
ask, 1
yourself,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1
whether, 1
there, 1
are, 1
not, 1
many, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
our, 1
acquaintance, 1
who, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
lands, 1
and, 1
properties, 1
they, 1
never, 1
in, 1
their, 1
lives, 1
were, 1
masters, 1
of?", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"the, 1
Corsican, 1
bandits, 1
that, 1
were, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vessel?", 1
"Why,, 1
really, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
simple, 1
enough., 1
Nobody, 1
knows, 1
better, 1
than, 1
yourself, 1
that, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
of, 1
Corsica, 1
are, 1
not, 1
rogues, 1
or, 1
thieves,, 1
but, 1
purely, 1
and, 1
simply, 1
fugitives,, 1
driven, 1
by, 1
some, 1
sinister, 1
motive, 1
from, 1
their, 1
native, 1
town, 1
or, 1
village,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
their, 1
fellowship, 1
involves, 1
no, 1
disgrace, 1
or, 1
stigma;, 1
for, 1
my, 1
own, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
protest, 1
that,, 1
should, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Corsica,, 1
my, 1
first, 1
visit,, 1
ere, 1
even, 1
I, 1
presented, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mayor, 1
or, 1
prefect,, 1
should, 1
be, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
of, 1
Colomba,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
could, 1
only, 1
manage, 1
to, 1
find, 1
them;, 1
for,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
conscience,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
a, 1
race, 1
of, 1
men, 1
I, 1
admire, 1
greatly.", 1
"Still,", 1
persisted, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
suppose, 1
you, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
that, 1
such, 1
men, 1
as, 1
Vampa, 1
and, 1
his, 1
band, 1
are, 1
regular, 1
villains,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
no, 1
other, 1
motive, 1
than, 1
plunder, 1
when, 1
they, 1
seize, 1
your, 1
person., 1
How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
explain, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
the, 1
count, 1
evidently, 1
possessed, 1
over, 1
those, 1
ruffians?", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
friend,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
I, 1
own, 1
my, 1
present, 1
safety, 1
to, 1
that, 1
influence,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
ill, 1
become, 1
me, 1
to, 1
search, 1
too, 1
closely, 1
into, 1
its, 1
source;, 1
therefore,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
condemning, 1
him, 1
for, 1
his, 1
intimacy, 1
with, 1
outlaws,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
give, 1
me, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1
any, 1
little, 1
irregularity, 1
there, 1
may, 1
be, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
connection;, 1
not, 1
altogether, 1
for, 1
preserving, 1
my, 1
life,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
own, 1
idea, 1
was, 1
that, 1
it, 1
never, 1
was, 1
in, 1
much, 1
danger,, 1
but, 1
certainly, 1
for, 1
saving, 1
me, 1
4,000, 1
piastres,, 1
which,, 1
being, 1
translated,, 1
means, 1
neither, 1
more, 1
nor, 1
less, 1
than, 1
24,000, 1
livres, 1
of, 1
our, 1
money--a, 1
sum, 1
at, 1
which,, 1
most, 1
assuredly,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
never, 1
have, 1
been, 1
estimated, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
proving, 1
most, 1
indisputably,", 1
added, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
a, 1
laugh,, 1
"that, 1
no, 1
prophet, 1
is, 1
honored, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
country.", 1
"Talking, 1
of, 1
countries,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"of, 1
what, 1
country, 1
is, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
his, 1
native, 1
tongue,, 1
whence, 1
does, 1
he, 1
derive, 1
his, 1
immense, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
were, 1
those, 1
events, 1
of, 1
his, 1
early, 1
life--a, 1
life, 1
as, 1
marvellous, 1
as, 1
unknown--that, 1
have, 1
tinctured, 1
his, 1
succeeding, 1
years, 1
with, 1
so, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
gloomy, 1
a, 1
misanthropy?, 1
Certainly, 1
these, 1
are, 1
questions, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
your, 1
place,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
have, 1
answered.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Franz,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"when,, 1
upon, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1
my, 1
letter,, 1
you, 1
found, 1
the, 1
necessity, 1
of, 1
asking, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
assistance,, 1
you, 1
promptly, 1
went, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
saying,, 1
'My, 1
friend, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
is, 1
in, 1
danger;, 1
help, 1
me, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
him.', 1
Was, 1
not, 1
that, 1
nearly, 1
what, 1
you, 1
said?", 1
"It, 1
was.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
did, 1
he, 1
ask, 1
you,, 1
'Who, 1
is, 1
M., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf?, 1
how, 1
does, 1
he, 1
come, 1
by, 1
his, 1
name--his, 1
fortune?, 1
what, 1
are, 1
his, 1
means, 1
of, 1
existence?, 1
what, 1
is, 1
his, 1
birthplace!, 1
of, 1
what, 1
country, 1
is, 1
he, 1
a, 1
native?', 1
Tell, 1
me,, 1
did, 1
he, 1
put, 1
all, 1
these, 1
questions, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
confess, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
none.", 1
"No;, 1
he, 1
merely, 1
came, 1
and, 1
freed, 1
me, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Vampa,, 1
where,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
my, 1
outward, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
ease, 1
and, 1
unconcern,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
very, 1
particularly, 1
care, 1
to, 1
remain., 1
Now,, 1
then,, 1
Franz,, 1
when,, 1
for, 1
services, 1
so, 1
promptly, 1
and, 1
unhesitatingly, 1
rendered,, 1
he, 1
but, 1
asks, 1
me, 1
in, 1
return, 1
to, 1
do, 1
for, 1
him, 1
what, 1
is, 1
done, 1
daily, 1
for, 1
any, 1
Russian, 1
prince, 1
or, 1
Italian, 1
nobleman, 1
who, 1
may, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
Paris--merely, 1
to, 1
introduce, 1
him, 1
into, 1
society--would, 1
you, 1
have, 1
me, 1
refuse?, 1
My, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
your, 1
senses, 1
to, 1
think, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
I, 1
could, 1
act, 1
with, 1
such, 1
cold-blooded, 1
policy.", 1
And, 1
this, 1
time, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
confessed, 1
that,, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
state, 1
of, 1
affairs, 1
in, 1
discussions, 1
between, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
the, 1
effective, 1
arguments, 1
were, 1
all, 1
on, 1
Albert's, 1
side., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
"do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
viscount,, 1

my, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
refutation., 1
Still,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
admit, 1
that, 1
this, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
a, 1
most, 1
singular, 1
personage.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
a, 1
philanthropist,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
other;, 1
"and, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
his, 1
motive, 1
in, 1
visiting, 1
Paris, 1

to, 1

for, 1

can, 1

will, 1
readily, 1
give, 1
him, 1

And, 1
now,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Franz,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
something, 1
else., 1
Come,, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
take, 1
our, 1
luncheon,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
pay, 1
a, 1
last, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
St., 1
Peter's?", 1
Franz, 1
silently, 1
assented;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
following, 1
afternoon,, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
five, 1
o'clock,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men, 1
parted., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
to, 1

to, 1
Paris,, 1

Franz, 1
d'Epinay, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1
at, 1
Venice., 1
But,, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
travelling, 1
carriage,, 1
Albert,, 1
fearing, 1
that, 1
his, 1
expected, 1
guest, 1
might, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
engagement, 1
he, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
into,, 1
placed, 1

Two, 1
windows, 1
only, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pavilion, 1
faced, 1
the, 1
street;, 1
three, 1
other, 1
windows, 1
looked, 1
into, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
at, 1
the, 1
back, 1
into, 1
the, 1

Between, 1
the, 1
court, 1
and, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
built, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heavy, 1
style, 1
of, 1
the, 1
imperial, 1
architecture,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
large, 1
and, 1
fashionable, 1
dwelling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
and, 1
Countess, 1
of, 1
Morcerf., 1
A, 1
high, 1
wall, 1
surrounded, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
surmounted, 1
at, 1
intervals, 1
by, 1
vases, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
flowers,, 1
and, 1
broken, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
by, 1
a, 1
large, 1
gate, 1
of, 1
gilded, 1
iron,, 1
which, 1
served, 1
as, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
entrance., 1
A, 1
small, 1
door,, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
lodge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
gave, 1
ingress, 1
and, 1
egress, 1
to, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
and, 1
masters, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
foot., 1
It, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
that, 1
the, 1
delicate, 1
care, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mother,, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
part, 1
from, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
viscount's, 1
age, 1
required, 1
the, 1
full, 1
exercise, 1
of, 1
his, 1
liberty,, 1
had, 1
chosen, 1
this, 1
habitation, 1
for, 1
Albert., 1
There, 1
were, 1
not, 1
lacking,, 1
however,, 1
evidences, 1
of, 1
what, 1
we, 1
may, 1
call, 1
the, 1
intelligent, 1
egoism, 1
of, 1
a, 1
youth, 1
who, 1
is, 1
charmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
indolent,, 1
careless, 1
life, 1
of, 1
an, 1
only, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
lives, 1
as, 1
it, 1
were, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gilded, 1
cage., 1
By, 1
means, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
windows, 1
looking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
Albert, 1
could, 1
see, 1
all, 1
that, 1
passed;, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
what, 1
is, 1
going, 1
on, 1
is, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
always, 1
want, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
world, 1
traverse, 1
their, 1
horizon,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
that, 1
horizon, 1
is, 1
only, 1
a, 1
public, 1
thoroughfare., 1
Then,, 1
should, 1
anything, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
merit, 1
a, 1
more, 1
minute, 1
examination,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
could, 1
follow, 1
up, 1
his, 1
researches, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
gate,, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
concierge's, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
merits, 1
a, 1
particular, 1
description., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
little, 1
entrance, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
never, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
opened, 1
since, 1
the, 1
house, 1
was, 1
built,, 1
so, 1
entirely, 1
was, 1
it, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
dust, 1
and, 1
dirt;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
well-oiled, 1
hinges, 1
and, 1
locks, 1
told, 1
quite, 1
another, 1
story., 1
This, 1
door, 1
was, 1
a, 1
mockery, 1
to, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
from, 1
whose, 1
vigilance, 1
and, 1
jurisdiction, 1
it, 1
was, 1
free,, 1
and,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
famous, 1
portal, 1
in, 1
the, 1
"Arabian, 1
Nights,", 1
opening, 1
at, 1
the, 1
"Sesame", 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Baba,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
wont, 1
to, 1
swing, 1
backward, 1
at, 1
a, 1
cabalistic, 1
word, 1
or, 1
a, 1
concerted, 1
tap, 1
from, 1
without, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sweetest, 1
voices, 1
or, 1
whitest, 1
fingers, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
long, 1
corridor,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
door, 1
communicated,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
was,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right,, 1
Albert's, 1
breakfast-room,, 1
looking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
looking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
Shrubs, 1
and, 1
creeping, 1
plants, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
hid, 1
from, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
and, 1
court, 1
these, 1
two, 1
apartments,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
rooms, 1
into, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground-floor,, 1
the, 1
prying, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
curious, 1
could, 1
penetrate., 1
On, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
above, 1
were, 1
similar, 1
rooms,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
addition, 1
of, 1
a, 1
third,, 1
formed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber;, 1
these, 1
three, 1
rooms, 1
were, 1
a, 1
salon,, 1
a, 1
boudoir,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bedroom., 1
The, 1
salon, 1
down-stairs, 1
was, 1
only, 1
an, 1
Algerian, 1
divan,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
smokers., 1
The, 1
boudoir, 1
up-stairs, 1
communicated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
bed-chamber, 1
by, 1
an, 1
invisible, 1
door, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
every, 1
precaution, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taken., 1
Above, 1
this, 1
floor, 1
was, 1
a, 1
large, 1
atelier,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
increased, 1
in, 1
size, 1
by, 1
pulling, 1
down, 1
the, 1
partitions--a, 1
pandemonium,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
artist, 1
and, 1
the, 1
dandy, 1
strove, 1
for, 1
preeminence., 1
There, 1
were, 1
collected, 1
and, 1
piled, 1
up, 1
all, 1
Albert's, 1
successive, 1
caprices,, 1
hunting-horns,, 1
bass-viols,, 1
flutes--a, 1
whole, 1
orchestra,, 1
for, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
had, 1
not, 1
a, 1
taste, 1
but, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
for, 1
music;, 1
easels,, 1
palettes,, 1
brushes,, 1
pencils--for, 1
music, 1
had, 1
been, 1
succeeded, 1
by, 1
painting;, 1
foils,, 1
boxing-gloves,, 1
broadswords,, 1
and, 1
single-sticks--for,, 1
following, 1
the, 1
example, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fashionable, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
time,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
cultivated,, 1
with, 1
far, 1
more, 1
perseverance, 1
than, 1
music, 1
and, 1
drawing,, 1
the, 1
three, 1
arts, 1
that, 1
complete, 1
a, 1
dandy's, 1
education,, 1
i.e.,, 1
fencing,, 1
boxing,, 1
and, 1
single-stick;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
here, 1
that, 1
he, 1
received, 1
Grisier,, 1
Cook,, 1
and, 1
Charles, 1
Leboucher., 1
The, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
furniture, 1
of, 1
this, 1
privileged, 1
apartment, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
old, 1
cabinets,, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
Chinese, 1
porcelain, 1
and, 1
Japanese, 1
vases,, 1
Lucca, 1
della, 1
Robbia, 1
faience,, 1
and, 1
Palissy, 1
platters;, 1
of, 1
old, 1
arm-chairs,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
perhaps, 1
had, 1
sat, 1
Henry, 1
IV., 1
or, 1
Sully,, 1
Louis, 1
XIII., 1
or, 1
Richelieu--for, 1
two, 1
of, 1
these, 1
arm-chairs,, 1
adorned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
carved, 1
shield,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
were, 1
engraved, 1
the, 1
fleur-de-lis, 1
of, 1
France, 1
on, 1
an, 1
azure, 1
field, 1
evidently, 1
came, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Louvre,, 1
or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
some, 1
royal, 1
residence., 1
Over, 1
these, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
sombre, 1
chairs, 1
were, 1
thrown, 1
splendid, 1
stuffs,, 1
dyed, 1
beneath, 1
Persia's, 1
sun,, 1
or, 1
woven, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fingers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
Calcutta, 1
or, 1
of, 1
Chandernagor., 1
What, 1
these, 1
stuffs, 1
did, 1
there,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
say;, 1
they, 1
awaited,, 1
while, 1
gratifying, 1
the, 1
eyes,, 1
a, 1
destination, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
their, 1
owner, 1
himself;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
meantime, 1
they, 1
filled, 1
the, 1
place, 1
with, 1
their, 1
golden, 1
and, 1
silky, 1
reflections., 1
In, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Roller, 1
and, 1
Blanchet, 1
"baby, 1
grand", 1
piano, 1
in, 1
rosewood,, 1
but, 1
holding, 1
the, 1
potentialities, 1
of, 1
an, 1
orchestra, 1
in, 1
its, 1
narrow, 1
and, 1
sonorous, 1
cavity,, 1
and, 1
groaning, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chefs-d'oeuvre, 1
of, 1
Beethoven,, 1
Weber,, 1
Mozart,, 1
Haydn,, 1
Gretry,, 1
and, 1
Porpora., 1
On, 1
the, 1
walls,, 1
over, 1
the, 1
doors,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ceiling,, 1
were, 1
swords,, 1
daggers,, 1
Malay, 1
creeses,, 1
maces,, 1
battle-axes;, 1
gilded,, 1
damasked,, 1
and, 1
inlaid, 1
suits, 1
of, 1
armor;, 1
dried, 1
plants,, 1
minerals,, 1
and, 1
stuffed, 1
birds,, 1
their, 1
flame-colored, 1
wings, 1
outspread, 1
in, 1
motionless, 1
flight,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
beaks, 1
forever, 1
open., 1
This, 1
was, 1
Albert's, 1
favorite, 1
lounging, 1
place., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
appointment,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
established, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
small, 1
salon, 1
down-stairs., 1
There,, 1
on, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
surrounded, 1
at, 1
some, 1
distance, 1
by, 1
a, 1
large, 1
and, 1
luxurious, 1
divan,, 1
every, 1
species, 1
of, 1
tobacco, 1
known,--from, 1
the, 1
yellow, 1
tobacco, 1
of, 1
Petersburg, 1
to, 1
the, 1
black, 1
of, 1
Sinai,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
on, 1
along, 1
the, 1
scale, 1
from, 1
Maryland, 1
and, 1
Porto-Rico,, 1
to, 1
Latakia,--was, 1
exposed, 1
in, 1
pots, 1
of, 1
crackled, 1
earthenware, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Dutch, 1
are, 1
so, 1
fond;, 1
beside, 1
them,, 1
in, 1
boxes, 1
of, 1
fragrant, 1
wood,, 1
were, 1
ranged,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
their, 1
size, 1
and, 1
quality,, 1
pueros,, 1
regalias,, 1
havanas,, 1
and, 1
manillas;, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
open, 1
cabinet,, 1
a, 1
collection, 1
of, 1
German, 1
pipes,, 1
of, 1
chibouques,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
amber, 1
mouth-pieces, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
coral,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
narghiles,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
tubes, 1
of, 1
morocco,, 1
awaiting, 1
the, 1
caprice, 1
or, 1
the, 1
sympathy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
smokers., 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
presided, 1
at, 1
the, 1
arrangement,, 1
or,, 1
rather,, 1
the, 1
symmetrical, 1
derangement,, 1
which,, 1
after, 1
coffee,, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
at, 1
a, 1
breakfast, 1
of, 1
modern, 1
days, 1
love, 1
to, 1
contemplate, 1
through, 1
the, 1
vapor, 1
that, 1
escapes, 1
from, 1
their, 1
mouths,, 1
and, 1
ascends, 1
in, 1
long, 1
and, 1
fanciful, 1
wreaths, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ceiling., 1
At, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
to, 1
ten,, 1
a, 1
valet, 1
entered;, 1
he, 1
composed,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
little, 1
groom, 1
named, 1
John,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
only, 1
spoke, 1
English,, 1
all, 1
Albert's, 1
establishment,, 1
although, 1
the, 1
cook, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
was, 1
always, 1
at, 1
his, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
great, 1
occasions, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
chasseur, 1
also., 1
This, 1
valet,, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
was, 1
Germain,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
enjoyed, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
confidence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
young, 1
master,, 1
held, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
papers,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
of, 1
letters,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
to, 1
Albert., 1
Albert, 1
glanced, 1
carelessly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
different, 1
missives,, 1
selected, 1
two, 1
written, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
and, 1
delicate, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
enclosed, 1
in, 1
scented, 1
envelopes,, 1
opened, 1
them, 1
and, 1
perused, 1
their, 1
contents, 1
with, 1
some, 1
attention., 1
"How, 1
did, 1
these, 1
letters, 1
come?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"One, 1
by, 1
the, 1
post,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
footman, 1
left, 1
the, 1
other.", 1
"Let, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
accept, 1
the, 1
place, 1
she, 1
offers, 1
me, 1
in, 1
her, 1
box., 1
Wait;, 1
then,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
tell, 1
Rosa, 1
that, 1
when, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
Opera, 1
I, 1
will, 1
sup, 1
with, 1
her, 1
as, 1

Take, 1
her, 1
six, 1
bottles, 1
of, 1
different, 1
wine--Cyprus,, 1
sherry,, 1
and, 1
Malaga,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
barrel, 1
of, 1
Ostend, 1
oysters;, 1
get, 1
them, 1
at, 1
Borel's,, 1

be, 1
sure, 1

they, 1
are, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"At, 1
what, 1
o'clock,, 1
sir,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
breakfast?", 1
"What, 1
time, 1
is, 1
it, 1
now?", 1
"A, 1
quarter, 1
to, 1
ten.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
at, 1
half, 1
past, 1
ten., 1
Debray, 1
will,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1

(Albert, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
tablets),, 1

that, 1

out, 1

French,, 1

The, 1
young, 1
officer, 1
bowed, 1
with, 1
easy, 1
and, 1
elegant, 1
politeness., 1
"Monsieur,", 1

Albert, 1
with, 1
affectionate, 1

"What, 1
has, 1
he, 1
done?", 1

Albert., 1
"Oh,, 1
nothing, 1
worth, 1
speaking, 1
of,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
exaggerates.", 1
"Not, 1
worth, 1
speaking, 1
of?", 1
cried, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"life, 1
is, 1
not, 1
worth, 1
speaking, 1
of!--that, 1
is, 1
rather, 1
too, 1
philosophical,, 1

my, 1
word,, 1
Morrel., 1

is, 1
very, 1
well, 1
for, 1
you,, 1

from, 1

"Exactly, 1
so.", 1
"On, 1
what, 1
occasion?", 1
asked, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Beauchamp,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1

our, 1
breakfast.", 1

Morcerf,, 1

one, 1
else.", 1
"Ah,, 1
true,, 1
a, 1
diplomatist!", 1
observed, 1
Debray., 1
"Diplomat, 1

not,, 1

don't, 1
know;, 1

only, 1
know, 1

himself, 1
on, 1

account, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mission,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
terminated, 1
so, 1
entirely, 1
to, 1
my, 1
satisfaction,, 1
that, 1
had, 1

been, 1

"Well,, 1

down, 1

Debray,, 1
"take, 1
a, 1
glass, 1

tell, 1
us, 1
all, 1
about, 1

"You, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
road, 1

traced, 1
for, 1

said, 1
Albert, 1
gallantly., 1
"Yes?, 1
but, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
your, 1
object, 1
was, 1

theirs--to, 1
rescue, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
Sepulchre.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
quite, 1
right,, 1
Beauchamp,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
aristocrat., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
only, 1
to, 1
fight, 1

duelling, 1

two, 1
seconds,, 1

had, 1
chosen, 1
to, 1

of, 1
my, 1
best, 1

know--poor, 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay.", 1
"Ah,, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"you, 1
did, 1
fight, 1
some, 1
time, 1
ago;, 1
about, 1
what?", 1
"The, 1
devil, 1
take, 1
me,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
remember,", 1
returned, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"But, 1
I, 1
recollect, 1
perfectly, 1
one, 1
thing,, 1

being, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
let, 1
such, 1
talents, 1
as, 1
mine, 1

new, 1
pistols, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
given, 1
to, 1

In, 1
consequence, 1
I, 1
embarked, 1
for, 1
Oran,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
from, 1
thence, 1
to, 1
Constantine,, 1
where, 1
I, 1
arrived, 1
just, 1
in, 1
time, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
raising, 1
of, 1

I, 1
retreated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
for, 1
eight, 1

forty, 1
hours., 1

endured, 1
the, 1
rain, 1

the, 1
day,, 1

the, 1
cold, 1

the, 1
night, 1
tolerably, 1

the, 1
third, 1

of, 1
cold., 1

up, 1

to, 1
have, 1

in, 1

"That's, 1
why, 1

to, 1

"You, 1
were, 1
very, 1

frightened,, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Well,, 1
yes,, 1

I, 1
had, 1
good, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so,", 1

Chateau-Renaud., 1

did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
in, 1

after, 1

had, 1
taken, 1
hashish,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
what, 1
he, 1
took, 1
for, 1

have, 1
been, 1
simply, 1
a, 1
row, 1
of, 1
statues.", 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Morcerf, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
say,--"Are, 1
you, 1
mad,, 1
or, 1
are, 1
you, 1
laughing, 1
at, 1
us?", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
also,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
thoughtfully,, 1
"have, 1
heard, 1
something, 1
like, 1
this, 1
from, 1
an, 1
old, 1
sailor, 1
named, 1
Penelon.", 1
"Ah,", 1
cried, 1
Albert,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
lucky, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
comes, 1
to, 1

vexed,, 1

clew, 1
to, 1

labyrinth?", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"what, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
is, 1
so, 1
extraordinary.", 1
"Ah,, 1
because, 1
your, 1
ambassadors, 1
and, 1
your, 1
consuls, 1
do, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
of, 1
them--they, 1
have, 1
no, 1
time., 1
They, 1
are, 1
too, 1
much, 1
taken, 1
up, 1
with, 1
interfering, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affairs, 1
of, 1
their, 1

travel.", 1
"Now, 1
you, 1
get, 1
angry,, 1

attack, 1

down, 1

Debray., 1
"Yes,", 1

Albert,, 1

Morcerf;, 1

"Rail, 1

rail, 1

Morcerf,, 1
somewhat, 1
piqued., 1

of, 1

race.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
highly, 1
flattered,", 1
returned, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,", 1

"There, 1
are, 1
no, 1
Italian, 1

Debray., 1
"No, 1

Beauchamp., 1
"No, 1

Beauchamp., 1
But, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
had, 1
not, 1
died, 1
away, 1
when, 1
Germain, 1
announced,, 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
The, 1
involuntary, 1
start, 1
every, 1
one, 1
gave, 1
proved, 1
how, 1
much, 1
Morcerf's, 1
narrative, 1
had, 1
impressed, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
himself, 1
could, 1
not, 1
wholly, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
manifesting, 1
sudden, 1
emotion., 1
He, 1
had, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
stop, 1
in, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
or, 1
steps, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber;, 1
the, 1
door, 1
had, 1
itself, 1
opened, 1
noiselessly., 1
The, 1
count, 1
appeared,, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
simplicity,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
most, 1
fastidious, 1
dandy, 1
could, 1
have, 1
found, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
cavil, 1
at, 1
in, 1
his, 1
toilet., 1
Every, 1
article, 1
of, 1
dress--hat,, 1
coat,, 1
gloves,, 1
and, 1
boots--was, 1
from, 1
the, 1
first, 1
makers., 1
He, 1
seemed, 1
scarcely, 1
five, 1
and, 1
thirty., 1
But, 1
what, 1
struck, 1
everybody, 1
was, 1
his, 1
extreme, 1
resemblance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
portrait, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
drawn., 1
The, 1
count, 1
advanced,, 1
smiling,, 1
into, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
hastened, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
holding, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
a, 1
ceremonial, 1
manner., 1
"Punctuality,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"is, 1

politeness, 1
of, 1

"My, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1

prohibited, 1

M., 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1

of, 1
Spahis.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
name, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
saluted, 1
every, 1
one, 1
with, 1
courtesy,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
with, 1
coldness, 1
and, 1
formality,, 1
stepped, 1
a, 1
pace, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
tinge, 1
of, 1
red, 1
colored, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
cheeks., 1
"You, 1

he;, 1

No, 1
one, 1
could, 1
have, 1
said, 1
what, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
voice, 1
to, 1
vibrate, 1
so, 1
deeply,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
made, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
flash,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
in, 1
general, 1
so, 1
clear,, 1
lustrous,, 1
and, 1
limpid, 1
when, 1
he, 1
pleased., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
our, 1
Africans,, 1
count?", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"Never,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
by, 1
this, 1
time, 1
perfectly, 1
master, 1
of, 1
himself, 1
again., 1
"Well,, 1
beneath, 1

"Oh,, 1

interrupted, 1
Morrel., 1
"Let, 1

At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
it, 1
was, 1
still, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
in, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
the, 1
concentrated, 1
look,, 1
changing, 1
color,, 1
and, 1
slight, 1
trembling, 1
of, 1
the, 1

a, 1
noble, 1

better.", 1
This, 1
exclamation,, 1
which, 1
corresponded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
own, 1
thought, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
to, 1
what, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
saying,, 1
surprised, 1
everybody,, 1
and, 1
especially, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1

with, 1
wonder., 1
But,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
intonation, 1
was, 1
so, 1
soft, 1
that,, 1
however, 1
strange, 1
the, 1
speech, 1
might, 1
seem,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
be, 1
offended, 1
at, 1
it., 1
"Why, 1
should, 1
he, 1
doubt, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
to, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"In, 1
reality,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
aristocratic, 1
glance, 1
and, 1
his, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
had, 1
penetrated, 1
at, 1
once, 1
all, 1

was, 1
penetrable, 1
in, 1

passed, 1
silently, 1
into, 1

every, 1

took, 1
his, 1

you,, 1

to, 1

anything, 1
in, 1

"With, 1

man.", 1
"A, 1

said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1

count, 1
was,, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be, 1
remembered,, 1
a, 1
most, 1
temperate, 1
guest., 1
Albert, 1
remarked, 1
this,, 1
expressing, 1
his, 1
fears, 1
lest,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
outset,, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
life, 1
should, 1
displease, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
essential, 1
point., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
fear, 1
one, 1
thing,, 1

me, 1

that, 1

Morcerf., 1
"No,, 1

slept,, 1

am, 1
weary, 1

you, 1

Morrel., 1
"Yes.", 1

have, 1
a, 1
recipe, 1
for, 1
it?", 1

infallible, 1
one.", 1
"That, 1
would, 1
be, 1
invaluable, 1

unfortunately,, 1
a, 1

excellent, 1
for, 1

be, 1

"May, 1
we, 1
inquire, 1
what, 1
is, 1
this, 1
recipe?", 1
asked, 1
Debray., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
make, 1
no, 1

of, 1

is, 1
a, 1
mixture, 1
of, 1
excellent, 1
opium,, 1

I, 1
fetched, 1
myself, 1
from, 1

"Yes,", 1

Morcerf,, 1
"he, 1
said, 1
something, 1
about, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
who,, 1
as, 1
became, 1
a, 1
journalist,, 1
was, 1
very, 1
incredulous,, 1
"you, 1
always, 1
carry, 1
this, 1
drug, 1
about, 1
you?", 1
"Always.", 1
"Would, 1
it, 1
be, 1
an, 1
indiscretion, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
to, 1

those, 1
precious, 1
pills?", 1
continued, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
take, 1
him, 1
at, 1
a, 1
disadvantage., 1
"No,, 1
monsieur,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
marvellous, 1
casket,, 1
formed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
a, 1
single, 1
emerald, 1
and, 1
closed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
golden, 1
lid, 1
which, 1
unscrewed, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
passage, 1
to, 1
a, 1
small, 1
greenish, 1
colored, 1
pellet, 1
about, 1
the, 1
size, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pea., 1
This, 1
ball, 1
had, 1
an, 1
acrid, 1
and, 1
penetrating, 1
odor., 1
There, 1
were, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
more, 1
in, 1
the, 1
emerald,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
contain, 1
about, 1
a, 1
dozen., 1
The, 1
casket, 1
passed, 1
around, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
more, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
admirable, 1
emerald, 1
than, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
pills, 1
that, 1
it, 1
passed, 1
from, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
hand., 1
"And, 1
is, 1
it, 1
your, 1
cook, 1
who, 1
prepares, 1
these, 1
pills?", 1
asked, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
thus, 1
betray, 1
my, 1
enjoyments, 1
to, 1

vulgar., 1

Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"although, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
has, 1
some, 1
remarkable, 1
family, 1
jewels.", 1
"I, 1
had, 1
three, 1
similar, 1
ones,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
gave, 1
one, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Sultan,, 1

sabre;, 1
another, 1
to, 1

his, 1
predecessor,, 1
Pius, 1
VII., 1

kept, 1
the, 1
third, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
it, 1
hollowed, 1
out,, 1
which, 1
reduced, 1
its, 1
value,, 1
but, 1
rendered, 1
it, 1
more, 1
commodious, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
I, 1
intended.", 1
Every, 1
one, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
astonishment;, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
simplicity, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
or, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
mad., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
emerald, 1
made, 1
them, 1
naturally, 1
incline, 1
to, 1
the, 1
former, 1
belief., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
these, 1
two, 1
sovereigns, 1
give, 1
you, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
for, 1
these, 1
magnificent, 1
presents?", 1
asked, 1
Debray., 1
"The, 1
Sultan,, 1
the, 1
liberty, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Count;, 1
"the, 1

Morcerf;, 1
"it, 1

him, 1
that, 1
you, 1
obtained, 1

"Perhaps,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1
smiling., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
count,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
idea, 1
what, 1
pleasure, 1
it, 1
gives, 1
me, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
thus,", 1

Morcerf., 1
"I, 1
had, 1
announced, 1
you, 1

of, 1

'Arabian, 1
Nights,', 1
a, 1

the, 1
Parisians, 1
are, 1
so, 1
subtle, 1
in, 1
paradoxes, 1
that, 1
they, 1
mistake, 1
for, 1

pronounced, 1
the, 1
two, 1

names,, 1
the, 1

glanced, 1
at, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel., 1
If, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
produce, 1
an, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
Morrel,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken--Maximilian, 1
started, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
electrified., 1
"Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this, 1
house,, 1

"They, 1
are, 1
my, 1
bankers, 1

returned, 1
the, 1
count, 1
quietly., 1
"Can, 1
my, 1
influence, 1
with, 1
them, 1
be, 1
of, 1
any, 1
service, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
count,, 1
you, 1
could, 1
assist, 1
me, 1
perhaps, 1
in, 1
researches, 1
which, 1
have, 1
been,, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
present,, 1
fruitless., 1

house,, 1
in, 1

has,, 1

"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
at, 1
your, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
bowing., 1
"But,", 1
continued, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"a, 1

of, 1
Danglars,--we, 1
have, 1
strangely, 1
wandered, 1

Debray,, 1

the, 1
young, 1

Rome, 1

fifty, 1
thousand, 1

that, 1
is, 1
really, 1
original,", 1

very, 1
princely,", 1

Chateau-Renaud., 1

was, 1
a, 1
comedy, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
playing,, 1

every, 1
word, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
had, 1
such, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
simplicity,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1

of, 1
me, 1

any, 1
one, 1
else;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
that, 1
reason,, 1
perhaps,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
me.", 1
They, 1
had, 1
long, 1
since, 1
passed, 1
to, 1
dessert, 1
and, 1
cigars., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
rising,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
half-past, 1
two., 1
Your, 1
guest, 1
is, 1
charming,, 1

you, 1

the, 1
best, 1
company, 1

go, 1
into, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
sometimes., 1
I, 1
must, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
minister's., 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1

shall, 1
soon, 1
know, 1
who, 1

"Take, 1
care,", 1
returned, 1
Albert;, 1
"no, 1
one, 1
has, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
accomplish, 1
that.", 1
"Oh,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
three, 1
millions, 1
for, 1
our, 1
police;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true, 1
they, 1
are, 1
almost, 1
always, 1
spent, 1
beforehand,, 1
but,, 1
no, 1
matter,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
still, 1
have, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
for, 1
this, 1
purpose.", 1
"And, 1
when, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
promise, 1
you., 1
Au, 1
revoir,, 1
Albert., 1
Gentlemen,, 1
good, 1
morning.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
Debray, 1
called, 1
out, 1
loudly,, 1
"My, 1
carriage.", 1
"Bravo,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
to, 1
Albert;, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chamber,, 1

I, 1
have, 1
something, 1
better, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
my, 1

a, 1
speech, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Danglars.", 1
"For, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
Beauchamp,", 1
returned, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
deprive, 1
me, 1
of, 1
the, 1
merit, 1
of, 1
introducing, 1
him, 1
everywhere., 1
Is, 1
he, 1
not, 1
peculiar?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
that,", 1
replied, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
extraordinary, 1

coming,, 1
Morrel?", 1
"Directly, 1

"Be, 1
sure, 1

shall, 1
not, 1
fail, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
bowing., 1
And, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1

41., 1
The, 1
Presentation., 1
When, 1
Albert, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
commence, 1
my, 1
services, 1

cicerone, 1
by, 1
showing, 1
you, 1
a, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1

who, 1
are, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1

palaces, 1
of, 1

amuse, 1
yourself, 1

from, 1

will, 1
open, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
already, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
breakfast-room, 1
and, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground-floor., 1
Albert, 1
led, 1
him, 1
first, 1
to, 1
his, 1
atelier,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
his, 1
favorite, 1
apartment., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
quickly, 1
appreciated, 1
all, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
collected, 1
here--old, 1
cabinets,, 1
Japanese, 1
porcelain,, 1
Oriental, 1
stuffs,, 1
Venetian, 1
glass,, 1
arms, 1
from, 1
all, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world--everything, 1
was, 1
familiar, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
glance, 1
he, 1
recognized, 1
their, 1
date,, 1
their, 1
country,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
origin., 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
expected, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
the, 1
guide;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
guidance,, 1
followed, 1
a, 1
course, 1
of, 1
archaeology,, 1
mineralogy,, 1
and, 1
natural, 1
history., 1
They, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
first, 1
floor;, 1
Albert, 1
led, 1
his, 1
guest, 1
into, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
The, 1
salon, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
works, 1
of, 1
modern, 1
artists;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
landscapes, 1
by, 1
Dupre,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
reeds, 1
and, 1
tall, 1
trees,, 1
their, 1
lowing, 1
oxen, 1
and, 1
marvellous, 1
skies;, 1
Delacroix's, 1
Arabian, 1
cavaliers,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
white, 1
burnouses,, 1
their, 1
shining, 1
belts,, 1
their, 1
damasked, 1
arms,, 1
their, 1
horses,, 1
who, 1
tore, 1
each, 1
other, 1
with, 1
their, 1
teeth, 1
while, 1
their, 1
riders, 1
contended, 1
fiercely, 1
with, 1
their, 1
maces;, 1
aquarelles, 1
of, 1
Boulanger,, 1
representing, 1
Notre, 1
Dame, 1
de, 1
Paris, 1

that, 1
vigor, 1
that, 1
makes, 1
the, 1
artist, 1
the, 1
rival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poet;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
paintings, 1
by, 1
Diaz,, 1
who, 1
makes, 1
his, 1
flowers, 1
more, 1
beautiful, 1
than, 1
flowers,, 1
his, 1
suns, 1
more, 1
brilliant, 1
than, 1
the, 1
sun;, 1
designs, 1
by, 1
Decamp,, 1
as, 1
vividly, 1
colored, 1
as, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Salvator, 1
Rosa,, 1
but, 1
more, 1
poetic;, 1
pastels, 1
by, 1
Giraud, 1
and, 1
Muller,, 1
representing, 1
children, 1
like, 1
angels, 1
and, 1
women, 1
with, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
a, 1

from, 1
the, 1
album, 1
of, 1
Dauzats', 1
"Travels, 1
in, 1

East,", 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
seconds, 1
on, 1
the, 1
saddle, 1
of, 1
a, 1
camel,, 1
or, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
dome, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mosque--in, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
all, 1
that, 1
modern, 1
art, 1
can, 1
give, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
and, 1
as, 1
recompense, 1
for, 1
the, 1
art, 1
lost, 1
and, 1
gone, 1
with, 1
ages, 1
long, 1
since, 1
past., 1
Albert, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
have, 1
something, 1
new, 1
this, 1
time, 1
to, 1
show, 1
to, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
great, 1
surprise,, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
without, 1
seeking, 1
for, 1
the, 1
signatures,, 1
many, 1
of, 1
which,, 1
indeed,, 1
were, 1
only, 1
initials,, 1
named, 1
instantly, 1
the, 1
author, 1
of, 1
every, 1
picture, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
each, 1
name, 1
was, 1
not, 1
only, 1
known, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
each, 1
style, 1
associated, 1
with, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
appreciated, 1
and, 1
studied, 1
by, 1
him., 1
From, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
bed-chamber;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
model, 1
of, 1
taste, 1
and, 1
simple, 1
elegance., 1
A, 1
single, 1
portrait,, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
Leopold, 1
Robert,, 1
shone, 1
in, 1
its, 1
carved, 1
and, 1
gilded, 1
frame., 1
This, 1
portrait, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
attention,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
made, 1
three, 1
rapid, 1
steps, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
suddenly, 1
before, 1
it., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
portrait, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
and, 1
twenty,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
complexion,, 1
and, 1
light, 1
and, 1
lustrous, 1
eyes,, 1
veiled, 1
beneath, 1
long, 1
lashes., 1
She, 1
wore, 1
the, 1
picturesque, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Catalan, 1
fisherwomen,, 1
a, 1
red, 1
and, 1
black, 1
bodice,, 1
and, 1
golden, 1
pins, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hair., 1
She, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sea,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
form, 1
was, 1
outlined, 1
on, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
ocean, 1
and, 1
sky., 1
The, 1
light, 1
was, 1
so, 1
faint, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
did, 1
not, 1
perceive, 1
the, 1
pallor, 1
that, 1
spread, 1
itself, 1
over, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
visage,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
nervous, 1
heaving, 1
of, 1
his, 1
chest, 1
and, 1
shoulders., 1
Silence, 1
prevailed, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gazed, 1
intently, 1
on, 1
the, 1
picture., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
there, 1
a, 1
most, 1
charming, 1
mistress,, 1
viscount,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
a, 1
perfectly, 1
calm, 1
tone;, 1
"and, 1
this, 1
costume--a, 1
ball, 1
costume,, 1
doubtless--becomes, 1
her, 1
admirably.", 1
"Ah,, 1
monsieur,", 1
returned, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
never, 1
forgive, 1
you, 1
this, 1
mistake, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
another, 1
picture, 1
beside, 1
this., 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
my, 1
mother;, 1
she, 1
it, 1
is, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
see, 1
here., 1
She, 1
had, 1
her, 1
portrait, 1
painted, 1
thus, 1
six, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
years, 1
ago., 1
This, 1
costume, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
one,, 1
it, 1
appears,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
resemblance, 1
is, 1
so, 1
great, 1
that, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
still, 1
see, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
in, 1
1830., 1
The, 1
countess, 1
had, 1
this, 1
portrait, 1
painted, 1
during, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
absence., 1
She, 1
doubtless, 1
intended, 1
giving, 1
him, 1
an, 1
agreeable, 1
surprise;, 1
but,, 1
strange, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
this, 1
portrait, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
displease, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
the, 1
picture,, 1
which, 1
is,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
works, 1
of, 1
Leopold, 1
Robert,, 1
could, 1
not, 1
overcome, 1
his, 1
dislike, 1
to, 1
it., 1
It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
between, 1
ourselves,, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
assiduous, 1
peers, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Luxembourg,, 1
a, 1
general, 1
renowned, 1
for, 1
theory,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
most, 1
mediocre, 1
amateur, 1
of, 1
art., 1
It, 1
is, 1
different, 1
with, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
who, 1
paints, 1
exceedingly, 1
well,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
unwilling, 1
to, 1
part, 1
with, 1
so, 1
valuable, 1
a, 1
picture,, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
put, 1
here,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
less, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
displease, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
whose, 1
portrait,, 1
by, 1
Gros,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
also, 1
show, 1
you., 1
Excuse, 1
my, 1
talking, 1
of, 1
family, 1
matters,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
introducing, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
this, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
you, 1
making, 1
any, 1
allusions, 1
to, 1
this, 1
picture., 1
The, 1
picture, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
malign, 1
influence,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
rarely, 1
comes, 1
here, 1
without, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
rarely, 1
does, 1
she, 1
look, 1
at, 1
it, 1
without, 1
weeping., 1
This, 1
disagreement, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
that, 1
has, 1
ever, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
between, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
countess,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
still, 1
as, 1
much, 1
united,, 1
although, 1
married, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twenty, 1
years,, 1
as, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
day, 1
of, 1
their, 1
wedding.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
glanced, 1
rapidly, 1
at, 1
Albert,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
a, 1
hidden, 1
meaning, 1
in, 1
his, 1
words,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
uttered, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
simplicity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
all, 1
my, 1
treasures,, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1

put, 1
yourself, 1
still, 1
more, 1
at, 1
your, 1
ease,, 1

accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
he, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
wrote, 1
from, 1
Rome, 1
an, 1
account, 1
of, 1
the, 1
services, 1
you, 1
rendered, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
announced, 1
your, 1
promised, 1
visit,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
may, 1
say, 1
that, 1
both, 1
the, 1
count, 1

countess, 1
anxiously, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
in, 1
person., 1
You, 1
are, 1
somewhat, 1
blase, 1

Monte, 1

without, 1

any, 1
answer;, 1
he, 1
accepted, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
without, 1
enthusiasm, 1

without, 1

him, 1
with, 1

count., 1
When, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1

was, 1
visible, 1

said, 1
he., 1
"These, 1

your, 1

the, 1

Morcerf,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
simplicity, 1
of, 1
conviction., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
guessed, 1
rightly., 1

"Yes,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"these, 1
blazons, 1

all, 1
the, 1
armed, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
possible,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf;, 1
"my, 1
father, 1
has, 1
in, 1

"Well,, 1
then,, 1
your, 1

would, 1

well, 1

from, 1

"you, 1

noble, 1
Catalan.", 1
It, 1
would, 1
have, 1
required, 1
the, 1
penetration, 1
of, 1
Oedipus, 1

the, 1
Sphinx, 1
to, 1
have, 1
divined, 1
the, 1
irony, 1
the, 1
count, 1
concealed, 1
beneath, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
apparently, 1
uttered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
politeness., 1
Morcerf, 1
thanked, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
pushed, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
above, 1

were, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
opened, 1
into, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
In, 1
the, 1
most, 1
conspicuous, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
was, 1
another, 1
portrait., 1
It, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
from, 1
five, 1
to, 1
eight, 1
and, 1
thirty,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
uniform, 1
of, 1
a, 1
general, 1
officer,, 1
wearing, 1
the, 1
double, 1
epaulet, 1
of, 1
heavy, 1
bullion,, 1
that, 1
indicates, 1
superior, 1
rank,, 1
the, 1
ribbon, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor, 1
around, 1
his, 1
neck,, 1

showed, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
commander,, 1

on, 1
the, 1
right, 1
breast,, 1
the, 1
star, 1
of, 1
a, 1
grand, 1
officer, 1
of, 1
the, 1
order, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Saviour,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
cross, 1
of, 1
Charles, 1
III.,, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
the, 1
person, 1
represented, 1
by, 1
the, 1
picture, 1
had, 1
served, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wars, 1
of, 1
Greece, 1
and, 1
Spain,, 1
or,, 1
what, 1
was, 1
just, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing, 1
as, 1
regarded, 1
decorations,, 1
had, 1
fulfilled, 1
some, 1
diplomatic, 1
mission, 1
in, 1
the, 1
two, 1
countries., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
examining, 1
this, 1
portrait, 1
with, 1
no, 1
less, 1
care, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bestowed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
when, 1
another, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
in, 1
person., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
forty, 1
to, 1
forty-five, 1
years,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
at, 1
least, 1
fifty,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
black, 1
mustache, 1
and, 1
eyebrows, 1
contrasted, 1
strangely, 1
with, 1
his, 1
almost, 1
white, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
cut, 1
short,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
military, 1
fashion., 1
He, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
plain, 1
clothes,, 1
and, 1
wore, 1
at, 1
his, 1
button-hole, 1
the, 1
ribbons, 1
of, 1
the, 1
different, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
belonged., 1
He, 1
entered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
dignified, 1
step,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
little, 1
haste., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
advance, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
without, 1
making, 1
a, 1
single, 1
step., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
were, 1
rooted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Father,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
presenting, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
the, 1
generous, 1
friend, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
in, 1
the, 1
critical, 1
situation, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
most, 1
welcome,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
saluting, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"and, 1
monsieur, 1
has, 1
rendered, 1
our, 1
house,, 1
in, 1
preserving, 1
its, 1
only, 1
heir,, 1
a, 1
service, 1
which, 1
insures, 1
him, 1
our, 1
eternal, 1
gratitude.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
said, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
another, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
window., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
in, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
Morcerf, 1
offered, 1
him,, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
as, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
large, 1
velvet, 1
curtains,, 1
and, 1
read, 1
on, 1
the, 1
careworn, 1
and, 1
livid, 1
features, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
a, 1
whole, 1
history, 1
of, 1
secret, 1
griefs, 1
written, 1
in, 1
each, 1
wrinkle, 1
time, 1
had, 1
planted, 1
there., 1
"The, 1
countess,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"was, 1
at, 1
her, 1
toilet, 1
when, 1
she, 1
was, 1
informed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
she, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
receive., 1
She, 1
will,, 1
however,, 1
be, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
in, 1
ten, 1
minutes.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
great, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"to, 1
be, 1
thus,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
day, 1
of, 1
my, 1
arrival, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
brought, 1
in, 1
contact, 1
with, 1
a, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
merit, 1
equals, 1
his, 1
reputation,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
fortune, 1
has, 1
for, 1
once, 1
been, 1
equitable,, 1
but, 1
has, 1
she, 1
not, 1
still, 1
on, 1
the, 1
plains, 1
of, 1
Metidja,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mountains, 1
of, 1
Atlas,, 1
a, 1
marshal's, 1
staff, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,", 1
replied, 1
Morcerf,, 1
reddening, 1
slightly,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
left, 1
the, 1
service,, 1
monsieur., 1
Made, 1
a, 1
peer, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Restoration,, 1
I, 1
served, 1
through, 1
the, 1
first, 1
campaign, 1
under, 1
the, 1
orders, 1
of, 1
Marshal, 1
Bourmont., 1
I, 1
could,, 1
therefore,, 1
expect, 1
a, 1
higher, 1
rank,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
what, 1
might, 1
have, 1
happened, 1
had, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
branch, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
the, 1
throne?, 1
But, 1
the, 1
Revolution, 1
of, 1
July, 1
was,, 1
it, 1
seems,, 1
sufficiently, 1
glorious, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ungrateful,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
so, 1

know, 1
how, 1
to, 1
manoeuvre, 1
on, 1
the, 1
slippery, 1
grounds, 1
of, 1
the, 1

I, 1
have, 1
hung, 1
up, 1
my, 1
sword,, 1

cast, 1
myself, 1
into, 1

I, 1
have, 1

myself, 1
to, 1

During, 1
the, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
I, 1
served,, 1
I, 1
often, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1

"These, 1

used, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
give, 1
vent, 1
to, 1
such, 1
bursts, 1
of, 1
enthusiasm., 1
"Alas,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
doubtless, 1
to, 1
dispel, 1
the, 1
slight, 1
cloud, 1
that, 1
covered, 1
Morcerf's, 1
brow,, 1
"we, 1
do, 1
not, 1
act, 1
thus, 1
in, 1
Italy;, 1
we, 1
grow, 1
according, 1
to, 1
our, 1
race, 1
and, 1
our, 1
species,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
pursue, 1
the, 1
same, 1
lines,, 1
and, 1
often, 1
the, 1
same, 1
uselessness,, 1
all, 1
our, 1
lives.", 1
"But,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"for, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
your, 1
merit,, 1
Italy, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
country,, 1
and, 1
France, 1
opens, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
you;, 1
respond, 1
to, 1
her, 1
call., 1
France, 1
will, 1
not,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
always, 1
ungrateful., 1
She, 1
treats, 1
her, 1
children, 1
ill,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
always, 1
welcomes, 1
strangers.", 1
"Ah,, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
evident, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
he, 1
despises, 1
all, 1
honors,, 1
and, 1
contents, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
those, 1
written, 1
on, 1
his, 1
passport.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
the, 1
most, 1
just, 1
remark,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
"I, 1
ever, 1
heard, 1
made, 1
concerning, 1
myself.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
been, 1
free, 1
to, 1
choose, 1
your, 1
career,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
chosen, 1
the, 1
path, 1
strewed, 1
with, 1
flowers.", 1
"Precisely,, 1
monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
smiles, 1
that, 1
a, 1
painter, 1
could, 1
never, 1
represent, 1
or, 1
a, 1
physiologist, 1
analyze., 1
"If, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
fear, 1
to, 1
fatigue, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
general,, 1
evidently, 1
charmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
manners,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chamber;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
debate, 1
very, 1
curious, 1
to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
strangers, 1
to, 1
our, 1
modern, 1
senators.", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
most, 1
grateful,, 1
monsieur,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
at, 1
some, 1
future, 1
time,, 1
renew, 1
your, 1
offer,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
flattered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
being, 1
introduced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
therefore, 1
wait.", 1
"Ah,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
mother,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
viscount., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
hastily,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
at, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
that, 1
by, 1
which, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
motionless;, 1
when, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
she, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
her, 1
arm,, 1
which, 1
for, 1
some, 1
unknown, 1
reason, 1
had, 1
been, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gilded, 1
door-post., 1
She, 1
had, 1
been, 1
there, 1
some, 1
moments,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
last, 1
words, 1
of, 1
the, 1
visitor., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
who, 1
inclined, 1
herself, 1
without, 1
speaking., 1
"Ah,, 1
good, 1
heavens,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
ill,, 1
or, 1
is, 1
it, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
that, 1
affects, 1
you?", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
ill,, 1
mother?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
viscount,, 1
springing, 1
towards, 1
her., 1
She, 1
thanked, 1
them, 1
both, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"No,", 1
returned, 1
she,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
some, 1
emotion, 1
on, 1
seeing,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
without, 1
whose, 1
intervention, 1
we, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
in, 1
tears, 1
and, 1
desolation., 1
Monsieur,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
advancing, 1
with, 1
the, 1
majesty, 1
of, 1
a, 1
queen,, 1
"I, 1
owe, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
this, 1
I, 1
bless, 1
you., 1
Now,, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
for, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
you, 1
give, 1
me, 1
in, 1
thus, 1
affording, 1
me, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
thanking, 1
you, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
blessed, 1
you,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
my, 1
heart.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed, 1
again,, 1
but, 1
lower, 1
than, 1
before;, 1
He, 1
was, 1
even, 1
paler, 1
than, 1
Mercedes., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
yourself, 1
recompense, 1
too, 1
generously, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
action., 1
To, 1
save, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
to, 1
spare, 1
a, 1
father's, 1
feelings,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
mother's, 1
sensibility,, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
do, 1
a, 1
good, 1
action,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
deed, 1
of, 1
humanity.", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
uttered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
exquisite, 1
sweetness, 1
and, 1
politeness,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
replied., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
fortunate, 1
for, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
monsieur,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
found, 1
such, 1
a, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
God, 1
that, 1
things, 1
are, 1
thus.", 1
And, 1
Mercedes, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
fine, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
so, 1
fervent, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
gratitude,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
tears, 1
in, 1
them., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
approached, 1
her., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
made, 1
my, 1
excuses, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
for, 1
quitting, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
pray, 1
you, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so, 1
also., 1
The, 1
sitting, 1
commences, 1
at, 1
two;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
now, 1
three,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
speak.", 1
"Go,, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
monsieur, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
strive, 1
our, 1
best, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
your, 1
absence,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
feeling., 1
"Monsieur,", 1
continued, 1
she,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
do, 1
us, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
with, 1
us?", 1
"Believe, 1
me,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
most, 1
grateful, 1
for, 1
your, 1
kindness,, 1

I, 1
got, 1
out, 1
of, 1
my, 1
travelling, 1
carriage, 1
at, 1
your, 1
door, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ignorant, 1
how, 1
I, 1
am, 1
installed, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
scarcely, 1
know;, 1
this, 1
is, 1
but, 1
a, 1
trifling, 1
inquietude,, 1
I, 1
know,, 1
but, 1
one, 1
that, 1
may, 1
be, 1
appreciated.", 1
"We, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
another, 1
time,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
"you, 1
promise, 1
that?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
inclined, 1
himself, 1
without, 1
answering,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
gesture, 1
might, 1
pass, 1
for, 1
assent., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
detain, 1
you,, 1
monsieur,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
our, 1
gratitude, 1
become, 1
indiscreet, 1
or, 1
importunate.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Count,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
return, 1
your, 1
politeness, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
and, 1
place, 1
my, 1
coupe, 1
at, 1
your, 1
disposal, 1
until, 1
your, 1
own, 1
be, 1
ready.", 1
"A, 1
thousand, 1
thanks, 1
for, 1
your, 1
kindness,, 1
viscount,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio, 1
has, 1
suitably, 1
employed, 1
the, 1
four, 1
hours, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1

have, 1
given, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
of, 1
some, 1
sort, 1
ready, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
used, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
proceeding;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that,, 1
like, 1
Nero,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
the, 1
impossible,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
astonished, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
judge, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own, 1
eyes, 1
how, 1
far, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
orders, 1
had, 1
been, 1
executed,, 1
he, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
not, 1
deceived., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf's, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
a, 1
footman,, 1
the, 1
same, 1
who, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
card, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
announced, 1
his, 1
visit,, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
vestibule,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
traveller, 1
found, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
awaiting, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
coupe, 1
of, 1
Koller's, 1
building,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
horses, 1
and, 1
harness, 1
for, 1
which, 1
Drake, 1
had,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
lions, 1
of, 1
Paris,, 1
refused, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
day, 1
seven, 1
hundred, 1
guineas., 1
"Monsieur,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
can, 1
only, 1
show, 1
you, 1
a, 1
habitation, 1
fitted, 1
up, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hurry,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
a, 1
reputation, 1

up, 1

me,, 1
therefore,, 1
one, 1
more, 1

you;, 1

in, 1
my, 1
hospitality.", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
for, 1
a, 1
day,, 1
count,, 1

know, 1
what, 1
to, 1
anticipate;, 1
it, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
a, 1
house, 1

shall, 1
see,, 1

a, 1
palace., 1

have, 1
decidedly, 1
some, 1
genius, 1
at, 1
your, 1
control.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
spread, 1
that, 1
idea,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
putting, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
on, 1
the, 1
velvet-lined, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
his, 1
splendid, 1
carriage,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
worth, 1
something, 1
to, 1
me, 1
among, 1
the, 1
ladies.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
he, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
vehicle,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
so, 1
rapidly, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
failed, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
imperceptible, 1
movement, 1
which, 1
stirred, 1
the, 1
curtains, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
When, 1
Albert, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
boudoir, 1
reclining, 1
in, 1
a, 1
large, 1
velvet, 1
arm-chair,, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
room, 1
so, 1
obscure, 1
that, 1
only, 1
the, 1
shining, 1
spangle,, 1
fastened, 1
here, 1
and, 1
there, 1
to, 1
the, 1
drapery,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
angles, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gilded, 1
frames, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pictures,, 1
showed, 1
with, 1
some, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
brightness, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gloom., 1
Albert, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thin, 1
veil, 1
she, 1
had, 1
put, 1
on, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
fell, 1
over, 1
her, 1
features, 1
in, 1
misty, 1
folds,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
though, 1
her, 1
voice, 1
had, 1
altered., 1
He, 1
could, 1
distinguish, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
perfumes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
roses, 1
and, 1
heliotropes, 1
in, 1
the, 1
flower-stands,, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
and, 1
fragrant, 1
odor, 1
of, 1
volatile, 1
salts,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
noticed, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chased, 1
cups, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mantle-piece, 1
the, 1
countess's, 1
smelling-bottle,, 1
taken, 1
from, 1
its, 1
shagreen, 1
case,, 1
and, 1
exclaimed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
uneasiness,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
entered,--"My, 1
dear, 1
mother,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
ill, 1
during, 1
my, 1
absence?", 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
Albert,, 1

you, 1
know, 1
these, 1
roses,, 1
tuberoses,, 1
and, 1
orange-flowers, 1

out, 1
at, 1
first,, 1
before, 1

myself.", 1
"Did, 1
your, 1
father, 1

Mercedes, 1
eagerly., 1
"No,, 1
madame;, 1

do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
remember, 1
that, 1

spoke, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
remember,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
A, 1
servant, 1
entered,, 1
summoned, 1
by, 1
Albert's, 1
ring, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bell., 1
"Take, 1
these, 1
flowers, 1
into, 1

the, 1
viscount;, 1
"they, 1

The, 1
footman, 1
obeyed, 1
his, 1
orders., 1
A, 1
long, 1
pause, 1
ensued,, 1

lasted, 1
until, 1
all, 1

flowers, 1
were, 1
removed., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
this, 1
name, 1
of, 1

inquired, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
when, 1

servant, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
away, 1

"I, 1

moment;, 1

after, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
hesitation,, 1
she, 1

"Why,, 1
you, 1

just, 1

"Ah,, 1
what, 1

"You, 1
say"--, 1
"I, 1

the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1

"And, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
is, 1
the, 1

age?", 1
inquired, 1
Mercedes,, 1
evidently, 1
attaching, 1
great, 1
importance, 1

thirty-six,, 1

"So, 1
young,--it, 1
is, 1
impossible,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
replying, 1
at, 1
the, 1

time, 1
to, 1
what, 1
Albert, 1
said, 1

four, 1

premeditation,, 1
'at, 1
such, 1

by, 1

kept, 1

The, 1
countess, 1
bent, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
wave, 1
of, 1
bitter, 1
thoughts., 1
"And, 1
has, 1
this, 1
man, 1
displayed, 1
a, 1
friendship, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
Albert?", 1
she, 1
asked, 1
with, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
shudder., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1

so.", 1
"And--do--you--like--him?", 1
"Why,, 1

"Albert,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1

was, 1
altered, 1
by, 1
emotion,, 1

your, 1

fell, 1
into, 1
so, 1
deep, 1
a, 1
revery, 1
that, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
gradually, 1
closed., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
standing, 1
up, 1
before, 1
her,, 1
gazed, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
with, 1
that, 1
filial, 1
affection, 1
which, 1
is, 1
so, 1
tender, 1
and, 1
endearing, 1
with, 1
children, 1
whose, 1
mothers, 1
are, 1
still, 1
young, 1
and, 1
handsome., 1
Then,, 1
after, 1
seeing, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
hearing, 1
her, 1
breathe, 1
gently,, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
she, 1
had, 1
dropped, 1
asleep,, 1

left, 1

with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
precaution., 1
"This, 1
devil, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fellow,", 1
he, 1
muttered,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head;, 1

perforce,, 1
be, 1
remarkable.", 1
He, 1
went, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
stables,, 1
not, 1
without, 1
some, 1
slight, 1
annoyance,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
laid, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
on, 1

of, 1

the, 1

had, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house;, 1
it, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
him, 1
six, 1
minutes, 1
to, 1
perform, 1
the, 1
distance,, 1
but, 1
these, 1
six, 1
minutes, 1
were, 1
sufficient, 1
to, 1
induce, 1
twenty, 1
young, 1
men, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
equipage, 1

had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1

themselves,, 1
to, 1
put, 1
their, 1
horses, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gallop, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
rich, 1
foreigner, 1
who, 1
could, 1
afford, 1
to, 1
give, 1
20,000, 1
francs, 1
apiece, 1
for, 1
his, 1
horses., 1
The, 1
house, 1
Ali, 1
had, 1
chosen,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
as, 1
a, 1
town, 1
residence, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
as, 1
you, 1
ascend, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees., 1
A, 1
thick, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees, 1
and, 1
shrubs, 1
rose, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre,, 1
and, 1
masked, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
front;, 1
around, 1
this, 1
shrubbery, 1
two, 1
alleys,, 1
like, 1
two, 1
arms,, 1
extended, 1
right, 1
and, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
carriage-drive, 1
from, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
gates, 1
to, 1
a, 1
double, 1
portico,, 1
on, 1
every, 1
step, 1
of, 1
which, 1
stood, 1
a, 1
porcelain, 1
vase,, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
flowers., 1
This, 1
house,, 1
isolated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
had,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
main, 1
entrance,, 1
another, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Ponthieu., 1
Even, 1
before, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
had, 1
hailed, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
the, 1
massy, 1
gates, 1
rolled, 1
on, 1
their, 1
hinges--they, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
coming,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
Paris,, 1
as, 1
everywhere, 1
else,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
served, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rapidity, 1
of, 1
lightning., 1
The, 1
coachman, 1
entered, 1
and, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
half-circle, 1
without, 1
slackening, 1
his, 1
speed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gates, 1
were, 1
closed, 1
ere, 1
the, 1
wheels, 1
had, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
sound, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gravel., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
left, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
portico,, 1
two, 1
men, 1
presented, 1
themselves, 1
at, 1
the, 1
carriage-window;, 1
the, 1
one, 1
was, 1
Ali,, 1
who,, 1
smiling, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
sincere, 1
joy,, 1
seemed, 1
amply, 1
repaid, 1
by, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
look, 1
from, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
The, 1
other, 1
bowed, 1
respectfully,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
assist, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
descending., 1
"Thanks,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
springing, 1
lightly, 1
up, 1
the, 1
three, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
portico;, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
notary?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
small, 1
salon,, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"And, 1
the, 1
cards, 1
I, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
be, 1
engraved, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
done, 1
already., 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
best, 1
engraver, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Palais, 1
Royal,, 1
who, 1
did, 1
the, 1
plate, 1
in, 1
my, 1
presence., 1
The, 1
first, 1
card, 1
struck, 1
off, 1
was, 1
taken,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
your, 1
orders,, 1

excellency's, 1
bedroom.", 1
"Good;, 1
what, 1
o'clock, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"Four, 1
o'clock.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
cane,, 1
and, 1
gloves, 1
to, 1
the, 1
same, 1
French, 1
footman, 1
who, 1
had, 1
called, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf's,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
small, 1
salon,, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
who, 1
showed, 1
him, 1
the, 1
way., 1
"These, 1
are, 1
but, 1
indifferent, 1
marbles, 1
in, 1
this, 1
ante-chamber,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
all, 1
this, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
be, 1
taken, 1
away.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
bowed., 1
As, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
had, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
awaited, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
small, 1
salon., 1
He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
simple-looking, 1
lawyer's, 1
clerk,, 1
elevated, 1
to, 1
the, 1
extraordinary, 1
dignity, 1
of, 1
a, 1
provincial, 1
scrivener., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
empowered, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
the, 1
country, 1
house, 1
that, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
purchase,, 1
monsieur?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Yes,, 1
count,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
deed, 1
of, 1
sale, 1
ready?", 1
"Yes,, 1
count.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
brought, 1
it?", 1
"Here, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"Very, 1
well;, 1
and, 1
where, 1
is, 1
this, 1
house, 1
that, 1
I, 1
purchase?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
carelessly,, 1
addressing, 1
himself, 1
half, 1
to, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
half, 1
to, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
The, 1
steward, 1
made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
that, 1
signified,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know.", 1
The, 1
notary, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
astonishment., 1
"What!", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"does, 1
not, 1
the, 1
count, 1
know, 1
where, 1
the, 1
house, 1
he, 1
purchases, 1
is, 1
situated?", 1
"No,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"The, 1
count, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know?", 1
"How, 1
should, 1
I, 1
know?, 1
I, 1
have, 1
arrived, 1
from, 1
Cadiz, 1
this, 1
morning., 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
before, 1
been, 1
at, 1
Paris,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
I, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
even, 1
set, 1
my, 1
foot, 1
in, 1
France.", 1
"Ah,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
different;, 1
the, 1
house, 1
you, 1
purchase, 1
is, 1
at, 1
Auteuil.", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
Bertuccio, 1
turned, 1
pale., 1
"And, 1
where, 1
is, 1
Auteuil?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Close, 1
by, 1
here,, 1
monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
notary--"a, 1
little, 1
beyond, 1
Passy;, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
situation,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Bois, 1
de, 1
Boulogne.", 1
"So, 1
near, 1
as, 1
that?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
country., 1
What, 1
made, 1
you, 1
choose, 1
a, 1
house, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gates, 1
of, 1
Paris,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio?", 1
"I,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
with, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
expression., 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
did, 1
not, 1
charge, 1
me, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
this, 1
house., 1
If, 1
his, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
recollect--if, 1
he, 1
will, 1
think"--, 1
"Ah,, 1
true,", 1
observed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
recollect, 1
now., 1
I, 1
read, 1
the, 1
advertisement, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
papers,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
tempted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
false, 1
title,, 1
'a, 1
country, 1
house.'", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
too, 1
late,", 1
cried, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
eagerly;, 1
"and, 1
if, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
will, 1
intrust, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
commission,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
find, 1
you, 1
a, 1
better, 1
at, 1
Enghien,, 1
at, 1
Fontenay-aux-Roses,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
Bellevue.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
negligently;, 1
"since, 1
I, 1
have, 1
this,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
keep, 1
it.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
are, 1
quite, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
who, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
his, 1
fee., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
place,, 1
well, 1
supplied, 1
with, 1
spring-water, 1
and, 1
fine, 1
trees;, 1
a, 1
comfortable, 1
habitation,, 1
although, 1
abandoned, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time,, 1
without, 1
reckoning, 1
the, 1
furniture,, 1
which,, 1
although, 1
old,, 1
is, 1
yet, 1
valuable,, 1
now, 1
that, 1
old, 1
things, 1
are, 1
so, 1
much, 1
sought, 1
after., 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
the, 1
count, 1
has, 1
the, 1
tastes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day?", 1
"To, 1
be, 1
sure,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
convenient,, 1
then?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
more--it, 1
is, 1
magnificent.", 1
"Peste,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
such, 1
an, 1
opportunity,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"The, 1
deed,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
Mr., 1
Notary.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
signed, 1
it, 1
rapidly,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
first, 1
run, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
over, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
deed, 1
in, 1
which, 1
were, 1
specified, 1
the, 1
situation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
and, 1
the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
the, 1
proprietors., 1
"Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"give, 1
fifty-five, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
monsieur.", 1
The, 1
steward, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
a, 1
faltering, 1
step,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bundle, 1
of, 1
bank-notes,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
counted, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
never, 1
gives, 1
a, 1
receipt, 1
for, 1
money, 1
until, 1
after, 1
he, 1
is, 1
sure, 1
it, 1
is, 1
all, 1
there., 1
"And, 1
now,", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"are, 1
all, 1
the, 1
forms, 1
complied, 1
with?", 1
"All,, 1
sir.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
the, 1
keys?", 1
"They, 1
are, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
who, 1
takes, 1
care, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
but, 1
here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
order, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
him, 1
to, 1
install, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
his, 1
new, 1
possessions.", 1
"Very, 1
well;", 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
which, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
further, 1
need, 1
of, 1
you;, 1
you, 1
may, 1
go.", 1
"But,", 1
observed, 1
the, 1
honest, 1
notary,, 1
"the, 1
count, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
mistaken;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1
everything, 1
included.", 1
"And, 1
your, 1
fee?", 1
"Is, 1
included, 1
in, 1
this, 1
sum.", 1
"But, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
come, 1
from, 1
Auteuil, 1
here?", 1
"Yes,, 1
certainly.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
but, 1
fair, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
be, 1
paid, 1
for, 1
your, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
time, 1
and, 1
trouble,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
polite, 1
dismissal., 1
The, 1
notary, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room, 1
backwards,, 1
and, 1
bowing, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
met, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
client., 1
"See, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
out,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
Bertuccio., 1
And, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Scarcely, 1
was, 1
the, 1
count, 1
alone,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
book, 1
closed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
lock,, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
key, 1
which, 1
he, 1
wore, 1
round, 1
his, 1
neck,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
never, 1
left, 1
him., 1
After, 1
having, 1
sought, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes,, 1
he, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
a, 1
leaf, 1
which, 1
had, 1
several, 1
notes,, 1
and, 1
compared, 1
them, 1
with, 1
the, 1
deed, 1
of, 1
sale,, 1
which, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"'Auteuil,, 1

he;, 1

However,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
know, 1

Bertuccio!", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
striking, 1
a, 1
light, 1
hammer, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pliant, 1
handle, 1
on, 1
a, 1
small, 1
gong., 1
"Bertuccio!", 1
The, 1
steward, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Monsieur, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
never, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1

travelled, 1
in, 1

"You, 1
know, 1
the, 1
environs, 1
of, 1

then?", 1
"No,, 1
excellency,, 1
no,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
nervous, 1
trembling,, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
a, 1
connoisseur, 1
in, 1
all, 1
emotions,, 1
rightly, 1
attributed, 1
to, 1
great, 1
disquietude., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
unfortunate,", 1
returned, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
never, 1
visited, 1

"To, 1
Auteuil!", 1
cried, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
whose, 1
copper, 1
complexion, 1
became, 1
livid--"I, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Auteuil?", 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
there, 1
surprising, 1
in, 1
that?, 1
When, 1
I, 1
live, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
come, 1
there,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
my, 1
service.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
hung, 1
down, 1
his, 1
head, 1
before, 1
the, 1
imperious, 1
look, 1
of, 1
his, 1
master,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
motionless,, 1
without, 1
making, 1
any, 1
answer., 1
"Why,, 1
what, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
you?--are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
ring, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time, 1
for, 1
the, 1
carriage?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
Louis, 1
XIV., 1
pronounced, 1
the, 1
famous,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
almost, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
wait.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
made, 1
but, 1
one, 1
bound, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
and, 1
cried, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice--"His, 1
excellency's, 1
horses!", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
wrote, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
notes,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
sealed, 1
the, 1
last,, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
appeared., 1
"Your, 1
excellency's, 1
carriage, 1
is, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Well,, 1
take, 1
your, 1
hat, 1
and, 1
gloves,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
you,, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
cried, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"Certainly,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
give, 1
the, 1
orders,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
residing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
unexampled, 1
for, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
to, 1
dare, 1
to, 1
dispute, 1
an, 1
order, 1
of, 1
his,, 1
so, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
master,, 1
who, 1
got, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
follow,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
did,, 1
taking, 1
his, 1
place, 1
respectfully, 1
on, 1
the, 1
front, 1
seat., 1
Chapter, 1
43., 1
The, 1
House, 1
at, 1
Auteuil., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
noticed,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
that, 1
Bertuccio, 1
signed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
manner;, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cross, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air, 1
with, 1
his, 1
thumb,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
muttered, 1
a, 1
short, 1
prayer., 1
Any, 1
one, 1
but, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
exhaustless, 1
thirst, 1
for, 1
knowledge, 1
would, 1
have, 1
had, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
steward's, 1
extraordinary, 1
repugnance, 1
for, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
projected, 1
drive, 1
without, 1
the, 1
walls;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
was, 1
too, 1
curious, 1
to, 1
let, 1
Bertuccio, 1
off, 1
from, 1
this, 1
little, 1
journey., 1
In, 1
twenty, 1
minutes, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
Auteuil;, 1
the, 1
steward's, 1
emotion, 1
had, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
augment, 1
as, 1
they, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
village., 1
Bertuccio,, 1
crouched, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
began, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
with, 1
a, 1
feverish, 1
anxiety, 1
every, 1
house, 1
they, 1
passed., 1
"Tell, 1
them, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
at, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Fontaine,, 1

said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
this, 1
order., 1
Bertuccio's, 1
forehead, 1
was, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
perspiration;, 1
however,, 1
he, 1
obeyed,, 1
and,, 1
leaning, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
he, 1
cried, 1
to, 1
the, 1
coachman,--"Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Fontaine,, 1
No., 1
28.", 1
No., 1
28, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
extremity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
village;, 1
during, 1
the, 1
drive, 1
night, 1
had, 1
set, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
darkness, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
surroundings, 1
the, 1
artificial, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stage., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped,, 1
the, 1
footman, 1
sprang, 1
off, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1

not, 1

out,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio--you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1

in, 1

carriage,, 1
then?, 1
What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
this, 1
evening?", 1
Bertuccio, 1
sprang, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
shoulder, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who,, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
leaned, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
as, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
three, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Knock,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
announce, 1
me.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
knocked,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
appeared., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
your, 1
new, 1
master,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
footman., 1
And, 1
he, 1
held, 1
out, 1
to, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
the, 1
notary's, 1
order., 1
"The, 1
house, 1
is, 1
sold,, 1
then?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
concierge;, 1
"and, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
is, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
live, 1
here?", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
no, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
regret, 1
your, 1

"Oh,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
have, 1
much, 1

to, 1
regret, 1
him,, 1

he, 1
came, 1
here, 1

seldom;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
five, 1
years, 1
since, 1
he, 1
was, 1
here, 1
last,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
did, 1
well, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
did, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
in, 1
anything, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
your, 1
old, 1
master?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"The, 1
Marquis, 1
of, 1
Saint-Meran., 1
Ah,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
sold, 1

what, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
for, 1
it.", 1
"The, 1
Marquis, 1
of, 1

returned, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"The, 1
name, 1
is, 1
not, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
the, 1
Marquis, 1
of, 1
Saint-Meran!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
meditate., 1
"An, 1
old, 1
gentleman,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
"a, 1
stanch, 1
follower, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Bourbons;, 1

had, 1
an, 1
only, 1
daughter,, 1

who, 1
had, 1

king's, 1
attorney, 1
at, 1
Nimes,, 1
and, 1
afterwards, 1
at, 1
Versailles.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
who, 1
became, 1
whiter, 1
than, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
against, 1
which, 1
he, 1
leaned, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
falling., 1
"And, 1
is, 1
not, 1
this, 1
daughter, 1
dead?", 1
demanded, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
fancy, 1
I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
so.", 1
"Yes,, 1
monsieur,, 1
one, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
ago;, 1
and, 1
since, 1
then, 1
we, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
marquis, 1
three, 1
times.", 1
"Thanks,, 1
thanks,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
judging, 1
from, 1
the, 1
steward's, 1
utter, 1
prostration, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
stretch, 1
the, 1
cord, 1
further, 1
without, 1
danger, 1
of, 1
breaking, 1
it., 1
"Give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
light.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
accompany, 1
you,, 1
monsieur?", 1
"No,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
unnecessary;, 1
Bertuccio, 1
will, 1
show, 1
me, 1
a, 1
light.", 1
And, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
accompanied, 1
these, 1
words, 1
by, 1
the, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
two, 1
gold, 1
pieces,, 1
which, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
torrent, 1
of, 1
thanks, 1
and, 1
blessings, 1
from, 1
the, 1
concierge., 1
"Ah,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
vainly, 1
searched, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mantle-piece, 1
and, 1
the, 1
shelves,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
got, 1
any, 1
candles.", 1
"Take, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage-lamps,, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
show, 1
me, 1
the, 1
apartments.", 1
The, 1
steward, 1
obeyed, 1
in, 1
silence,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
that, 1
held, 1
the, 1
light, 1
trembled,, 1
how, 1
much, 1
it, 1
cost, 1
him, 1
to, 1
obey., 1
They, 1
went, 1
over, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
large, 1
ground-floor;, 1
a, 1
second, 1
floor, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
salon,, 1
a, 1
bathroom,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
bedrooms;, 1
near, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bedrooms, 1
they, 1
came, 1
to, 1
a, 1
winding, 1
staircase, 1
that, 1
led, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
"Ah,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
private, 1
staircase,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
convenient., 1
Light, 1
me,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,, 1
and, 1
go, 1
first;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
see, 1
where, 1
it, 1
leads, 1
to.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"it, 1
leads, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden.", 1
"And,, 1
pray,, 1
how, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that?", 1
"It, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
at, 1
least.", 1
"Well,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
that.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
sighed,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
on, 1
first;, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
did,, 1
indeed,, 1
lead, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
At, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
door, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
paused., 1
"Go, 1
on,, 1
Monsieur, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
But, 1
he, 1
who, 1
was, 1
addressed, 1
stood, 1
there,, 1
stupefied,, 1
bewildered,, 1
stunned;, 1
his, 1
haggard, 1
eyes, 1
glanced, 1
around,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
the, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
some, 1
terrible, 1
event,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
his, 1
clinched, 1
hands, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
shut, 1
out, 1
horrible, 1
recollections., 1
"Well,", 1
insisted, 1
the, 1
Count., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
setting, 1
down, 1
the, 1
lantern, 1
at, 1
the, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
interior, 1
wall., 1
"No,, 1
monsieur,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible;, 1
I, 1
can, 1
go, 1
no, 1
farther.", 1
"What, 1
does, 1
this, 1
mean?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
irresistible, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
see,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
"that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
natural;, 1
that,, 1

of, 1

assassination!", 1
"What,, 1
what!", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
stopping, 1
suddenly,, 1
"what, 1
words, 1
do, 1
you, 1
utter?, 1
Devil, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
Corsican, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are--always, 1
mysteries, 1

Come,, 1
take, 1
the, 1
lantern,, 1

us, 1
visit, 1

are, 1
not, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
ghosts, 1
with, 1
me,, 1

hope?", 1
Bertuccio, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
lantern,, 1
and, 1
obeyed., 1
The, 1
door,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
opened,, 1
disclosed, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
sky,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
strove, 1
vainly, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
through, 1
a, 1
sea, 1
of, 1
clouds, 1
that, 1
covered, 1
her, 1
with, 1
billows, 1
of, 1
vapor, 1
which, 1
she, 1
illumined, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
only, 1
to, 1
sink, 1
into, 1
obscurity., 1
The, 1
steward, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left., 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1

said, 1
Monte, 1

"What, 1

beautiful, 1

Bertuccio, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
but, 1
obeyed;, 1
however,, 1
he, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
left, 1
hand., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand;, 1
arrived, 1
near, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees,, 1
he, 1
stopped., 1

steward, 1
could, 1

"Where, 1
he, 1
fell.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Monsieur, 1
Bertuccio,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
laughing,, 1
"control, 1
yourself;, 1

there!", 1
"I, 1

coldly., 1
"If, 1

shall, 1

"Alas,, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
joining, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
excited, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
laughter,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
thoughts, 1
of, 1
a, 1
superior, 1
interest, 1
occupied, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
rendered, 1
him, 1
attentive, 1
to, 1
the, 1
least, 1
revelation, 1
of, 1
this, 1
timorous, 1
conscience., 1
"Alas,, 1
excellency,, 1
the, 1
evil, 1
has, 1
arrived!", 1
"M., 1
Bertuccio,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1

am, 1
very, 1
glad, 1
to, 1

you, 1
gesticulate,, 1
you, 1
wring, 1
your, 1
hands, 1

devil, 1

will, 1
not, 1
leave, 1

always, 1
brooding, 1
over, 1
some, 1
old, 1
history, 1
of, 1

overlooked, 1

Bertuccio, 1
clasped, 1

as,, 1
in, 1
all, 1

evolutions,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
the, 1
lantern,, 1
the, 1
light, 1
showed, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
altered, 1
countenance., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
examined, 1
him, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
look, 1
that,, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bent, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
execution, 1
of, 1
Andrea,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
made, 1
a, 1
shudder, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
veins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
steward,--"The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
then, 1
told, 1
me, 1
an, 1
untruth,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"when,, 1
after, 1
his, 1
journey, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
in, 1
1829,, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
you, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
recommendation,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
enumerated, 1
all, 1
your, 1
valuable, 1

shall, 1

Bertuccio,, 1
in, 1
despair., 1

thus, 1
agitated., 1

is, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
sign;, 1
a, 1
quiet, 1
conscience, 1

not, 1

your, 1

Bertuccio, 1
hesitatingly,, 1

he, 1
said, 1
you, 1
would, 1
make, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
steward,, 1

concluded, 1
you, 1
had, 1
stolen--that, 1
was, 1
all.", 1
"Oh,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
contempt., 1
"Or,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
Corsican,, 1
that, 1
you, 1

Bertuccio,, 1
casting, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
feet,, 1

was, 1
simply, 1
vengeance--nothing, 1
else.", 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
that,, 1

I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

what, 1
it, 1

that, 1
galvanizes, 1
you, 1
in, 1
this, 1
manner.", 1
"But,, 1
monsieur,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
natural,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"since, 1
it, 1
was, 1
in, 1
this, 1
house, 1
that, 1
my, 1
vengeance, 1
was, 1
accomplished.", 1
"What!, 1
my, 1
house?", 1
"Oh,, 1
your, 1

then?, 1

Marquis, 1
de, 1

you, 1

on, 1
him,, 1
monsieur;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
on, 1
another.", 1

strange,", 1

Cristo,, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
yield, 1
to, 1

reflections,, 1

yourself, 1

"Monsieur,", 1

the, 1
steward,, 1

am, 1
sure., 1
First,, 1
you, 1
purchase, 1
a, 1
house, 1
at, 1
Auteuil--this, 1
house, 1

the, 1
one, 1
where, 1
I, 1

committed, 1

buried, 1
his, 1
child., 1

is, 1
not, 1

chance,, 1

"Well,, 1
amiable, 1
Corsican,, 1

us, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
is, 1
providence., 1
I, 1
always, 1
suppose, 1
anything, 1
people, 1
please,, 1

besides,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
concede, 1
something, 1
to, 1
diseased, 1
minds., 1

collect, 1
yourself,, 1

tell, 1
me, 1

"I, 1
have, 1
related, 1
it, 1

once,, 1

that, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1

head,, 1

least,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
arrested., 1
I, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
myself,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
had, 1
my, 1
sister-in-law, 1
to, 1
protect, 1
and, 1
provide, 1
for., 1
For, 1
three, 1
months, 1
I, 1
watched, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
for, 1
three, 1
months, 1
he, 1
took, 1
not, 1
a, 1
step, 1
out-of-doors, 1
without, 1
my, 1
following, 1
him., 1
At, 1
length, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
he, 1
went, 1
mysteriously, 1
to, 1
Auteuil., 1
I, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
thither,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
house, 1
where, 1
we, 1
now, 1
are,, 1
only,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
entering, 1
by, 1
the, 1
great, 1
door, 1
that, 1
looks, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
he, 1
came, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
left, 1
the, 1
one, 1
or, 1
the, 1
other, 1
at, 1
the, 1
little, 1
inn,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
you, 1
see, 1
there.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
to, 1
show, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
discern, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
the, 1
door, 1
to, 1
which, 1
Bertuccio, 1
alluded., 1
"As, 1
I, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
at, 1
Versailles,, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Auteuil,, 1
and, 1
gained, 1
all, 1
the, 1
information, 1
I, 1
could., 1
If, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
surprise, 1
him,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
to, 1
lie, 1
in, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
him., 1
The, 1
house, 1
belonged,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
informed, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
Villefort's, 1
father-in-law., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
lived, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
this, 1
country, 1
house, 1
was, 1
useless, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
reported, 1
to, 1
be, 1
let, 1
to, 1
a, 1
young, 1
widow,, 1
known, 1
only, 1
by, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
'the, 1
baroness.', 1
"One, 1
evening,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
over, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
handsome, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
was, 1
walking, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
that, 1
garden,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
overlooked, 1
by, 1
any, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
guessed, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
awaiting, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
When, 1
she, 1
was, 1
sufficiently, 1
near, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
her, 1
features,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
she, 1
was, 1
from, 1
eighteen, 1
to, 1
nineteen,, 1
tall, 1
and, 1
very, 1
fair., 1
As, 1
she, 1
had, 1
a, 1
loose, 1
muslin, 1
dress, 1
on, 1
and, 1
as, 1
nothing, 1
concealed, 1
her, 1
figure,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
she, 1
would, 1
ere, 1
long, 1
become, 1
a, 1
mother., 1
A, 1
few, 1
moments, 1
after,, 1
the, 1
little, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
a, 1
man, 1
entered., 1
The, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
They, 1
threw, 1
themselves, 1
into, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
arms,, 1
embraced, 1
tenderly,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
together, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house., 1
The, 1
man, 1
was, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
I, 1
fully, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
when, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
traverse, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
alone.", 1
"And,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
know, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
this, 1
woman?", 1
"No,, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio;, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
it.", 1
"Go, 1
on.", 1
"That, 1
evening,", 1
continued, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"I, 1
could, 1
have, 1
killed, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
sufficiently, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
neighborhood,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
fearful, 1
of, 1
not, 1
killing, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spot,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
if, 1
his, 1
cries, 1
were, 1
overheard, 1
I, 1
might, 1
be, 1
taken;, 1
so, 1
I, 1
put, 1
it, 1
off, 1
until, 1
the, 1
next, 1
occasion,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
should, 1
escape, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
took, 1
a, 1
chamber, 1
looking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street, 1
bordered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
Three, 1
days, 1
after,, 1
about, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
on, 1
horseback, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
house, 1
at, 1
full, 1
gallop,, 1
and, 1
take, 1
the, 1
road, 1
to, 1
Sevres., 1
I, 1
concluded, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Versailles,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
deceived., 1
Three, 1
hours, 1
later,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
returned, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
dust,, 1
his, 1
errand, 1
was, 1
performed,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
minutes, 1
after,, 1
another, 1
man, 1
on, 1
foot,, 1
muffled, 1
in, 1
a, 1
mantle,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
little, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
after, 1
him., 1
I, 1
descended, 1
rapidly;, 1
although, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
Villefort's, 1
face,, 1
I, 1
recognized, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
beating, 1
of, 1
my, 1
heart., 1
I, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
a, 1
post, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
once, 1
before, 1
looked, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
This, 1
time, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
content, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
looking,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
took, 1
my, 1
knife, 1
out, 1
of, 1
my, 1
pocket,, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
the, 1
point, 1
was, 1
sharp,, 1
and, 1
sprang, 1
over, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
My, 1
first, 1
care, 1
was, 1
to, 1
run, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
key, 1
in, 1
it,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
precaution, 1
of, 1
turning, 1
it, 1
twice, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lock., 1
Nothing,, 1
then,, 1
preventing, 1
my, 1
escape, 1
by, 1
this, 1
means,, 1
I, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
grounds., 1
The, 1
garden, 1
was, 1
long, 1
and, 1
narrow;, 1
a, 1
stretch, 1
of, 1
smooth, 1
turf, 1
extended, 1
down, 1
the, 1
middle,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corners, 1
were, 1
clumps, 1
of, 1
trees, 1
with, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
massy, 1
foliage,, 1
that, 1
made, 1
a, 1
background, 1
for, 1
the, 1
shrubs, 1
and, 1
flowers., 1
In, 1
order, 1
to, 1
go, 1
from, 1
the, 1
door, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
or, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
would, 1
be, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
clumps, 1
of, 1
trees., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
September;, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
blew, 1
violently., 1
The, 1
faint, 1
glimpses, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
moon,, 1
hidden, 1
momentarily, 1
by, 1
masses, 1
of, 1
dark, 1
clouds, 1
that, 1
were, 1
sweeping, 1
across, 1
the, 1
sky,, 1
whitened, 1
the, 1
gravel, 1
walks, 1
that, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
but, 1
were, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
pierce, 1
the, 1
obscurity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
shrubberies,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
man, 1
could, 1
conceal, 1
himself, 1
without, 1
any, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
discovery., 1
I, 1
hid, 1
myself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
one, 1
nearest, 1
to, 1
the, 1
path, 1
Villefort, 1
must, 1
take,, 1
and, 1
scarcely, 1
was, 1
I, 1
there, 1
when,, 1
amidst, 1
the, 1
gusts, 1
of, 1
wind,, 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
groans;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
who, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
an, 1
assassination, 1
fancies, 1
that, 1
he, 1
hears, 1
low, 1
cries, 1
perpetually, 1
ringing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
passed, 1
thus,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
I, 1
imagined, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
moans, 1
repeatedly., 1
Midnight, 1
struck., 1
As, 1
the, 1
last, 1
stroke, 1
died, 1
away,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
light, 1
shine, 1
through, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
private, 1
staircase, 1
by, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
just, 1
descended., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
reappeared., 1
The, 1
terrible, 1
moment, 1
had, 1
come,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
had, 1
so, 1
long, 1
been, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
it, 1
that, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
did, 1
not, 1
fail, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least., 1
I, 1
drew, 1
my, 1
knife, 1
from, 1
my, 1
pocket, 1
again,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
strike., 1
The, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mantle, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
weapon, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
I, 1
was, 1
afraid,, 1
not, 1
of, 1
a, 1
struggle,, 1
but, 1
of, 1
a, 1
failure., 1
When, 1
he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
paces, 1
from, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
what, 1
I, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
a, 1
weapon, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
spade., 1
I, 1
was, 1
still, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
divine, 1
for, 1
what, 1
reason, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
this, 1
spade, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
stopped, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
thicket, 1
where, 1
I, 1
was,, 1
glanced, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
dig, 1
a, 1
hole, 1
in, 1
the, 1
earth., 1
I, 1
then, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
hiding, 1
something, 1
under, 1
his, 1
mantle,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
laid, 1
on, 1
the, 1
grass, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
dig, 1
more, 1
freely., 1
Then,, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
curiosity, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
hatred;, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
see, 1
what, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
remained, 1
motionless,, 1
holding, 1
my, 1
breath., 1
Then, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
crossed, 1
my, 1
mind,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
confirmed, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
lift, 1
from, 1
under, 1
his, 1
mantle, 1
a, 1
box,, 1
two, 1
feet, 1
long,, 1
and, 1
six, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
inches, 1
deep., 1
I, 1
let, 1
him, 1
place, 1
the, 1
box, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hole, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made,, 1
then,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
stamped, 1
with, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
all, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
his, 1
occupation,, 1
I, 1
rushed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
and, 1
plunged, 1
my, 1
knife, 1
into, 1
his, 1
breast,, 1
exclaiming,--'I, 1
am, 1
Giovanni, 1
Bertuccio;, 1
thy, 1
death, 1
for, 1
my, 1
brother's;, 1
thy, 1
treasure, 1
for, 1
his, 1
widow;, 1
thou, 1
seest, 1
that, 1
my, 1
vengeance, 1
is, 1
more, 1
complete, 1
than, 1
I, 1
had, 1
hoped.', 1
I, 1
know, 1
not, 1
if, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
these, 1
words;, 1
I, 1
think, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
without, 1
a, 1
cry., 1
I, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
blood, 1
gush, 1
over, 1
my, 1
face,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
intoxicated,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
delirious,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
refreshed,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
burning, 1
me., 1
In, 1
a, 1
second, 1
I, 1
had, 1
disinterred, 1
the, 1
box;, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
known, 1
I, 1
had, 1
done, 1
so,, 1
I, 1
filled, 1
up, 1
the, 1
hole,, 1
threw, 1
the, 1
spade, 1
over, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
rushed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
double-locked,, 1
carrying, 1
off, 1
the, 1
key.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
this, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
murder, 1
and, 1
robbery.", 1
"No,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
returned, 1
Bertuccio;, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
vendetta, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
restitution.", 1
"And, 1
was, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
a, 1
large, 1
one?", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
money.", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
recollect,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
say, 1
something, 1
of, 1
an, 1
infant?", 1
"Yes,, 1
excellency;, 1
I, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
river,, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bank,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
my, 1
knife, 1
forced, 1
open, 1
the, 1
lock, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box., 1
In, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
linen, 1
cloth, 1
was, 1
wrapped, 1
a, 1
new-born, 1
child., 1
Its, 1
purple, 1
visage,, 1
and, 1
its, 1
violet-colored, 1
hands, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
it, 1
had, 1
perished, 1
from, 1
suffocation,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
cold,, 1
I, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
water, 1
that, 1
ran, 1
at, 1
my, 1
feet., 1
After, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
pulsation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
assistant, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hospital, 1
at, 1
Bastia,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
what, 1
a, 1
doctor, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done--I, 1
inflated, 1
the, 1
lungs, 1
by, 1
blowing, 1
air, 1
into, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
it, 1
began, 1
to, 1
breathe,, 1
and, 1
cried, 1
feebly., 1
In, 1
my, 1
turn, 1
I, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy., 1
'God, 1
has, 1
not, 1
cursed, 1
me, 1
then,', 1
I, 1
cried,, 1
'since, 1
he, 1
permits, 1
me, 1
to, 1
save, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
a, 1
human, 1
creature,, 1
in, 1
exchange, 1
for, 1
the, 1
life, 1
I, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
away.'", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
the, 1
child?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
embarrassing, 1
load, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
escape.", 1
"I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
keeping, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
at, 1
Paris, 1
there, 1
was, 1
an, 1
asylum, 1
where, 1
they, 1
receive, 1
such, 1
creatures., 1
As, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
city, 1
gates, 1
I, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
found, 1
the, 1
child, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
inquired, 1
where, 1
the, 1
asylum, 1
was;, 1
the, 1
box, 1
confirmed, 1
my, 1
statement,, 1
the, 1
linen, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
the, 1
infant, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
wealthy, 1
parents,, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
was, 1
covered, 1
might, 1
have, 1
proceeded, 1
from, 1
the, 1
child, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
from, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else., 1
No, 1
objection, 1
was, 1
raised,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
the, 1
asylum,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
d'Enfer,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
of, 1
cutting, 1
the, 1
linen, 1
in, 1
two, 1
pieces,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
letters, 1
which, 1
marked, 1
it, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
piece, 1
wrapped, 1
around, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
other, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
my, 1
possession,, 1
I, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
and, 1
fled, 1
with, 1
all, 1
speed., 1
A, 1
fortnight, 1
after, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
Rogliano,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Assunta,--'Console, 1
thyself,, 1
sister;, 1
Israel, 1
is, 1
dead,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
is, 1
avenged.', 1
She, 1
demanded, 1
what, 1
I, 1
meant,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
had, 1
told, 1
her, 1
all,--'Giovanni,', 1
said, 1
she,, 1
'you, 1
should, 1
have, 1
brought, 1
this, 1
child, 1
with, 1
you;, 1
we, 1
would, 1
have, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
parents, 1
it, 1
has, 1
lost,, 1
have, 1
called, 1
it, 1
Benedetto,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
of, 1
this, 1
good, 1
action,, 1
God, 1
would, 1
have, 1
blessed, 1
us.', 1
In, 1
reply, 1
I, 1
gave, 1
her, 1
the, 1
half, 1
of, 1
the, 1
linen, 1
I, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
reclaim, 1
him, 1
if, 1
we, 1
became, 1
rich.", 1
"What, 1
letters, 1
were, 1
marked, 1
on, 1
the, 1
linen?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"An, 1
H, 1
and, 1
an, 1
N,, 1
surmounted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
baron's, 1
coronet.", 1
"By, 1
heaven,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,, 1

use, 1
of, 1
heraldic, 1
terms;, 1

excellency,, 1
where, 1
everything, 1

"Go, 1
on,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
curious, 1
to, 1

two, 1
things.", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
they,, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
"What, 1
became, 1
of, 1
this, 1
little, 1
boy?, 1
for, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1

boy,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio.", 1
"No, 1
excellency,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
recollect, 1
telling, 1
you, 1
that.", 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
did;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
mistaken.", 1
"No,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
not,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
a, 1
little, 1
boy., 1
But, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
know, 1
two, 1
things;, 1
what, 1
was, 1
the, 1
second?", 1
"The, 1
second, 1
was, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
were, 1
accused, 1
when, 1
you, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
confessor,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
came, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
you, 1
at, 1
your, 1
request, 1
in, 1
the, 1
prison, 1
at, 1
Nimes.", 1
"The, 1
story, 1
will, 1
be, 1
very, 1
long,, 1
excellency.", 1
"What, 1
matter?, 1
you, 1
know, 1
I, 1
take, 1
but, 1
little, 1
sleep,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
suppose, 1
you, 1
are, 1
very, 1
much, 1
inclined, 1
for, 1
it, 1
either.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
story., 1
"Partly, 1
to, 1
drown, 1
the, 1
recollections, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past, 1
that, 1
haunted, 1
me,, 1
partly, 1
to, 1
supply, 1
the, 1
wants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
widow,, 1
I, 1
eagerly, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
my, 1
trade, 1
of, 1
smuggler,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
become, 1
more, 1
easy, 1
since, 1
that, 1
relaxation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
laws, 1
which, 1
always, 1
follows, 1
a, 1
revolution., 1
The, 1
southern, 1
districts, 1
were, 1
ill-watched, 1
in, 1
particular,, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disturbances, 1
that, 1
were, 1
perpetually, 1
breaking, 1
out, 1
in, 1
Avignon,, 1
Nimes,, 1
or, 1
Uzes., 1
We, 1
profited, 1
by, 1
this, 1
respite, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
government, 1
to, 1
make, 1
friends, 1
everywhere., 1
Since, 1
my, 1
brother's, 1
assassination, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
of, 1
Nimes,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
never, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
town;, 1
the, 1
result, 1
was, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
were, 1
connected,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
we, 1
would, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
come, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
come, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
established, 1
a, 1
branch, 1
to, 1
his, 1
inn,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
from, 1
Bellegarde, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard., 1
We, 1
had, 1
thus,, 1
at, 1
Aigues-Mortes,, 1
Martigues,, 1
or, 1
Bouc,, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
places, 1
where, 1
we, 1
left, 1
our, 1
goods,, 1
and, 1
where,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
necessity,, 1
we, 1
concealed, 1
ourselves, 1
from, 1
the, 1
gendarmes, 1
and, 1
custom-house, 1
officers., 1
Smuggling, 1
is, 1
a, 1
profitable, 1
trade,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
vigor, 1
and, 1
intelligence, 1
is, 1
employed;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mountains,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
double, 1
motive, 1
for, 1
fearing, 1
the, 1
gendarmes, 1
and, 1
custom-house, 1
officers,, 1
as, 1
my, 1
appearance, 1
before, 1
the, 1
judges, 1
would, 1
cause, 1
an, 1
inquiry,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
inquiry, 1
always, 1
looks, 1
back, 1
into, 1
the, 1
past., 1
And, 1
in, 1
my, 1
past, 1
life, 1
they, 1
might, 1
find, 1
something, 1
far, 1
more, 1
grave, 1
than, 1
the, 1
selling, 1
of, 1
smuggled, 1
cigars,, 1
or, 1
barrels, 1
of, 1
brandy, 1
without, 1
a, 1
permit., 1
So,, 1
preferring, 1
death, 1
to, 1
capture,, 1
I, 1
accomplished, 1
the, 1
most, 1
astonishing, 1
deeds,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once,, 1
showed, 1
me, 1
that, 1
the, 1
too, 1
great, 1
care, 1
we, 1
take, 1
of, 1
our, 1
bodies, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
obstacle, 1
to, 1
the, 1
success, 1
of, 1
those, 1
projects, 1
which, 1
require, 1
rapid, 1
decision,, 1
and, 1
vigorous, 1
and, 1
determined, 1
execution., 1
In, 1
reality,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
once, 1
devoted, 1
your, 1
life, 1
to, 1
your, 1
enterprises,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
the, 1
equal, 1
of, 1
other, 1
men,, 1
or,, 1
rather,, 1
other, 1
men, 1
are, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
your, 1
equals,, 1
and, 1
whosoever, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
this, 1
resolution,, 1
feels, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
and, 1
resources, 1
doubled.", 1
"Philosophy,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,", 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
Count;, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
a, 1
little, 1
of, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
your, 1
life.", 1
"Oh,, 1
excellency!", 1
"No,, 1
no;, 1
but, 1
philosophy, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
ten, 1
at, 1
night, 1
is, 1
somewhat, 1
late;, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
other, 1
observation, 1
to, 1
make,, 1
for, 1
what, 1
you, 1
say, 1
is, 1
correct,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
can, 1
be, 1
said, 1
for, 1
all, 1
philosophy.", 1
"My, 1
journeys, 1
became, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
extensive, 1
and, 1
more, 1
productive., 1
Assunta, 1
took, 1
care, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
our, 1
little, 1
fortune, 1
increased., 1
One, 1
day, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
setting, 1
off, 1
on, 1
an, 1
expedition,, 1
'Go,', 1
said, 1
she;, 1
'at, 1
your, 1
return, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
a, 1
surprise.', 1
I, 1
questioned, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
vain;, 1
she, 1
would, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
departed., 1
Our, 1
expedition, 1
lasted, 1
nearly, 1
six, 1
weeks;, 1
we, 1
had, 1
been, 1
to, 1
Lucca, 1
to, 1
take, 1
in, 1
oil,, 1
to, 1
Leghorn, 1
for, 1
English, 1
cottons,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
ran, 1
our, 1
cargo, 1
without, 1
opposition,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
home, 1
full, 1
of, 1
joy., 1
When, 1
I, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
beheld, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
Assunta's, 1
chamber, 1
was, 1
a, 1
cradle, 1
that, 1
might, 1
be, 1
called, 1
sumptuous, 1
compared, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
furniture,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
it, 1
a, 1
baby, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
months, 1
old., 1
I, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy;, 1
the, 1
only, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1
I, 1
had, 1
known, 1
since, 1
the, 1
assassination, 1

the, 1
procureur, 1

caused, 1
by, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
abandoned, 1
this, 1
child., 1
For, 1
the, 1
assassination, 1
itself, 1
I, 1
had, 1
never, 1
felt, 1
any, 1
remorse., 1
Poor, 1
Assunta, 1
had, 1
guessed, 1
all., 1
She, 1
had, 1
profited, 1
by, 1
my, 1
absence,, 1
and, 1
furnished, 1
with, 1
the, 1
half, 1
of, 1
the, 1
linen,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
written, 1
down, 1
the, 1
day, 1
and, 1
hour, 1
at, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
deposited, 1
the, 1
child, 1
at, 1
the, 1
asylum,, 1
had, 1
set, 1
off, 1
for, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
reclaimed, 1
it., 1
No, 1
objection, 1
was, 1
raised,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
infant, 1
was, 1
given, 1
up, 1
to, 1
her., 1
Ah,, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
this, 1
poor, 1
creature, 1
sleeping, 1
peacefully, 1
in, 1
its, 1
cradle,, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
my, 1
eyes, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
tears., 1
'Ah,, 1
Assunta,', 1
cried, 1
I,, 1
'you, 1
are, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
woman,, 1
and, 1
heaven, 1
will, 1
bless, 1
you.'", 1
"This,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"is, 1
less, 1
correct, 1
than, 1
your, 1
philosophy,--it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
faith.", 1
"Alas,, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
right,", 1
replied, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"and, 1
God, 1
made, 1
this, 1
infant, 1
the, 1
instrument, 1
of, 1
our, 1
punishment., 1
Never, 1
did, 1
a, 1
perverse, 1
nature, 1
declare, 1
itself, 1
more, 1
prematurely,, 1

yet, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1

with, 1
large, 1
blue, 1
eyes,, 1
of, 1
that, 1
deep, 1
color, 1
that, 1
harmonizes, 1
so, 1
well, 1
with, 1
the, 1
blond, 1
complexion;, 1
only, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
too, 1
light,, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
face, 1
a, 1
most, 1
singular, 1
expression,, 1
and, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vivacity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
look,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
malice, 1
of, 1
his, 1
smile., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
proverb, 1
which, 1
says, 1
that, 1
'red, 1
is, 1
either, 1
altogether, 1
good, 1
or, 1
altogether, 1
bad.', 1
The, 1
proverb, 1
was, 1
but, 1
too, 1
correct, 1
as, 1
regarded, 1
Benedetto,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
in, 1
his, 1
infancy, 1
he, 1
manifested, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
disposition., 1
It, 1
is, 1
true, 1
that, 1
the, 1
indulgence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
foster-mother, 1
encouraged, 1
him., 1
This, 1
child,, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
sister, 1
would, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
town,, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
leagues, 1
off,, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
the, 1
earliest, 1
fruits, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1
tempting, 1
sweetmeats,, 1
preferred, 1
to, 1
Palma, 1
grapes, 1
or, 1
Genoese, 1
preserves,, 1
the, 1
chestnuts, 1
stolen, 1
from, 1
a, 1
neighbor's, 1
orchard,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
dried, 1
apples, 1
in, 1
his, 1
loft,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
could, 1
eat, 1
as, 1
well, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nuts, 1
and, 1
apples, 1
that, 1
grew, 1
in, 1
my, 1
garden., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
when, 1
Benedetto, 1
was, 1
about, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six,, 1
our, 1
neighbor, 1
Vasilio,, 1
who,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
custom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
country,, 1
never, 1
locked, 1
up, 1
his, 1
purse, 1
or, 1
his, 1
valuables--for,, 1
as, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
knows,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
no, 1
thieves, 1
in, 1
Corsica--complained, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
purse;, 1
we, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
mistake, 1
in, 1
counting, 1
his, 1
money,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
persisted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
accuracy, 1
of, 1
his, 1
statement., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
Benedetto,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
gone, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
since, 1
morning,, 1
to, 1
our, 1
great, 1
anxiety,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
return, 1
until, 1
late, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
dragging, 1
a, 1
monkey, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
said, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
chained, 1
to, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tree., 1
For, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
month, 1
past,, 1
the, 1
mischievous, 1
child,, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
what, 1
to, 1
wish, 1
for,, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
it, 1
into, 1
his, 1
head, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
monkey., 1
A, 1
boatman,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
Rogliano,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
several, 1
of, 1
these, 1
animals,, 1
whose, 1
tricks, 1
had, 1
greatly, 1
diverted, 1
him,, 1
had,, 1
doubtless,, 1
suggested, 1
this, 1
idea, 1
to, 1
him., 1
'Monkeys, 1
are, 1
not, 1
found, 1
in, 1
our, 1
woods, 1
chained, 1
to, 1
trees,', 1
said, 1
I;, 1
'confess, 1
how, 1
you, 1
obtained, 1
this, 1
animal.', 1
Benedetto, 1
maintained, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
of, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
said,, 1
and, 1
accompanied, 1
it, 1
with, 1
details, 1
that, 1
did, 1
more, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
his, 1
imagination, 1
than, 1
to, 1
his, 1
veracity., 1
I, 1
became, 1
angry;, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
laugh,, 1
I, 1
threatened, 1
to, 1
strike, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
made, 1
two, 1
steps, 1
backwards., 1
'You, 1
cannot, 1
beat, 1
me,', 1
said, 1
he;, 1
'you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
right,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
my, 1
father.', 1
"We, 1
never, 1
knew, 1
who, 1
had, 1
revealed, 1
this, 1
fatal, 1
secret,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
had, 1
so, 1
carefully, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
him;, 1
however,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
this, 1
answer,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
child's, 1
whole, 1
character, 1
revealed, 1
itself,, 1
that, 1
almost, 1
terrified, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
arm, 1
fell, 1
without, 1
touching, 1
him., 1
The, 1
boy, 1
triumphed,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
victory, 1
rendered, 1
him, 1
so, 1
audacious,, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
money, 1
of, 1
Assunta,, 1
whose, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
him, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
as, 1
he, 1
became, 1
more, 1
unworthy, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
was, 1
spent, 1
in, 1
caprices, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
how, 1
to, 1
contend, 1
against,, 1
and, 1
follies, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
prevent., 1
When, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
Rogliano, 1
everything, 1
went, 1
on, 1
properly,, 1
but, 1
no, 1
sooner, 1
was, 1
my, 1
back, 1
turned, 1
than, 1
Benedetto, 1
became, 1
master,, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
went, 1
ill., 1
When, 1
he, 1
was, 1
only, 1
eleven,, 1
he, 1
chose, 1
his, 1
companions, 1
from, 1
among, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
eighteen, 1
or, 1
twenty,, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
characters, 1
in, 1
Bastia,, 1
or,, 1
indeed,, 1
in, 1
Corsica,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
had, 1
already,, 1
for, 1
some, 1
mischievous, 1
pranks,, 1
been, 1
several, 1
times, 1
threatened, 1
with, 1
a, 1
prosecution., 1
I, 1
became, 1
alarmed,, 1
as, 1
any, 1
prosecution, 1
might, 1
be, 1
attended, 1
with, 1
serious, 1
consequences., 1
I, 1
was, 1
compelled,, 1
at, 1
this, 1
period,, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
Corsica, 1
on, 1
an, 1
important, 1
expedition;, 1
I, 1
reflected, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
hope, 1
of, 1
averting, 1
some, 1
impending, 1
misfortune,, 1
I, 1
resolved, 1
that, 1
Benedetto, 1
should, 1
accompany, 1
me., 1
I, 1
hoped, 1
that, 1
the, 1
active, 1
and, 1
laborious, 1
life, 1
of, 1
a, 1
smuggler,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
severe, 1
discipline, 1
on, 1
board,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
a, 1
salutary, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
his, 1
character,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
now, 1
well-nigh,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
quite,, 1
corrupt., 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
Benedetto, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
me,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
tempt, 1
him, 1
by, 1
all, 1
the, 1
promises, 1
most, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
dazzle, 1
the, 1
imagination, 1
of, 1
a, 1
child, 1
of, 1
twelve., 1
He, 1
heard, 1
me, 1
patiently,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
burst, 1
out, 1
laughing., 1
"'Are, 1
you, 1
mad,, 1
uncle?', 1
(he, 1
called, 1
me, 1
by, 1
this, 1
name, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
good, 1
humor);, 1
'do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
change, 1
the, 1
life, 1

lead, 1
for, 1
your, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
existence--my, 1
agreeable, 1
indolence, 1

the, 1
hard, 1
and, 1
precarious, 1
toil, 1

the, 1
scorching, 1
heat, 1

a, 1
volley, 1
of, 1
bullets,, 1
all, 1
to, 1
earn, 1
a, 1
paltry, 1
sum?, 1
Why,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
as, 1
much, 1
money, 1
as, 1
I, 1
want;, 1
mother, 1
Assunta, 1
always, 1
furnishes, 1
me, 1
when, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
it!, 1
You, 1
see, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
a, 1
fool, 1
to, 1
accept, 1
your, 1
offer.', 1
The, 1
arguments,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
audacity,, 1
perfectly, 1
stupefied, 1
me., 1
Benedetto, 1
rejoined, 1
his, 1
associates,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
from, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
point, 1
me, 1
out, 1
to, 1
them, 1
as, 1
a, 1
fool.", 1
"Sweet, 1
child,", 1
murmured, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Oh,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
been, 1
my, 1
own, 1
son,", 1
replied, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"or, 1
even, 1
my, 1
nephew,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
right, 1
road,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
doing, 1
your, 1
duty, 1
gives, 1
you, 1
strength,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
striking, 1
a, 1
child, 1
whose, 1
father, 1
I, 1
had, 1
killed,, 1
made, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
punish, 1
him., 1
I, 1
gave, 1
my, 1
sister,, 1
who, 1
constantly, 1
defended, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
boy,, 1
good, 1
advice,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
she, 1
confessed, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
several, 1
times, 1
missed, 1
money, 1
to, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
amount,, 1
I, 1
showed, 1
her, 1
a, 1
safe, 1
place, 1
in, 1
which, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
our, 1
little, 1
treasure, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future., 1
My, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
already, 1
made, 1
up., 1
Benedetto, 1
could, 1
read,, 1
write,, 1
and, 1
cipher, 1
perfectly,, 1
for, 1
when, 1
the, 1
fit, 1
seized, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
learned, 1
more, 1
in, 1
a, 1
day, 1
than, 1
others, 1
in, 1
a, 1
week., 1
My, 1
intention, 1
was, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
him, 1
as, 1
a, 1
clerk, 1
in, 1
some, 1
ship,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
letting, 1
him, 1
know, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
my, 1
plan,, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
him, 1
some, 1
morning, 1
on, 1
board;, 1
by, 1
this, 1
means, 1
his, 1
future, 1
treatment, 1
would, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
own, 1
conduct., 1
I, 1
set, 1
off, 1
for, 1
France,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
fixed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
plan., 1
Our, 1
cargo, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
landed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Gulf, 1
of, 1
Lyons,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
was, 1
a, 1
difficult, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
do, 1
because, 1
it, 1
was, 1
then, 1
the, 1
year, 1
1829., 1
The, 1
most, 1
perfect, 1
tranquillity, 1
was, 1
restored,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vigilance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
custom-house, 1
officers, 1
was, 1
redoubled,, 1
and, 1
their, 1
strictness, 1
was, 1
increased, 1
at, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
at, 1
Beaucaire., 1
"Our, 1
expedition, 1
made, 1
a, 1
favorable, 1
beginning., 1
We, 1
anchored, 1
our, 1
vessel--which, 1
had, 1
a, 1
double, 1
hold,, 1
where, 1
our, 1
goods, 1
were, 1
concealed--amidst, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
other, 1
vessels, 1
that, 1
bordered, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rhone, 1
from, 1
Beaucaire, 1
to, 1
Arles., 1
On, 1
our, 1
arrival, 1
we, 1
began, 1
to, 1
discharge, 1
our, 1
cargo, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
town,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
were, 1
connected., 1
Whether, 1
success, 1
rendered, 1
us, 1
imprudent,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
we, 1
were, 1
betrayed,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
not;, 1
but, 1
one, 1
evening,, 1
about, 1
five, 1
o'clock,, 1
our, 1
little, 1
cabin-boy, 1
came, 1
breathlessly,, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
us, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
a, 1
detachment, 1
of, 1
custom-house, 1
officers, 1
advancing, 1
in, 1
our, 1
direction., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
their, 1
proximity, 1
that, 1
alarmed, 1
us,, 1
for, 1
detachments, 1
were, 1
constantly, 1
patrolling, 1
along, 1
the, 1
banks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rhone,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
care,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
boy's, 1
account,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
took, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
being, 1
seen., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
we, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
alert,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
too, 1
late;, 1
our, 1
vessel, 1
was, 1
surrounded,, 1
and, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
custom-house, 1
officers, 1
I, 1
observed, 1
several, 1
gendarmes,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
terrified, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
their, 1
uniforms, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
brave, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
any, 1
other,, 1
I, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hold,, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
port,, 1
and, 1
dropped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
river,, 1
dived,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
rose, 1
at, 1
intervals, 1
to, 1
breathe,, 1
until, 1
I, 1
reached, 1
a, 1
ditch, 1
that, 1
had, 1
recently, 1
been, 1
made, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Rhone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
canal, 1
that, 1
runs, 1
from, 1
Beaucaire, 1
to, 1
Aigues-Mortes., 1
I, 1
was, 1
now, 1
safe,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
could, 1
swim, 1
along, 1
the, 1
ditch, 1
without, 1
being, 1
seen,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
canal, 1
in, 1
safety., 1
I, 1
had, 1
designedly, 1
taken, 1
this, 1
direction., 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
of, 1
an, 1
inn-keeper, 1
from, 1
Nimes, 1
who, 1
had, 1
set, 1
up, 1
a, 1
little, 1
tavern, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
from, 1
Bellegarde, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"I, 1
perfectly, 1
recollect, 1
him;, 1
I, 1
think, 1
he, 1
was, 1
your, 1
colleague.", 1
"Precisely,", 1
answered, 1
Bertuccio;, 1
"but, 1
he, 1
had,, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
years, 1
before, 1
this, 1
period,, 1
sold, 1
his, 1
establishment, 1
to, 1
a, 1
tailor, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
who,, 1
having, 1
almost, 1
ruined, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
old, 1
trade,, 1
wished, 1
to, 1

course,, 1
we, 1
made, 1
the, 1

arrangements, 1
with, 1
the, 1
new, 1
landlord, 1
that, 1
we, 1
had, 1
with, 1
the, 1
old;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
of, 1
this, 1
man, 1
that, 1
I, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
shelter.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
become, 1
somewhat, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
Bertuccio's, 1
story., 1
"Gaspard, 1
Caderousse;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
married, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
from, 1
the, 1
village, 1
of, 1
Carconte,, 1
and, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
by, 1
any, 1
other, 1
name, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
her, 1
village., 1
She, 1
was, 1
suffering, 1
from, 1
malarial, 1
fever,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
dying, 1
by, 1
inches., 1
As, 1
for, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
strapping, 1
fellow, 1
of, 1
forty,, 1
or, 1
five, 1
and, 1
forty,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once,, 1
in, 1
time, 1
of, 1
danger,, 1
given, 1
ample, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
and, 1
courage.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
say,", 1
interrupted, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"that, 1
this, 1
took, 1
place, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
year"--, 1
"1829,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
"In, 1
what, 1
month?", 1
"June.", 1
"The, 1
beginning, 1
or, 1
the, 1
end?", 1
"The, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
3d.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
3d, 1
of, 1
June,, 1
1829., 1
Go, 1
on.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
from, 1
Caderousse, 1
that, 1
I, 1
intended, 1
demanding, 1
shelter,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
never, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
door, 1
that, 1
opened, 1
onto, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
I, 1
resolved, 1
not, 1
to, 1
break, 1
through, 1
the, 1
rule,, 1
so, 1
climbing, 1
over, 1
the, 1
garden-hedge,, 1
I, 1
crept, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
olive, 1
and, 1
wild, 1
fig, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
fearing, 1
that, 1
Caderousse, 1
might, 1
have, 1
some, 1
guest,, 1
I, 1
entered, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
shed, 1
in, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
often, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
only, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
inn, 1
by, 1
a, 1
partition,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
holes, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
enable, 1
us, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
announcing, 1
our, 1
presence., 1
My, 1
intention, 1
was,, 1
if, 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
alone,, 1
to, 1
acquaint, 1
him, 1
with, 1
my, 1
presence,, 1
finish, 1
the, 1
meal, 1
the, 1
custom-house, 1
officers, 1
had, 1
interrupted,, 1
and, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
the, 1
threatened, 1
storm, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rhone,, 1
and, 1
ascertain, 1
the, 1
state, 1
of, 1
our, 1
vessel, 1
and, 1
its, 1
crew., 1
I, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
shed,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fortunate, 1
I, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
for, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
Caderousse, 1
entered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stranger., 1
"I, 1
waited, 1
patiently,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
overhear, 1
what, 1
they, 1
said,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
I, 1
could, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
else;, 1
besides,, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing, 1
had, 1
occurred, 1
often, 1
before., 1
The, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
with, 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
the, 1
South, 1
of, 1
France;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
merchants, 1
who, 1
come, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
jewellery, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Beaucaire, 1
fair,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
during, 1
the, 1
month, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
lasts,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
which, 1
there, 1
is, 1
so, 1
great, 1
an, 1
influx, 1
of, 1
merchants, 1
and, 1
customers, 1
from, 1
all, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
Europe,, 1
often, 1
have, 1
dealings, 1
to, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
100,000, 1
to, 1
150,000, 1
francs., 1
Caderousse, 1
entered, 1
hastily., 1
Then,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
empty,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
guarded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
dog,, 1
he, 1
called, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
'Hello,, 1
Carconte,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'the, 1
worthy, 1
priest, 1
has, 1
not, 1
deceived, 1
us;, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
is, 1
real.', 1
An, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
creaked, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
feeble, 1
step., 1
'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say?', 1
asked, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
death., 1
"'I, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
is, 1
real,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
this, 1
gentleman,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
jewellers, 1
of, 1
Paris,, 1
will, 1
give, 1
us, 1
50,000., 1
francs, 1
for, 1
it., 1
Only,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
satisfy, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
it, 1
really, 1
belongs, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
he, 1
wishes, 1
you, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done, 1
already,, 1
the, 1
miraculous, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
came, 1
into, 1
our, 1
possession., 1
In, 1
the, 1
meantime, 1
please, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
monsieur,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
fetch, 1
you, 1
some, 1
refreshment.', 1
The, 1
jeweller, 1
examined, 1
attentively, 1
the, 1
interior, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inn, 1
and, 1
the, 1
apparent, 1
poverty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
him, 1
a, 1
diamond, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
come, 1
from, 1
the, 1
casket, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prince., 1
'Relate, 1
your, 1
story,, 1
madame,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
wishing,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
to, 1
profit, 1
by, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
husband,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
could, 1
not, 1
influence, 1
the, 1
wife's, 1
story,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
the, 1
two, 1
recitals, 1
tallied., 1
"'Oh,', 1
returned, 1
she,, 1
'it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
heaven., 1
My, 1
husband, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
friend,, 1
in, 1
1814, 1
or, 1
1815,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sailor, 1
named, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes., 1
This, 1
poor, 1
fellow,, 1
whom, 1
Caderousse, 1
had, 1
forgotten,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
forgotten, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
his, 1
death, 1
he, 1
bequeathed, 1
this, 1
diamond, 1
to, 1
him.'--'But, 1
how, 1
did, 1
he, 1
obtain, 1
it?', 1
asked, 1
the, 1
jeweller;, 1
'had, 1
he, 1
it, 1
before, 1
he, 1
was, 1
imprisoned?'--'No,, 1
monsieur;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
that, 1
in, 1
prison, 1
he, 1
made, 1
the, 1
acquaintance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
Englishman,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
in, 1
prison, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
sick,, 1
and, 1
Dantes, 1
took, 1
the, 1
same, 1
care, 1
of, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his, 1
brother,, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
set, 1
free,, 1
gave, 1
this, 1
stone, 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
who,, 1
less, 1
fortunate,, 1
died,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
left, 1
it, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
charged, 1
the, 1
excellent, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
here, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
it.'--'The, 1
same, 1
story,', 1
muttered, 1
the, 1
jeweller;, 1
'and, 1
improbable, 1
as, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
at, 1
first,, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be, 1
true., 1
There's, 1
only, 1
the, 1
price, 1
we, 1
are, 1
not, 1
agreed, 1
about.'--'How, 1
not, 1
agreed, 1
about?', 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
'I, 1
thought, 1
we, 1
agreed, 1
for, 1
the, 1
price, 1
I, 1
asked.'--'That, 1
is,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
'I, 1
offered, 1
40,000, 1
francs.'--'Forty, 1
thousand,', 1
cried, 1
La, 1
Carconte;, 1
'we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
part, 1
with, 1
it, 1
for, 1
that, 1
sum., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
told, 1
us, 1
it, 1
was, 1
worth, 1
50,000., 1
without, 1
the, 1
setting.', 1
"'What, 1
was, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
name?', 1
asked, 1
the, 1
indefatigable, 1
questioner.--'The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte.--'He, 1
was, 1
a, 1
foreigner?'--'An, 1
Italian,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
Mantua,, 1
I, 1
believe.'--'Let, 1
me, 1
see, 1
this, 1
diamond, 1
again,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller;, 1
'the, 1
first, 1

Caderousse, 1
took, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
small, 1
case, 1
of, 1
black, 1
shagreen,, 1
opened,, 1

the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1

was, 1
as, 1
large, 1
as, 1
a, 1
hazel-nut,, 1

Carconte's, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
with, 1
cupidity.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
this, 1
fine, 1
story,, 1
eavesdropper?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
credit, 1
it?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1

I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
look, 1
on, 1
Caderousse, 1

a, 1
bad, 1
man,, 1

I, 1
thought, 1
him, 1
incapable, 1
of, 1
committing, 1
a, 1
crime,, 1

even, 1
a, 1
theft.", 1
"That, 1

"Go, 1

"The, 1

enough, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
5,000, 1
francs.'--'As, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller;, 1
'I, 1
had,, 1
however,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
brought, 1
you, 1
the, 1
money, 1
in, 1
bright, 1
coin.', 1
And, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
handful, 1
of, 1
gold,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
it, 1
sparkling, 1
before, 1
the, 1
dazzled, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
innkeeper,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other, 1
hand, 1
he, 1
held, 1
a, 1
packet, 1
of, 1
bank-notes., 1
"There, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
a, 1
severe, 1
struggle, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
Caderousse;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
plain, 1
that, 1
the, 1
small, 1
shagreen, 1
case,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
over, 1
and, 1
over, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
him, 1
commensurate, 1
in, 1
value, 1
to, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
sum, 1
which, 1
fascinated, 1
his, 1
gaze., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
this?', 1
he, 1
asked, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice.--'Let, 1
him, 1
have, 1
it--let, 1
him, 1
have, 1
it,', 1
she, 1
said., 1
'If, 1
he, 1
returns, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire, 1
without, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
inform, 1
against, 1
us,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
says,, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
if, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
ever, 1
again, 1
see, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni?--in, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
see, 1
him.'--'Well,, 1
then,, 1
so, 1
I, 1
will!', 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
'so, 1
you, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
for, 1
45,000, 1
francs., 1
But, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
wants, 1
a, 1
gold, 1
chain,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
want, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
silver, 1
buckles.', 1
The, 1
jeweller, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
long, 1
flat, 1
box,, 1
which, 1
contained, 1
several, 1
samples, 1
of, 1
the, 1
articles, 1
demanded., 1
'Here,', 1
he, 1
said,, 1
'I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
straightforward, 1
in, 1
my, 1
dealings--take, 1
your, 1
choice.', 1
The, 1
woman, 1
selected, 1
a, 1
gold, 1
chain, 1
worth, 1
about, 1
five, 1
louis,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
husband, 1
a, 1

worth, 1
perhaps, 1
fifteen, 1
francs.--'I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
complain, 1
now?', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller., 1
"'The, 1
abbe, 1
told, 1
me, 1
it, 1
was, 1
worth, 1
50,000, 1
francs,', 1
muttered, 1
Caderousse., 1
'Come,, 1
come--give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me!, 1
What, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
fellow, 1
you, 1
are,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
'I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
45,000, 1
francs--that, 1
is,, 1
2,500, 1

of, 1
income,--a, 1
fortune, 1

as, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
I, 1
had, 1
myself,, 1

you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
satisfied!'--'And, 1
the, 1
five, 1
and, 1
forty, 1
thousand, 1
francs,', 1
inquired, 1
Caderousse, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice,, 1
'where, 1
are, 1
they?, 1
Come--let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
them.'--'Here, 1
they, 1
are,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
counted, 1
out, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
table, 1
15,000., 1
francs, 1
in, 1
gold,, 1
and, 1
30,000, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
bank-notes., 1
"'Wait, 1
while, 1
I, 1
light, 1

Carconte;, 1
'it, 1

growing, 1
dark,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
may, 1
be, 1
some, 1
mistake.', 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
night, 1
had, 1
come, 1
on, 1
during, 1
this, 1
conversation,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
night, 1
the, 1
storm, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
threatening, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
half-hour., 1
The, 1
thunder, 1

in, 1

it, 1
was, 1
apparently, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
Caderousse,, 1
or, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
absorbed, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
all, 1
three, 1
with, 1
the, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
gain., 1
I, 1
myself, 1
felt;, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
fascination, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
all, 1
these, 1
bank-notes;, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
always, 1
happens, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
myself, 1
riveted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot., 1
Caderousse, 1
counted, 1
and, 1
again, 1
counted, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
the, 1
notes,, 1
then, 1
handed, 1
them, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
who, 1
counted, 1
and, 1
counted, 1
them, 1
again, 1
in, 1
her, 1
turn., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
jeweller, 1
made, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
play, 1
and, 1
sparkle, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lamplight,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gem, 1
threw, 1
out, 1
jets, 1
of, 1
light, 1
which, 1
made, 1
him, 1
unmindful, 1
of, 1
those, 1
which--precursors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
storm--began, 1
to, 1
play, 1
in, 1
at, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
'Well,', 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
'is, 1
the, 1
cash, 1
all, 1
right?', 1
"'Yes,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
'Give, 1
me, 1
the, 1

find, 1
a, 1
bag, 1

"La, 1
Carconte, 1
went, 1
to, 1
a, 1
cupboard,, 1

returned, 1
with, 1
an, 1
old, 1
leathern, 1
pocket-book, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bag., 1
From, 1
the, 1
former, 1
she, 1
took, 1
some, 1
greasy, 1
letters,, 1

put, 1
in, 1
their, 1
place, 1
the, 1
bank-notes,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bag, 1
took, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
crowns, 1
of, 1
six, 1
livres, 1
each,, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
couple., 1
'There,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
'and, 1
now,, 1
although, 1
you, 1
have, 1
wronged, 1
us, 1
of, 1
perhaps, 1
10,000, 1
francs,, 1
will, 1
you, 1

your, 1
supper, 1
with, 1
us?, 1
I, 1
invite, 1
you, 1
with, 1
good-will.'--'Thank, 1
you,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
'it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
getting, 1
late,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
must, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire--my, 1
wife, 1
will, 1
be, 1
getting, 1
uneasy.', 1
He, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
and, 1
exclaimed,, 1
'Morbleu,, 1
nearly, 1
nine, 1
o'clock--why,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
get, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire, 1
before, 1
midnight!, 1
Good-night,, 1
my, 1
friends., 1
If, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
should, 1
by, 1
any, 1
accident, 1
return,, 1
think, 1
of, 1
me.'--'In, 1
another, 1
week, 1
you, 1
will, 1
have, 1
left, 1
Beaucaire.', 1
remarked, 1
Caderousse,, 1
'for, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
ends, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days.'--'True,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
makes, 1
no, 1
difference., 1
Write, 1
to, 1

journey, 1
on, 1

to, 1
see, 1
him,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
while.', 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tremendous, 1
clap, 1
of, 1
thunder,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
lightning, 1
so, 1
vivid,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
quite, 1
eclipsed, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamp., 1
"'See, 1
here,', 1
exclaimed, 1
Caderousse., 1
'You, 1
cannot, 1
think, 1
of, 1
going, 1
out, 1
in, 1
such, 1
weather, 1
as, 1
this.'--'Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
thunder,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller.--'And, 1
then, 1
there, 1
are, 1
robbers,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
'The, 1
road, 1
is, 1
never, 1
very, 1
safe, 1
during, 1
fair, 1
time.'--'Oh,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
robbers,', 1
said, 1
Joannes,, 1
'here, 1
is, 1
something, 1
for, 1
them,', 1
and, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
small, 1
pistols,, 1
loaded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
muzzle., 1
'Here,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'are, 1
dogs, 1
who, 1
bark, 1
and, 1
bite, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1

are, 1
for, 1

two, 1

longing, 1
for, 1
your, 1
diamond,, 1
Friend, 1
Caderousse.', 1
"Caderousse, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
again, 1
interchanged, 1
a, 1
meaning, 1
look., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
were, 1
both, 1
inspired, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
with, 1
some, 1
horrible, 1
thought., 1
'Well,, 1
then,, 1
a, 1
good, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
you,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse.--'Thanks,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller., 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
his, 1
cane,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
against, 1
an, 1
old, 1
cupboard,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
out., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
such, 1
a, 1
gust, 1
of, 1
wind, 1
came, 1
in, 1
that, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
extinguished., 1
'Oh,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'this, 1
is, 1
very, 1
nice, 1
weather,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
leagues, 1
to, 1
go, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
storm.'--'Remain,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
'You, 1
can, 1
sleep, 1
here.'--'Yes;, 1
do, 1
stay,', 1
added, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tremulous, 1
voice;, 1
'we, 1
will, 1
take, 1
every, 1
care, 1
of, 1
you.'--'No;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
sleep, 1
at, 1
Beaucaire., 1
So,, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
good-night.', 1
Caderousse, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
slowly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
threshold., 1
'I, 1
can, 1
see, 1
neither, 1
heaven, 1
nor, 1
earth,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
door., 1
'Do, 1
I, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
the, 1
right,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left, 1
hand?'--'To, 1
the, 1
right,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
'You, 1
cannot, 1
go, 1
wrong--the, 1
road, 1
is, 1
bordered, 1
by, 1
trees, 1
on, 1
both, 1
sides.'--'Good--all, 1
right,', 1
said, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
almost, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distance., 1
'Close, 1
the, 1
door,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte;, 1
'I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
like, 1
open, 1
doors, 1
when, 1
it, 1
thunders.'--'Particularly, 1
when, 1
there, 1
is, 1
money, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
eh?', 1
answered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
double-locking, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"He, 1
came, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cupboard,, 1
took, 1
out, 1
the, 1
bag, 1
and, 1
pocket-book,, 1
and, 1
both, 1
began,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time,, 1
to, 1
count, 1
their, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
bank-notes., 1
I, 1
never, 1
saw, 1
such, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
cupidity, 1
as, 1
the, 1
flickering, 1
lamp, 1
revealed, 1
in, 1
those, 1
two, 1
countenances., 1
The, 1
woman,, 1
especially,, 1
was, 1
hideous;, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
feverish, 1
tremulousness, 1
was, 1
intensified,, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
had, 1
become, 1
livid,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
resembled, 1
burning, 1
coals., 1
'Why,', 1
she, 1
inquired, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice,, 1
'did, 1
you, 1
invite, 1
him, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
here, 1
to-night?'--'Why?', 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
a, 1
shudder;, 1
'why,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
have, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
of, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
Beaucaire.'--'Ah,', 1
responded, 1
the, 1
woman,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe;, 1
'I, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
something, 1
else.'--'Woman,, 1
woman--why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
have, 1
such, 1
ideas?', 1
cried, 1
Caderousse;, 1
'or,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
them,, 1
why, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
keep, 1
them, 1
to, 1
yourself?'--'Well,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
pause,, 1
'you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
a, 1
man.'--'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?', 1
added, 1
Caderousse.--'If, 1
you, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
let, 1
him, 1
go, 1
from, 1
here.'--'Woman!'--'Or, 1
else, 1
he, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
reached, 1
Beaucaire.'--'Woman!'--'The, 1
road, 1
takes, 1
a, 1
turn--he, 1
is, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
it--while, 1
alongside, 1
of, 1
the, 1
canal, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
shorter, 1
road.'--'Woman!--you, 1
offend, 1
the, 1
good, 1
God., 1
There--listen!', 1
And, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tremendous, 1
peal, 1
of, 1
thunder,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
livid, 1
lightning, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
thunder,, 1
rolling, 1
away, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distance,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
withdraw, 1
unwillingly, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cursed, 1
abode., 1
'Mercy!', 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
crossing, 1
himself., 1
"At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment,, 1

in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
terrifying, 1
silence, 1

usually, 1
follows, 1
a, 1
clap, 1
of, 1
thunder,, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
knocking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Caderousse, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
started, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
aghast, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other., 1
'Who's, 1
there?', 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
rising,, 1
and, 1
drawing, 1
up, 1
in, 1
a, 1
heap, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
notes, 1
scattered, 1
over, 1

he, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands.--'It, 1
is, 1
I,', 1
shouted, 1
a, 1
voice.--'And, 1
who, 1
are, 1
you?'--'Eh,, 1
pardieu,, 1
Joannes,, 1
the, 1
jeweller.'--'Well,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
said, 1
I, 1
offended, 1
the, 1
good, 1
God,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
with, 1
a, 1
horrid, 1
smile., 1
'Why,, 1
the, 1
good, 1
God, 1
sends, 1
him, 1
back, 1
again.', 1
Caderousse, 1
sank, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
breathless, 1
into, 1
his, 1
chair., 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
going, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
step, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
saying,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
did, 1
so--'Come, 1
in,, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Joannes.'--'Ma, 1
foi,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
drenched, 1
with, 1
rain,, 1
'I, 1
am, 1
not, 1

me, 1
hospitality,, 1

roof.', 1
Caderousse, 1
stammered, 1
out, 1
something,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
wiped, 1
away, 1
the, 1
sweat, 1
that, 1
started, 1
to, 1
his, 1
brow., 1

The, 1
Rain, 1
of, 1
Blood., 1
"As, 1
the, 1
jeweller, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
around, 1
him, 1
a, 1
scrutinizing, 1
glance--but, 1
there, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
suspicion,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
did, 1
not, 1
exist,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
confirm, 1
it,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
already, 1
awakened., 1
Caderousse's, 1
hands, 1
still, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
bank-notes,, 1
and, 1
La, 1

called, 1
up, 1
her, 1

smiles, 1

welcoming, 1
the, 1
reappearance, 1
of, 1
their, 1
guest., 1
'Well,, 1
well,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
'you, 1
seem,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
friends,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
had, 1
some, 1
fears, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
accuracy, 1
of, 1
your, 1
money,, 1
by, 1
counting, 1
it, 1
over, 1
so, 1
carefully, 1
directly, 1
I, 1
was, 1
gone.'--'Oh,, 1
no,', 1
answered, 1
Caderousse,, 1
'that, 1
was, 1
not, 1
my, 1
reason,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
by, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
become, 1
possessed, 1
of, 1
this, 1
wealth, 1
are, 1
so, 1
unexpected,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
make, 1
us, 1
scarcely, 1
credit, 1
our, 1
good, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
by, 1
placing, 1
the, 1
actual, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
our, 1
riches, 1
before, 1
our, 1
eyes, 1
that, 1
we, 1
can, 1
persuade, 1
ourselves, 1
that, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
affair, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
dream.', 1
The, 1
jeweller, 1
smiled.--'Have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
other, 1
guests, 1
in, 1
your, 1
house?', 1
inquired, 1
he.--'Nobody, 1
but, 1
ourselves,', 1
replied, 1
Caderousse;, 1
'the, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
we, 1
do, 1
not, 1
lodge, 1
travellers--indeed,, 1
our, 1
tavern, 1
is, 1
so, 1
near, 1
the, 1
town,, 1
that, 1
nobody, 1
would, 1
think, 1
of, 1
stopping, 1
here.'--'Then, 1
I, 1
am, 1
afraid, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
very, 1
much, 1
inconvenience, 1
you.'--'Inconvenience, 1
us?, 1
Not, 1
at, 1
all,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
in, 1
her, 1
most, 1
gracious, 1
manner., 1
'Not, 1
at, 1
all,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you.'--'But, 1
where, 1
will, 1
you, 1
manage, 1
to, 1
stow, 1
me?'--'In, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
overhead.'--'Surely, 1
that, 1
is, 1
where, 1
you, 1
yourselves, 1
sleep?'--'Never, 1
mind, 1
that;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
a, 1
second, 1
bed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room.', 1
Caderousse, 1
stared, 1
at, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
with, 1
much, 1
astonishment., 1
"The, 1
jeweller,, 1
meanwhile,, 1
was, 1
humming, 1
a, 1
song, 1
as, 1
he, 1
stood, 1
warming, 1
his, 1
back, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
had, 1
kindled, 1
to, 1
dry, 1
the, 1
wet, 1
garments, 1
of, 1
her, 1
guest;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
done,, 1
she, 1
next, 1
occupied, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
arranging, 1
his, 1
supper,, 1
by, 1
spreading, 1
a, 1
napkin, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
on, 1
it, 1
the, 1
slender, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
their, 1
dinner,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
she, 1
added, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
fresh-laid, 1
eggs., 1
Caderousse, 1
had, 1
once, 1
more, 1
parted, 1
with, 1
his, 1
treasure--the, 1
banknotes, 1
were, 1
replaced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pocket-book,, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
put, 1
back, 1
into, 1
the, 1
bag,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
carefully, 1
locked, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cupboard., 1
He, 1
then, 1
began, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pensive, 1
and, 1
gloomy, 1
air,, 1
glancing, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
at, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
who, 1
stood, 1
reeking, 1
with, 1
the, 1
steam, 1
from, 1
his, 1
wet, 1
clothes,, 1
and, 1
merely, 1
changing, 1
his, 1
place, 1
on, 1
the, 1
warm, 1
hearth,, 1
to, 1
enable, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
his, 1
garments, 1
to, 1
be, 1
dried., 1
"'There,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
'supper, 1
is, 1
ready, 1
whenever, 1
you, 1
are.'--'And, 1
you?', 1
asked, 1
Joannes.--'I, 1
don't, 1
want, 1
any, 1
supper,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse.--'We, 1
dined, 1
so, 1
very, 1
late,', 1
hastily, 1
interposed, 1
La, 1
Carconte.--'Then, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
alone,', 1
remarked, 1
the, 1
jeweller.--'Oh,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
waiting, 1
upon, 1
you,', 1
answered, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
eager, 1
attention, 1
she, 1
was, 1
not, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
manifest, 1
even, 1
to, 1
guests, 1
who, 1
paid, 1
for, 1
what, 1
they, 1
took., 1
"From, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
Caderousse, 1
darted, 1
on, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
keen,, 1
searching, 1
glances,, 1
but, 1
rapid, 1
as, 1
the, 1
lightning, 1
flash., 1
The, 1
storm, 1
still, 1
continued., 1
'There,, 1
there,', 1
said, 1
La, 1
Carconte;, 1
'do, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
that?, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
you, 1
did, 1
well, 1
to, 1
come, 1
back.'--'Nevertheless,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
'if, 1
by, 1
the, 1
time, 1
I, 1
have, 1
finished, 1
my, 1
supper, 1
the, 1
tempest, 1
has, 1
at, 1
all, 1
abated,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
make, 1
another, 1
start.'--'It's, 1
the, 1
mistral,', 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
'and, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
last, 1
till, 1
to-morrow, 1
morning.', 1
He, 1
sighed, 1
heavily.--'Well,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
table,, 1
'all, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
is,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
worse, 1
for, 1
those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
abroad.'--'Yes,', 1
chimed, 1
in, 1
La, 1
Carconte,, 1
'they, 1
will, 1
have, 1
a, 1
wretched, 1
night, 1
of, 1
it.', 1
"The, 1
jeweller, 1
began, 1
eating, 1
his, 1
supper,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
woman,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
ordinarily, 1
so, 1
querulous, 1
and, 1
indifferent, 1
to, 1
all, 1
who, 1
approached, 1
her,, 1
was, 1
suddenly, 1
transformed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
most, 1
smiling, 1
and, 1
attentive, 1
hostess., 1
Had, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
man, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
lavished, 1
her, 1
assiduities, 1
been, 1
previously, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
so, 1
sudden, 1
an, 1
alteration, 1
might, 1
well, 1
have, 1
excited, 1
suspicion, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
have, 1
greatly, 1
astonished, 1
him., 1
Caderousse,, 1
meanwhile,, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
pace, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
gloomy, 1
silence,, 1
sedulously, 1
avoiding, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
guest;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
had, 1
completed, 1
his, 1
repast,, 1
the, 1
agitated, 1
inn-keeper, 1
went, 1
eagerly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
it., 1
'I, 1
believe, 1
the, 1
storm, 1
is, 1
over,', 1
said, 1
he., 1
But, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
contradict, 1
his, 1
statement,, 1
at, 1
that, 1
instant, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
clap, 1
of, 1
thunder, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
the, 1
house, 1
to, 1
its, 1
very, 1
foundation,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
sudden, 1
gust, 1
of, 1
wind,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
rain,, 1
extinguished, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
he, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
Trembling, 1
and, 1
awe-struck,, 1
Caderousse, 1
hastily, 1
shut, 1
the, 1
door, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
guest,, 1
while, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
lighted, 1
a, 1
candle, 1
by, 1
the, 1
smouldering, 1
ashes, 1
that, 1
glimmered, 1
on, 1
the, 1
hearth., 1
'You, 1
must, 1
be, 1
tired,', 1
said, 1
she, 1
to, 1
the, 1
jeweller;, 1
'I, 1
have, 1
spread, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
white, 1
sheets, 1
on, 1
your, 1
bed;, 1
go, 1
up, 1
when, 1
you, 1
are, 1
ready,, 1
and, 1
sleep, 1
well.', 1
"Joannes, 1
stayed, 1
for, 1
a, 1
while, 1
to, 1
see, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
storm, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
abate, 1
in, 1
its, 1
fury,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
space, 1
of, 1
time, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
him, 1
that,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
diminishing,, 1
the, 1
violence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rain, 1
and, 1
thunder, 1
momentarily, 1
increased;, 1
resigning, 1
himself,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
what, 1
seemed, 1
inevitable,, 1
he, 1
bade, 1
his, 1
host, 1
good-night,, 1
and, 1
mounted, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
He, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
my, 1
head, 1
and, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
flooring, 1
creak, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
footsteps., 1
The, 1
quick,, 1
eager, 1
glance, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
as, 1
he, 1
ascended,, 1
while, 1
Caderousse,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
most, 1
anxiously, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
even, 1
glancing, 1
at, 1
him., 1
"All, 1
these, 1
circumstances, 1
did, 1
not, 1
strike, 1
me, 1
as, 1
painfully, 1
at, 1
the, 1
time, 1
as, 1
they, 1
have, 1
since, 1
done;, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
all, 1
that, 1
had, 1
happened, 1
(with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
the, 1
story, 1
of, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1
which, 1
certainly, 1
did, 1
wear, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
improbability),, 1
appeared, 1
natural, 1
enough,, 1
and, 1
called, 1
for, 1
neither, 1
apprehension, 1
nor, 1
mistrust;, 1
but,, 1
worn, 1
out, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
with, 1
fatigue,, 1
and, 1
fully, 1
purposing, 1
to, 1
proceed, 1
onwards, 1
directly, 1
the, 1
tempest, 1
abated,, 1
I, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hours', 1
sleep., 1
Overhead, 1
I, 1
could, 1
accurately, 1
distinguish, 1
every, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
who,, 1
after, 1
making, 1
the, 1
best, 1
arrangements, 1
in, 1
his, 1
power, 1
for, 1
passing, 1
a, 1
comfortable, 1
night,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
could, 1
hear, 1
it, 1
creak, 1
and, 1
groan, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
weight., 1
Insensibly, 1
my, 1
eyelids, 1
grew, 1
heavy,, 1
deep, 1
sleep, 1
stole, 1
over, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
no, 1
suspicion, 1
of, 1
anything, 1
wrong,, 1
I, 1
sought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
it, 1
off., 1
I, 1
looked, 1
into, 1
the, 1
kitchen, 1
once, 1
more, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Caderousse, 1
sitting, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
a, 1
long, 1
table, 1
upon, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
low, 1
wooden, 1
stools, 1
which, 1
in, 1
country, 1
places, 1
are, 1
frequently, 1
used, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
chairs;, 1
his, 1
back, 1
was, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
me,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance--neither, 1
should, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so, 1
had, 1
he, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
differently,, 1
as, 1
his, 1
head, 1
was, 1
buried, 1
between, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands., 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
gaze, 1
on, 1
him, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time,, 1
then, 1
shrugging, 1
her, 1
shoulders,, 1
she, 1
took, 1
her, 1
seat, 1
immediately, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
him., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
expiring, 1
embers, 1
threw, 1
up, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
flame, 1
from, 1
the, 1
kindling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
wood, 1
that, 1
lay, 1
near,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
light, 1
flashed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
room., 1
La, 1
Carconte, 1
still, 1
kept, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
he, 1
made, 1
no, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
his, 1
position,, 1
she, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
hard,, 1
bony, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
touched, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
forehead., 1
"Caderousse, 1
shuddered., 1
The, 1
woman's, 1
lips, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
move,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
she, 1
were, 1
talking;, 1
but, 1
because, 1
she, 1
merely, 1
spoke, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone,, 1
or, 1
my, 1
senses, 1
were, 1
dulled, 1
by, 1
sleep,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
catch, 1
a, 1
word, 1
she, 1
uttered., 1
Confused, 1
sights, 1
and, 1
sounds, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
float, 1
before, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
gradually, 1
I, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
deep,, 1
heavy, 1
slumber., 1
How, 1
long, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
this, 1
unconscious, 1
state, 1
I, 1
know, 1
not,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
suddenly, 1
aroused, 1
by, 1
the, 1
report, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pistol,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
cry., 1
Weak, 1
and, 1
tottering, 1
footsteps, 1
resounded, 1
across, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
above, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
next, 1
instant, 1
a, 1
dull,, 1
heavy, 1
weight, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
powerless, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase., 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
fully, 1
recovered, 1
consciousness,, 1
when, 1
again, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
groans,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
half-stifled, 1
cries,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
from, 1
persons, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
a, 1
deadly, 1
struggle., 1
A, 1
cry, 1
more, 1
prolonged, 1
than, 1
the, 1
others, 1
and, 1
ending, 1
in, 1
a, 1
series, 1
of, 1
groans, 1
effectually, 1
roused, 1
me, 1
from, 1
my, 1
drowsy, 1
lethargy., 1
Hastily, 1
raising, 1
myself, 1
on, 1
one, 1
arm,, 1
I, 1
looked, 1
around,, 1
but, 1
all, 1
was, 1
dark;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
rain, 1
must, 1
have, 1
penetrated, 1
through, 1
the, 1
flooring, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
above,, 1
for, 1
some, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
moisture, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
fall,, 1
drop, 1
by, 1
drop,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
my, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
my, 1
brow,, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
wet, 1
and, 1
clammy., 1
"To, 1
the, 1
fearful, 1
noises, 1
that, 1
had, 1
awakened, 1
me, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
the, 1
most, 1
perfect, 1
silence--unbroken,, 1
save, 1
by, 1
the, 1
footsteps, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
walking, 1
about, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
above., 1
The, 1
staircase, 1
creaked,, 1
he, 1
descended, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room, 1
below,, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
and, 1
lit, 1
a, 1
candle., 1
The, 1
man, 1
was, 1
Caderousse--he, 1
was, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
his, 1
shirt, 1
was, 1
all, 1
bloody., 1
Having, 1
obtained, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
he, 1
hurried, 1
up-stairs, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
once, 1
more, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
rapid, 1
and, 1
uneasy, 1
footsteps., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
later, 1
he, 1
came, 1
down, 1
again,, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
small, 1
shagreen, 1
case,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
opened,, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
himself, 1
it, 1
contained, 1
the, 1
diamond,--seemed, 1
to, 1
hesitate, 1
as, 1
to, 1
which, 1
pocket, 1
he, 1
should, 1
put, 1
it, 1
in,, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
dissatisfied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
security, 1
of, 1
either, 1
pocket,, 1
he, 1
deposited, 1
it, 1
in, 1
his, 1
red, 1
handkerchief,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
carefully, 1
rolled, 1
round, 1
his, 1
head., 1
After, 1
this, 1
he, 1
took, 1
from, 1
his, 1
cupboard, 1
the, 1
bank-notes, 1
and, 1
gold, 1
he, 1
had, 1
put, 1
there,, 1
thrust, 1
the, 1
one, 1
into, 1
the, 1
pocket, 1
of, 1
his, 1
trousers,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
into, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
waistcoat,, 1
hastily, 1
tied, 1
up, 1
a, 1
small, 1
bundle, 1
of, 1
linen,, 1
and, 1
rushing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night., 1
"Then, 1
all, 1
became, 1
clear, 1
and, 1
manifest, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
reproached, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
I, 1
myself, 1
had, 1
done, 1
the, 1
guilty, 1
deed., 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
I, 1
still, 1
heard, 1
faint, 1
moans,, 1
and, 1
imagining, 1
that, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
jeweller, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
dead,, 1
I, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
his, 1
relief,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
atoning, 1
in, 1
some, 1
slight, 1
degree,, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
I, 1
had, 1
committed,, 1
but, 1
for, 1
that, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
prevent., 1
For, 1
this, 1
purpose, 1
I, 1
applied, 1
all, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
I, 1
possessed, 1
to, 1
force, 1
an, 1
entrance, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cramped, 1
spot, 1
in, 1
which, 1
I, 1
lay, 1
to, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room., 1
The, 1
poorly, 1
fastened, 1
boards, 1
which, 1
alone, 1
divided, 1
me, 1
from, 1
it, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
my, 1
efforts,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
found, 1
myself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house., 1
Hastily, 1
snatching, 1
up, 1
the, 1
lighted, 1
candle,, 1
I, 1
hurried, 1
to, 1
the, 1
staircase;, 1
about, 1
midway, 1
a, 1
body, 1
was, 1
lying, 1
quite, 1
across, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
It, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
The, 1
pistol, 1
I, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
had, 1
doubtless, 1
been, 1
fired, 1
at, 1
her., 1
The, 1
shot, 1
had, 1
frightfully, 1
lacerated, 1
her, 1
throat,, 1
leaving, 1
two, 1
gaping, 1
wounds, 1
from, 1
which,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
mouth,, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
was, 1
pouring, 1
in, 1
floods., 1
She, 1
was, 1
stone, 1
dead., 1
I, 1
strode, 1
past, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
ascended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sleeping, 1
chamber,, 1
which, 1
presented, 1
an, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wildest, 1
disorder., 1
The, 1
furniture, 1
had, 1
been, 1
knocked, 1
over, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deadly, 1
struggle, 1
that, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sheets,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
jeweller, 1
had, 1
doubtless, 1
clung,, 1
were, 1
dragged, 1
across, 1
the, 1
room., 1
The, 1
murdered, 1
man, 1
lay, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
his, 1
head, 1
leaning, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
about, 1
him, 1
was, 1
a, 1
pool, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
which, 1
poured, 1
forth, 1
from, 1
three, 1
large, 1
wounds, 1
in, 1
his, 1
breast;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
fourth, 1
gash,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
long, 1
table, 1
knife, 1
was, 1
plunged, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
handle., 1
"I, 1
stumbled, 1
over, 1
some, 1
object;, 1
I, 1
stooped, 1
to, 1
examine--it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
second, 1
pistol,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
not, 1
gone, 1
off,, 1
probably, 1
from, 1
the, 1
powder, 1
being, 1
wet., 1
I, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
jeweller,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
not, 1
quite, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
my, 1
footsteps, 1
and, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
fixed, 1
them, 1
on, 1
me, 1
with, 1
an, 1
anxious, 1
and, 1
inquiring, 1
gaze,, 1
moved, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
as, 1
though, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
then,, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
the, 1
effort,, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
and, 1
expired., 1
This, 1
appalling, 1
sight, 1
almost, 1
bereft, 1
me, 1
of, 1
my, 1
senses,, 1
and, 1
finding, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
be, 1
of, 1
service, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
my, 1
only, 1
desire, 1
was, 1
to, 1
fly., 1
I, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
clutching, 1
my, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
groan, 1
of, 1
horror., 1
Upon, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
room, 1
below,, 1
I, 1
found, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
custom-house, 1
officers,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
gendarmes--all, 1
heavily, 1
armed., 1
They, 1
threw, 1
themselves, 1
upon, 1
me., 1
I, 1
made, 1
no, 1
resistance;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
master, 1
of, 1
my, 1
senses., 1
When, 1
I, 1
strove, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
a, 1
few, 1
inarticulate, 1
sounds, 1
alone, 1
escaped, 1
my, 1
lips., 1
"As, 1
I, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
significant, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
party, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
my, 1
blood-stained, 1
garments,, 1
I, 1
involuntarily, 1
surveyed, 1
myself,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
warm, 1
drops, 1
that, 1
had, 1
so, 1
bedewed, 1
me, 1
as, 1
I, 1
lay, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Carconte., 1
I, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
I, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
myself., 1
'What, 1
does, 1
he, 1
mean?', 1
asked, 1
a, 1
gendarme., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
officers, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
place, 1
I, 1
directed., 1
'He, 1
means,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
man, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
return,, 1
'that, 1
he, 1
got, 1
in, 1
that, 1
way;', 1
and, 1
he, 1
showed, 1
the, 1
hole, 1
I, 1
had, 1
made, 1
when, 1
I, 1
broke, 1
through., 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
they, 1
took, 1
me, 1
for, 1
the, 1
assassin., 1
I, 1
recovered, 1
force, 1
and, 1
energy, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
free, 1
myself, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
held, 1
me,, 1
while, 1
I, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
stammer, 1
forth--'I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
do, 1
it!, 1
Indeed,, 1
indeed, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not!', 1
A, 1
couple, 1
of, 1
gendarmes, 1
held, 1
the, 1
muzzles, 1
of, 1
their, 1
carbines, 1
against, 1
my, 1
breast.--'Stir, 1
but, 1
a, 1
step,', 1
said, 1
they,, 1
'and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
man.'--'Why, 1
should, 1
you, 1
threaten, 1
me, 1
with, 1
death,', 1
cried, 1
I,, 1
'when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
declared, 1
my, 1
innocence?'--'Tush,, 1
tush,', 1
cried, 1
the, 1
men;, 1
'keep, 1
your, 1
innocent, 1
stories, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
judge, 1
at, 1
Nimes., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
come, 1
along, 1
with, 1
us;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
best, 1
advice, 1
we, 1
can, 1
give, 1
you, 1
is, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so, 1
unresistingly.', 1
Alas,, 1
resistance, 1
was, 1
far, 1
from, 1
my, 1
thoughts., 1
I, 1
was, 1
utterly, 1
overpowered, 1
by, 1
surprise, 1
and, 1
terror;, 1
and, 1
without, 1
a, 1
word, 1
I, 1
suffered, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
handcuffed, 1
and, 1
tied, 1
to, 1
a, 1
horse's, 1
tail,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
they, 1
took, 1
me, 1
to, 1
Nimes., 1
"I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
tracked, 1
by, 1
a, 1
customs-officer,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
me, 1
near, 1
the, 1
tavern;, 1
feeling, 1
certain, 1
that, 1
I, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
night, 1
there,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
summon, 1
his, 1
comrades,, 1
who, 1
just, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
time, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
report, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pistol,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
take, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
such, 1
circumstantial, 1
proofs, 1
of, 1
my, 1
guilt, 1
as, 1
rendered, 1
all, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
proving, 1
my, 1
innocence, 1
utterly, 1
futile., 1
One, 1
only, 1
chance, 1
was, 1
left, 1
me,, 1
that, 1
of, 1
beseeching, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
before, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
every, 1
inquiry, 1
to, 1
be, 1
made, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
inn, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard, 1
on, 1
that, 1
morning., 1
If, 1
Caderousse, 1
had, 1
invented, 1
the, 1
story, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
existed, 1
no, 1
such, 1
person, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
then,, 1
indeed,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
past, 1
redemption,, 1
or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
my, 1
life, 1
hung, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
feeble, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
Caderousse, 1
himself, 1
being, 1
apprehended, 1
and, 1
confessing, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
truth., 1
Two, 1
months, 1
passed, 1
away, 1
in, 1
hopeless, 1
expectation, 1
on, 1
my, 1
part,, 1
while, 1
I, 1
must, 1
do, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
he, 1
used, 1
every, 1
means, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
information, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
I, 1
declared, 1
could, 1
exculpate, 1
me, 1
if, 1
he, 1
would., 1
Caderousse, 1
still, 1
evaded, 1
all, 1
pursuit,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
resigned, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
what, 1
seemed, 1
my, 1
inevitable, 1
fate., 1
My, 1
trial, 1
was, 1
to, 1
come, 1
on, 1
at, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
assizes;, 1
when,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
8th, 1
of, 1
September--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
precisely, 1
three, 1
months, 1
and, 1
five, 1
days, 1
after, 1
the, 1
events, 1
which, 1
had, 1
perilled, 1
my, 1
life--the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
never, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
should, 1
see,, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
prison, 1
doors,, 1
saying, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
that, 1
having, 1
learned, 1
at, 1
Marseilles, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
my, 1
imprisonment,, 1
he, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
my, 1
desire., 1
You, 1
may, 1
easily, 1
imagine, 1
with, 1
what, 1
eagerness, 1
I, 1
welcomed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
how, 1
minutely, 1
I, 1
related, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
and, 1
heard., 1
I, 1
felt, 1
some, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
nervousness, 1
as, 1
I, 1
entered, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
the, 1
diamond,, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
my, 1
inexpressible, 1
astonishment,, 1
he, 1
confirmed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
every, 1
particular,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
my, 1
equal, 1
surprise,, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
place, 1
entire, 1
belief, 1
in, 1
all, 1
I, 1
said., 1
And, 1
then, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that,, 1
won, 1
by, 1
his, 1
mild, 1
charity,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
habits, 1
and, 1
customs, 1
of, 1
my, 1
own, 1
country,, 1
and, 1
considering, 1
also, 1
that, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
the, 1
only, 1
crime, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
was, 1
really, 1
guilty, 1
might, 1
come, 1
with, 1
a, 1
double, 1
power, 1
from, 1
lips, 1
so, 1
benevolent, 1
and, 1
kind,, 1
I, 1
besought, 1
him, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
my, 1
confession,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
seal, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
recounted, 1
the, 1
Auteuil, 1
affair, 1
in, 1
all, 1
its, 1
details,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
every, 1
other, 1
transaction, 1
of, 1
my, 1
life., 1
That, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
done, 1
by, 1
the, 1
impulse, 1
of, 1
my, 1
best, 1
feelings, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
same, 1
effect, 1
as, 1
though, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
calculation., 1
My, 1
voluntary, 1
confession, 1
of, 1
the, 1
assassination, 1
at, 1
Auteuil, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
committed, 1
that, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
stood, 1
accused., 1
When, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
me,, 1
he, 1
bade, 1
me, 1
be, 1
of, 1
good, 1
courage,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
rely, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
doing, 1
all, 1
in, 1
his, 1
power, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
my, 1
judges, 1
of, 1
my, 1
innocence., 1
"I, 1
had, 1
speedy, 1
proofs, 1
that, 1
the, 1
excellent, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
my, 1
behalf,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
rigors, 1
of, 1
my, 1
imprisonment, 1
were, 1
alleviated, 1
by, 1
many, 1
trifling, 1
though, 1
acceptable, 1
indulgences,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
told, 1
that, 1
my, 1
trial, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
postponed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
assizes, 1
following, 1
those, 1
now, 1
being, 1
held., 1
In, 1
the, 1
interim, 1
it, 1
pleased, 1
providence, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
the, 1
apprehension, 1
of, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
discovered, 1
in, 1
some, 1
distant, 1
country,, 1
and, 1
brought, 1
back, 1
to, 1
France,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
full, 1
confession,, 1
refusing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
having, 1
suggested, 1
and, 1
arranged, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
any, 1
excuse, 1
for, 1
his, 1
own, 1
guilt., 1
The, 1
wretched, 1
man, 1
was, 1
sentenced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
galleys, 1
for, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty.", 1
"And, 1
then, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
I, 1
presume,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
came, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
the, 1
bearer, 1
of, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni?", 1
"It, 1
was,, 1
your, 1
excellency;, 1
the, 1
benevolent, 1
abbe, 1
took, 1
an, 1
evident, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
all, 1
that, 1
concerned, 1
me., 1
"'Your, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
life, 1
as, 1
a, 1
smuggler,', 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
me, 1
one, 1
day,, 1
'will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
ruin, 1
of, 1
you;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
get, 1
out,, 1
don't, 1
take, 1
it, 1
up, 1
again.'--'But, 1
how,', 1
inquired, 1
I,, 1
'am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
sister?', 1
"'A, 1
person,, 1
whose, 1
confessor, 1
I, 1
am,', 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
'and, 1
who, 1
entertains, 1
a, 1
high, 1
regard, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
me, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
since, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
him, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
servant., 1
Would, 1
you, 1
like, 1
such, 1
a, 1
post?, 1
If, 1
so,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
you, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
introduction, 1
to, 1
him.'--'Oh,, 1
father,', 1
I, 1
exclaimed,, 1
'you, 1
are, 1
very, 1
good.', 1
"'But, 1
you, 1
must, 1
swear, 1
solemnly, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
have, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
repent, 1
my, 1
recommendation.', 1
I, 1
extended, 1
my, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
pledge, 1
myself, 1
by, 1
any, 1
promise, 1
he, 1
would, 1
dictate,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
stopped, 1
me., 1
'It, 1
is, 1
unnecessary, 1
for, 1
you, 1
to, 1
bind, 1
yourself, 1
by, 1
any, 1
vow,', 1
said, 1
he;, 1
'I, 1

you., 1
Here,, 1
take, 1
this,', 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
after, 1
rapidly, 1
writing, 1
the, 1
few, 1
lines, 1

brought, 1
to, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1

upon, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1

you, 1

to, 1
receive, 1
me, 1
into, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
proudly, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
whether, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
has, 1
ever, 1
had, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
repent, 1
having, 1
done, 1
so?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"I, 1
take, 1
pleasure, 1
in, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
served, 1
me, 1
faithfully,, 1
Bertuccio;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
might, 1
have, 1
shown, 1
more, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
me.", 1
"I,, 1
your, 1
excellency?", 1
"Yes;, 1
you., 1
How, 1
comes, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
having, 1
both, 1
a, 1
sister, 1
and, 1
an, 1
adopted, 1
son,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
never, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
me, 1
of, 1
either?", 1
"Alas,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
still, 1
to, 1
recount, 1
the, 1
most, 1
distressing, 1
period, 1
of, 1
my, 1
life., 1
Anxious, 1
as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
suppose, 1
I, 1
was, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
and, 1
comfort, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sister,, 1
I, 1
lost, 1
no, 1
time, 1
in, 1
hastening, 1
to, 1
Corsica,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
I, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
Rogliano, 1
I, 1
found, 1
a, 1
house, 1
of, 1
mourning,, 1
the, 1
consequences, 1
of, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
so, 1
horrible, 1
that, 1
the, 1
neighbors, 1
remember, 1
and, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
it, 1
to, 1
this, 1
day., 1
Acting, 1
by, 1
my, 1
advice,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
sister, 1
had, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
the, 1
unreasonable, 1
demands, 1
of, 1
Benedetto,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
continually, 1
tormenting, 1
her, 1
for, 1
money,, 1
as, 1
long, 1
as, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
sou, 1
left, 1
in, 1
her, 1
possession., 1
One, 1
morning, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
demanded, 1
money,, 1
threatening, 1
her, 1
with, 1
the, 1
severest, 1
consequences, 1
if, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
supply, 1
him, 1
with, 1
what, 1
he, 1
desired,, 1
he, 1
disappeared, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
away, 1
all, 1
day,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
kind-hearted, 1
Assunta,, 1
who, 1
loved, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
her, 1
own, 1
child,, 1
to, 1
weep, 1
over, 1
his, 1
conduct, 1
and, 1
bewail, 1
his, 1
absence., 1
Evening, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
still,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
patient, 1
solicitude, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mother,, 1
she, 1
watched, 1
for, 1
his, 1
return., 1
"As, 1
the, 1
eleventh, 1
hour, 1
struck,, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
swaggering, 1
air,, 1
attended, 1
by, 1
two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
dissolute, 1
and, 1
reckless, 1
of, 1
his, 1
boon, 1
companions., 1
She, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
seized, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three--none, 1
other, 1
than, 1
the, 1
accursed, 1
Benedetto, 1
exclaimed,--'Put, 1
her, 1
to, 1
torture, 1
and, 1
she'll, 1
soon, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
where, 1
her, 1
money, 1
is.', 1
"It, 1
unfortunately, 1
happened, 1
that, 1
our, 1
neighbor,, 1
Vasilio,, 1
was, 1
at, 1
Bastia,, 1
leaving, 1
no, 1
person, 1
in, 1
his, 1
house, 1
but, 1
his, 1
wife;, 1
no, 1
human, 1
creature, 1
beside, 1
could, 1
hear, 1
or, 1
see, 1
anything, 1
that, 1
took, 1
place, 1
within, 1
our, 1
dwelling., 1
Two, 1
held, 1
poor, 1
Assunta,, 1
who,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
conceive, 1
that, 1
any, 1
harm, 1
was, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
smiled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
were, 1
soon, 1
to, 1
become, 1
her, 1
executioners., 1
The, 1
third, 1
proceeded, 1
to, 1
barricade, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
and, 1
windows,, 1
then, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
three, 1
united, 1
in, 1
stifling, 1
the, 1
cries, 1
of, 1
terror, 1
incited, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
these, 1
preparations,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
dragged, 1
Assunta, 1
feet, 1
foremost, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
brazier,, 1
expecting, 1
to, 1
wring, 1
from, 1
her, 1
an, 1
avowal, 1
of, 1
where, 1
her, 1
supposed, 1
treasure, 1
was, 1
secreted., 1
In, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
her, 1
clothes, 1
caught, 1
fire,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
were, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
let, 1
go, 1
their, 1
hold, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
preserve, 1
themselves, 1
from, 1
sharing, 1
the, 1
same, 1
fate., 1
Covered, 1
with, 1
flames,, 1
Assunta, 1
rushed, 1
wildly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fastened;, 1
she, 1
flew, 1
to, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
also, 1
secured;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
neighbors, 1
heard, 1
frightful, 1
shrieks;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Assunta, 1
calling, 1
for, 1
help., 1
The, 1
cries, 1
died, 1
away, 1
in, 1
groans,, 1
and, 1
next, 1
morning,, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
Vasilio's, 1
wife, 1
could, 1
muster, 1
up, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
venture, 1
abroad,, 1
she, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
our, 1
dwelling, 1
to, 1
be, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
public, 1
authorities,, 1
when, 1
Assunta,, 1
although, 1
dreadfully, 1
burnt,, 1
was, 1
found, 1
still, 1
breathing;, 1
every, 1
drawer, 1
and, 1
closet, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house, 1
had, 1
been, 1
forced, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
money, 1
stolen., 1
Benedetto, 1
never, 1
again, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
Rogliano,, 1
neither, 1
have, 1
I, 1
since, 1
that, 1
day, 1
either, 1
seen, 1
or, 1
heard, 1
anything, 1
concerning, 1
him., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
subsequently, 1
to, 1
these, 1
dreadful, 1
events, 1

I, 1
waited, 1
on, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
folly, 1
to, 1
have, 1
mentioned, 1
Benedetto,, 1
since, 1
all, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
him, 1
seemed, 1
entirely, 1
lost;, 1

of, 1
my, 1
sister,, 1
since, 1
she, 1
was, 1
dead.", 1
"And, 1
in, 1
what, 1
light, 1
did, 1
you, 1
view, 1
the, 1
occurrence?", 1
inquired, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"As, 1
a, 1
punishment, 1
for, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
I, 1
had, 1
committed,", 1
answered, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"Oh,, 1
those, 1
Villeforts, 1
are, 1
an, 1
accursed, 1
race!", 1
"Truly, 1
they, 1
are,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
a, 1
lugubrious, 1
tone., 1
"And, 1
now,", 1
resumed, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"your, 1
excellency, 1
may,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
that, 1
this, 1
place,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
revisit, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time--this, 1
garden,, 1
the, 1
actual, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
my, 1
crime--must, 1
have, 1
given, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
reflections, 1
of, 1
no, 1
very, 1
agreeable, 1
nature,, 1
and, 1
produced, 1
that, 1
gloom, 1
and, 1
depression, 1
of, 1
spirits, 1
which, 1
excited, 1
the, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
express, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
know, 1
the, 1
cause., 1
At, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
a, 1
shudder, 1
passes, 1
over, 1
me, 1
as, 1
I, 1
reflect, 1
that, 1
possibly, 1
I, 1
am, 1
now, 1
standing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
very, 1
grave, 1
in, 1
which, 1
lies, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
by, 1
whose, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
was, 1
dug, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
of, 1
his, 1
child.", 1
"Everything, 1
is, 1
possible,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
rising, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bench, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
sitting;, 1
"even,", 1
he, 1
added, 1
in, 1
an, 1
inaudible, 1
voice,, 1
"even, 1
that, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
be, 1
not, 1
dead., 1
The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
did, 1
right, 1
to, 1
send, 1
you, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ordinary, 1
tone,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
well, 1
in, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
me, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
your, 1
history,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
will, 1
prevent, 1
my, 1
forming, 1
any, 1
erroneous, 1
opinions, 1
concerning, 1
you, 1
in, 1
future., 1
As, 1
for, 1
that, 1
Benedetto,, 1
who, 1
so, 1
grossly, 1
belied, 1
his, 1
name,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
never, 1
made, 1
any, 1
effort, 1
to, 1
trace, 1
out, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
has, 1
gone,, 1
or, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
"No;, 1
far, 1
from, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
has, 1
betaken, 1
himself,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
shun, 1
the, 1
possibility, 1
of, 1
meeting, 1
him, 1
as, 1
I, 1
would, 1
a, 1
wild, 1
beast., 1
Thank, 1
God,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
name, 1
mentioned, 1
by, 1
any, 1
person,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
and, 1
believe, 1
he, 1
is, 1
dead.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"for, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
are, 1
not, 1
so, 1
easily, 1
disposed, 1
of,, 1
for, 1
God, 1

them, 1

make, 1
of, 1
them, 1
instruments, 1

vengeance.", 1
"So, 1
be, 1
it,", 1
responded, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"all, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
of, 1
heaven, 1
is, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
never, 1
see, 1
him, 1
again., 1
And, 1
now,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
he, 1
added,, 1
bowing, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
everything--you, 1
are, 1
my, 1
judge, 1
on, 1
earth,, 1

no, 1
words, 1

consolation?", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
friend,, 1

can, 1
only, 1
repeat, 1
the, 1
words, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
you, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni., 1
Villefort, 1
merited, 1
punishment, 1
for, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
and,, 1
perhaps,, 1
to, 1
others., 1
Benedetto,, 1
if, 1
still, 1
living,, 1
will, 1
become, 1
the, 1
instrument, 1
of, 1
divine, 1
retribution, 1
in, 1
some, 1
way, 1
or, 1
other,, 1

then, 1
be, 1
duly, 1
punished, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn., 1
As, 1
far, 1
as, 1
you, 1
yourself, 1
are, 1
concerned,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
but, 1
one, 1
point, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
guilty., 1
Ask, 1
yourself,, 1
wherefore,, 1
after, 1
rescuing, 1
the, 1
infant, 1
from, 1
its, 1
living, 1
grave,, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
restore, 1
it, 1
to, 1
its, 1
mother?, 1
There, 1
was, 1
the, 1
crime,, 1
Bertuccio--that, 1
was, 1
where, 1
you, 1
became, 1
really, 1
culpable.", 1
"True,, 1
excellency,, 1
that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
crime,, 1
the, 1
real, 1
crime,, 1
for, 1
in, 1
that, 1
I, 1
acted, 1
like, 1
a, 1
coward., 1

first, 1
duty,, 1
directly, 1
I, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
recalling, 1
the, 1
babe, 1
to, 1
life,, 1
was, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
it, 1
to, 1
its, 1
mother;, 1
but,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
have, 1
made, 1
close, 1
and, 1
careful, 1
inquiry,, 1
which, 1
would,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability,, 1
have, 1
led, 1
to, 1
my, 1
own, 1
apprehension;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
clung, 1
to, 1
life,, 1
partly, 1
on, 1
my, 1
sister's, 1
account,, 1
and, 1
partly, 1
from, 1
that, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
pride, 1
inborn, 1
in, 1
our, 1
hearts, 1
of, 1
desiring, 1
to, 1
come, 1
off, 1
untouched, 1
and, 1
victorious, 1
in, 1
the, 1
execution, 1
of, 1
our, 1
vengeance., 1
Perhaps,, 1
too,, 1
the, 1
natural, 1
and, 1
instinctive, 1
love, 1
of, 1
life, 1
made, 1
me, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
endangering, 1
my, 1
own., 1
And, 1
then,, 1
again,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
as, 1
brave, 1
and, 1
courageous, 1
as, 1
was, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
brother.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
hid, 1
his, 1
face, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
as, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
while, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
inscrutable, 1
meaning., 1
After, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
silence,, 1
rendered, 1
still, 1
more, 1
solemn, 1
by, 1
the, 1
time, 1
and, 1
place,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
melancholy, 1
wholly, 1
unlike, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
manner,, 1
"In, 1
order, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
this, 1
conversation, 1
to, 1
a, 1
fitting, 1
termination, 1

to, 1
you, 1
some, 1
words, 1

have, 1
heard, 1
from, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni., 1
For, 1
all, 1
evils, 1
there, 1
are, 1
two, 1
remedies--time, 1
and, 1
silence., 1
And, 1
now, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1
Monsieur, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
alone, 1
here, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden., 1

inflict, 1
on, 1
you,, 1

a, 1
principal, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tragic, 1
scene, 1
enacted, 1
here,, 1
such, 1
painful, 1
emotions,, 1
are, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
a, 1
source, 1
of, 1
something, 1
like, 1
contentment,, 1

serve, 1
but, 1
to, 1
enhance, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
this, 1
dwelling, 1
in, 1
my, 1
estimation., 1
The, 1
chief, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
trees, 1
consists, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deep, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
their, 1
umbrageous, 1
boughs,, 1

fancy, 1
pictures, 1
a, 1
moving, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
shapes, 1
and, 1
forms, 1
flitting, 1
and, 1
passing, 1
beneath, 1
that, 1
shade., 1
Here, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
garden, 1
laid, 1
out, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
way, 1

to, 1
afford, 1
the, 1
fullest, 1
scope, 1
for, 1
the, 1
imagination,, 1

furnished, 1
with, 1
thickly, 1
grown, 1
trees,, 1
beneath, 1

leafy, 1
screen, 1

up, 1
phantoms, 1
at, 1
will., 1

expected, 1

to, 1
find, 1
a, 1
blank, 1
enclosure, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
straight, 1
wall,, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
a, 1
most, 1
agreeable, 1
surprise., 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
ghosts,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
said, 1
that, 1
so, 1
much, 1
harm, 1
had, 1
been, 1
done, 1
by, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
during, 1
six, 1
thousand, 1
years, 1

is, 1
wrought, 1
by, 1

living, 1
in, 1
a, 1

Retire, 1
within,, 1

tranquillize, 1
your, 1
mind., 1

your, 1
confessor, 1
be, 1
less, 1
indulgent, 1
to, 1
you, 1
in, 1
your, 1
dying, 1
moments, 1

calm, 1

soul, 1
ere, 1

goes, 1
forth, 1
to, 1
traverse, 1
the, 1
ocean, 1
called, 1
eternity.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
bowed, 1
respectfully,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
away,, 1
sighing, 1
heavily., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
left, 1
alone,, 1
took, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
steps, 1
onwards,, 1
and, 1
murmured,, 1
"Here,, 1

making, 1
the, 1
tour, 1
of, 1

garden, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
re-entered, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1

Bertuccio,, 1
who, 1
perceived, 1
the, 1
thoughtful, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
features,, 1
took, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
driver, 1
without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
proceeded, 1
rapidly, 1
towards, 1
Paris., 1
That, 1

evening,, 1
upon, 1
reaching, 1

abode, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1

his, 1
principal, 1
attendant, 1
during, 1
this, 1
nocturnal, 1
survey., 1

various, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
Bertuccio, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
improvements, 1

alterations, 1

desired, 1
to, 1
make, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
the, 1
Count,, 1
drawing, 1
out, 1

Ali, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
destined, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
Greek,, 1

were, 1
so, 1
effectually, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tapestried, 1
entrance,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
puzzled, 1

their, 1
existence., 1
Ali,, 1
having, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1

up, 1
three, 1

well, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1

Ali,, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
animation,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative., 1
"Madame, 1
will, 1
be, 1
tired, 1
to-night,", 1
continued, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1

at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1

hastily, 1
descended,, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
already, 1
opened, 1
carriage, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
a, 1
young, 1

completely, 1
enveloped, 1
in, 1
a, 1
green, 1
silk, 1

heavily, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1

She, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
extended, 1
towards, 1
her, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
kissed, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mixture, 1
of, 1
love, 1
and, 1
respect., 1
Some, 1
few, 1
words, 1
passed, 1
between, 1
them, 1
in, 1
that, 1
sonorous, 1
language, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Homer, 1
makes, 1
his, 1
gods, 1
converse., 1
The, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
spoke, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
deep, 1
tenderness,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count, 1
replied, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
gentle, 1
gravity., 1
Preceded, 1

Ali,, 1
who, 1
carried, 1
a, 1
rose-colored, 1
flambeau, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1

In, 1
another, 1
hour, 1
every, 1

a, 1
calash,, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
a, 1

stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1

a, 1

low, 1
over, 1

it, 1
doubtful, 1

person,, 1
in, 1
a, 1

were, 1
emblazoned, 1
the, 1
armorial, 1
bearings, 1
of, 1
a, 1
baron,, 1
and, 1
directed, 1
his, 1
groom, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
at, 1
the, 1
porter's, 1
lodge, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
resided, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
within., 1
While, 1
waiting,, 1
the, 1
occupant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
surveyed, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
he, 1
could, 1
distinguish, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
livery, 1
of, 1
servants, 1
who, 1
passed, 1
to, 1

fro,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
attention, 1
so, 1
close, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
somewhat, 1
impertinent., 1
His, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
keen, 1
but, 1
showed, 1
cunning, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
intelligence;, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
were, 1
straight,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
thin, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
closed,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
drawn, 1
in, 1
over, 1
the, 1
teeth;, 1
his, 1
cheek-bones, 1
were, 1
broad, 1
and, 1
projecting,, 1
a, 1
never-failing, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
audacity, 1
and, 1
craftiness;, 1
while, 1
the, 1
flatness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
enlargement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
his, 1
skull,, 1
which, 1
rose, 1
much, 1
higher, 1
than, 1
his, 1
large, 1
and, 1
coarsely, 1
shaped, 1
ears,, 1
combined, 1
to, 1
form, 1
a, 1
physiognomy, 1
anything, 1
but, 1
prepossessing,, 1
save, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
such, 1
as, 1
considered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
so, 1
splendid, 1
an, 1
equipage, 1
must, 1
needs, 1
be, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
admirable, 1
and, 1
enviable,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
they, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
diamond, 1
that, 1
glittered, 1
in, 1
his, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
red, 1
ribbon, 1
that, 1
depended, 1
from, 1
his, 1
button-hole., 1
The, 1
groom,, 1
in, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1
his, 1
orders,, 1
tapped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window, 1
of, 1
the, 1
porter's, 1
lodge,, 1
saying,, 1
"Pray,, 1
does, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
live, 1
here?", 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
does, 1
reside, 1
here,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
concierge;, 1
"but"--added, 1
he,, 1
glancing, 1
an, 1
inquiring, 1
look, 1
at, 1
Ali., 1
Ali, 1
returned, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
negative., 1
"But, 1
what?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
groom., 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
does, 1
not, 1
receive, 1
visitors, 1
to-day.", 1
"Then, 1
here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
master's, 1
card,--the, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars., 1
You, 1
will, 1
take, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
say, 1
that,, 1
although, 1
in, 1
haste, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
the, 1
Chamber,, 1
my, 1
master, 1
came, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
way, 1
to, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
calling, 1
upon, 1
him.", 1
"I, 1
never, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
his, 1
excellency,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
concierge;, 1
"the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
will, 1
carry, 1
your, 1
message.", 1
The, 1
groom, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
The, 1
man,, 1
somewhat, 1
crest-fallen, 1
by, 1
the, 1
rebuke, 1
he, 1
had, 1
received,, 1
repeated, 1
what, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
had, 1
said., 1
"Bless, 1
me,", 1
murmured, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars,, 1
"this, 1
must, 1
surely, 1
be, 1
a, 1
prince, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
a, 1
count, 1
by, 1
their, 1
styling, 1
him, 1
'excellency,', 1
and, 1
only, 1
venturing, 1
to, 1
address, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
medium, 1
of, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre., 1
However,, 1
it, 1
does, 1
not, 1
signify;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
credit, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
so, 1
I, 1
must, 1
see, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
requires, 1
his, 1
money.", 1
Then,, 1
throwing, 1
himself, 1
back, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
Danglars, 1
called, 1
out, 1
to, 1
his, 1
coachman,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
that, 1
might, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
across, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
"To, 1
the, 1
Chamber, 1
of, 1
Deputies.", 1
Apprised, 1
in, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
paid, 1
him,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had,, 1
from, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
blinds, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pavilion,, 1
as, 1
minutely, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
baron,, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
lorgnette,, 1
as, 1
Danglars, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
scrutinized, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
garden,, 1
and, 1
servants., 1
"That, 1
fellow, 1
has, 1
a, 1
decidedly, 1
bad, 1
countenance,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
disgust,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
shut, 1
up, 1
his, 1
glass, 1
into, 1
its, 1
ivory, 1
case., 1
"How, 1
comes, 1
it, 1
that, 1
all, 1
do, 1
not, 1
retreat, 1
in, 1
aversion, 1
at, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
that, 1
flat,, 1
receding,, 1
serpent-like, 1
forehead,, 1
round,, 1
vulture-shaped, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
sharp-hooked, 1
nose,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
beak, 1
of, 1
a, 1
buzzard?, 1
Ali,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
striking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brazen, 1
gong., 1
Ali, 1
appeared., 1
"Summon, 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Almost, 1
immediately, 1
Bertuccio, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
"Did, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me?", 1
inquired, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
did,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"You, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
standing, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
since, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door?", 1
"Certainly,, 1
your, 1
excellency., 1
I, 1
noticed, 1
them, 1
for, 1
their, 1
remarkable, 1
beauty.", 1
"Then, 1
how, 1
comes, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
frown,, 1
"that,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
desired, 1
you, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
for, 1
me, 1
the, 1
finest, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
horses, 1

another, 1
pair,, 1
fully, 1
as, 1
fine, 1
as, 1
mine,, 1
not, 1
in, 1
my, 1
stables?", 1
At, 1
the, 1
look, 1
of, 1
displeasure,, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
angry, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
spoke,, 1
Ali, 1
turned, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
held, 1
down, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
your, 1
fault,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
Ali,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Arabic, 1
language,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gentleness, 1
none, 1
would, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
him, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
showing,, 1
either, 1
in, 1
voice, 1
or, 1
face--"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
your, 1
fault., 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
points, 1
of, 1
English, 1
horses.", 1
The, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Ali, 1
recovered, 1
its, 1
serenity., 1
"Permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
were, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sold, 1
when, 1
I, 1
purchased, 1
yours.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"It, 1
seems,, 1
sir, 1
steward,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
yet, 1
to, 1
learn, 1

price.", 1
"His, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
not,, 1
perhaps,, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
gave, 1
16,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
his, 1
horses?", 1
"Very, 1
well., 1
Then, 1
offer, 1
him, 1
double, 1
that, 1
sum;, 1
a, 1
banker, 1
never, 1
loses, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
doubling, 1
his, 1
capital.", 1
"Is, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
really, 1
in, 1
earnest?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
steward., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
regarded, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
durst, 1
presume, 1
to, 1
doubt, 1
his, 1
words, 1
with, 1
the, 1
look, 1
of, 1
one, 1
equally, 1
surprised, 1
and, 1
displeased., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
this, 1
evening,", 1
replied, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
desire, 1
that, 1
these, 1
horses,, 1
with, 1
completely, 1
new, 1
harness,, 1
may, 1
be, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
with, 1
my, 1

Bertuccio, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
retire;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
he, 1
paused,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
"At, 1
what, 1
o'clock, 1
does, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
wish, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
horses, 1
to, 1

"At, 1
five, 1
o'clock,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
excellency's, 1
pardon,", 1
interposed, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
in, 1
a, 1
deprecating, 1
manner,, 1
"for, 1

already, 1
two, 1
o'clock.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
perfectly, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
that, 1
fact,", 1
answered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
calmly., 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Ali,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Let, 1
all, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
in, 1
my, 1

Request, 1
her, 1
also, 1
to, 1

Now,, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1

Scarcely, 1
had, 1
Ali, 1
disappeared, 1
when, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
chamber., 1
"Monsieur, 1
Baptistin,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1

know, 1

I, 1
also, 1

"Oh,, 1

exclaimed, 1
Baptistin, 1
eagerly., 1
"Listen,, 1

replied, 1
Monte, 1

"You, 1

stood, 1

effect, 1
on, 1

to, 1

"By, 1
no, 1

the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
frigid, 1
tones;, 1
"Ali, 1
has, 1
many, 1

fail, 1
in, 1

Baptistin, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
astonishment., 1
"You, 1
seem, 1
incredulous,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
who, 1
repeated, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Arabic, 1
language, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
been, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
Baptistin, 1
in, 1
French., 1
The, 1
Nubian, 1
smiled, 1
assentingly, 1
to, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
words,, 1
then,, 1
kneeling, 1
on, 1
one, 1
knee,, 1
respectfully, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
This, 1
corroboration, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lesson, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
received, 1
put, 1
the, 1
finishing, 1
stroke, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wonder, 1
and, 1
stupefaction, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Baptistin., 1
The, 1
count, 1
then, 1
motioned, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
to, 1
retire,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
where, 1
they, 1
conversed, 1
long, 1
and, 1
earnestly, 1
together., 1
As, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
five, 1
the, 1
count, 1
struck, 1
thrice, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
gong., 1
When, 1
Ali, 1
was, 1
wanted, 1
one, 1
stroke, 1
was, 1
given,, 1
two, 1
summoned, 1
Baptistin,, 1
and, 1
three, 1
Bertuccio., 1
The, 1
steward, 1
entered., 1
"My, 1
horses,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"They, 1
are, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
harnessed, 1

Does, 1
your, 1

me, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
him?", 1
"No,, 1
the, 1
coachman,, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
Baptistin, 1
will, 1
go.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mansion,, 1
and, 1
beheld, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
the, 1
very, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
horses, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
much, 1
admired, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
as, 1
the, 1
property, 1
of, 1
Danglars., 1
As, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
them, 1
he, 1
said--"They, 1
are, 1
extremely, 1
handsome, 1
certainly,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
well, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
them,, 1

you, 1
were, 1
somewhat, 1
remiss, 1
not, 1
to, 1
have, 1
procured, 1
them, 1
sooner.", 1
"Indeed,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
very, 1
considerable, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
obtaining, 1
them,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
is,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
cost, 1
an, 1
enormous, 1
price.", 1
"Does, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
you, 1
gave, 1
for, 1
them, 1
make, 1
the, 1
animals, 1
less, 1
beautiful,", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
shrugging, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"Nay,, 1
if, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
satisfied,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
all, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
wish., 1
Whither, 1
does, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
be, 1
driven?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
residence, 1
of, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars,, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Chaussee, 1
d'Antin.", 1
This, 1
conversation, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
as, 1
they, 1
stood, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
terrace,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
a, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
stone, 1
steps, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
carriage-drive., 1
As, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
respectful, 1
bow,, 1
was, 1
moving, 1
away,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
called, 1
him, 1
back., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
another, 1
commission, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
having, 1
an, 1
estate, 1
by, 1
the, 1
seaside, 1
in, 1
Normandy--for, 1
instance,, 1
between, 1
Havre, 1
and, 1
Boulogne., 1
You, 1
see, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
a, 1
wide, 1
range., 1
It, 1
will, 1
be, 1
absolutely, 1
necessary, 1
that, 1
the, 1
place, 1
you, 1
may, 1
select, 1

a, 1
small, 1
harbor,, 1

bay,, 1
into, 1

my, 1

She, 1

She, 1
must, 1
be, 1
kept, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
readiness, 1

requisite, 1
inquiries, 1
for, 1
a, 1

think,, 1
be, 1
on, 1
her, 1
way, 1

Fecamp,, 1
must, 1
she, 1
not?", 1
"Certainly,, 1
your, 1
excellency;, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
put, 1
to, 1
sea, 1
the, 1
same, 1
evening, 1
we, 1
quitted, 1
Marseilles.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
yacht.", 1
"Was, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
at, 1
Martigues.", 1
"'Tis, 1
well., 1

"Your, 1

Count, 1
made, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
satisfaction,, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
terrace, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
whirled, 1
along, 1
swiftly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
house., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment,, 1
presiding, 1
over, 1
a, 1
railroad, 1
committee., 1
But, 1
the, 1
meeting, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
concluded, 1
when, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
his, 1
visitor, 1
was, 1
announced., 1
As, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
title, 1
sounded, 1
on, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
he, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
addressing, 1
his, 1
colleagues,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
members, 1
of, 1
one, 1
or, 1
the, 1
other, 1
Chamber,, 1
he, 1
said,--"Gentlemen,, 1
pardon, 1
me, 1
for, 1
leaving, 1
you, 1
so, 1
abruptly;, 1
but, 1
a, 1
most, 1
ridiculous, 1
circumstance, 1
has, 1
occurred,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
this,--Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
bankers,, 1
have, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
me, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
person, 1
calling, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
given, 1
him, 1
an, 1
unlimited, 1
credit, 1
with, 1
me., 1
I, 1
confess, 1
this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
drollest, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
met, 1
with, 1
in, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
my, 1
extensive, 1
foreign, 1
transactions,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
may, 1
readily, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
has, 1
greatly, 1
roused, 1
my, 1
curiosity., 1
I, 1
took, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
to, 1
call, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pretended, 1
count--if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
a, 1
real, 1
count, 1
he, 1
wouldn't, 1
be, 1
so, 1
rich., 1
But,, 1
would, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
it,, 1
'He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
receiving.', 1
So, 1
the, 1
master, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gives, 1
himself, 1
airs, 1
befitting, 1
a, 1
great, 1
millionaire, 1
or, 1
a, 1
capricious, 1
beauty., 1
I, 1
made, 1
inquiries,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
that, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees, 1
is, 1
his, 1
own, 1
property,, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
it, 1
was, 1
very, 1
decently, 1
kept, 1
up., 1
But,", 1
pursued, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sinister, 1
smiles,, 1
"an, 1
order, 1
for, 1
unlimited, 1
credit, 1
calls, 1
for, 1
something, 1
like, 1
caution, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
that, 1
order, 1
is, 1
given., 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
this, 1
man., 1
I, 1
suspect, 1
a, 1
hoax, 1
is, 1
intended,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
instigators, 1
of, 1
it, 1
little, 1
knew, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
had, 1
to, 1
deal, 1
with., 1
'They, 1
laugh, 1
best, 1
who, 1
laugh, 1
last!'", 1
Having, 1
delivered, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
this, 1
pompous, 1
address,, 1
uttered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
energy, 1
that, 1
left, 1
the, 1
baron, 1
almost, 1
out, 1
of, 1
breath,, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
assembled, 1
party, 1
and, 1
withdrew, 1
to, 1
his, 1
drawing-room,, 1
whose, 1
sumptuous, 1
furnishings, 1
of, 1
white, 1
and, 1
gold, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
a, 1
great, 1
sensation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chaussee, 1
d'Antin., 1
It, 1
was, 1
to, 1
this, 1
apartment, 1
he, 1
had, 1
desired, 1
his, 1
guest, 1
to, 1
be, 1
shown,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
overwhelming, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
so, 1
much, 1
luxury., 1
He, 1
found, 1
the, 1
count, 1
standing, 1
before, 1
some, 1
copies, 1
of, 1
Albano, 1
and, 1
Fattore, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
passed, 1
off, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
as, 1
originals;, 1
but, 1
which,, 1
mere, 1
copies, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
their, 1
degradation, 1
in, 1
being, 1
brought, 1
into, 1
juxtaposition, 1
with, 1
the, 1
gaudy, 1
colors, 1
that, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
ceiling., 1
The, 1
count, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
as, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
Danglars, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room., 1
With, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
inclination, 1
of, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
Danglars, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seated,, 1
pointing, 1
significantly, 1
to, 1
a, 1
gilded, 1
arm-chair,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
white, 1
satin, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
gold., 1
The, 1
count, 1
sat, 1
down., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor,, 1
I, 1
presume,, 1
of, 1
addressing, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
of, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars,, 1
chevalier, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor,, 1
and, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chamber, 1
of, 1
Deputies?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
repeated, 1
all, 1
the, 1
titles, 1
he, 1
had, 1
read, 1
on, 1
the, 1
baron's, 1
card., 1
Danglars, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
irony, 1
and, 1
compressed, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
"You, 1
will,, 1
I, 1
trust,, 1
excuse, 1
me,, 1
monsieur,, 1
for, 1
not, 1
calling, 1
you, 1
by, 1
your, 1
title, 1
when, 1
I, 1
first, 1
addressed, 1
you,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
we, 1
are, 1
living, 1
under, 1
a, 1
popular, 1
form, 1
of, 1
government,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
myself, 1
a, 1
representative, 1
of, 1
the, 1
liberties, 1
of, 1
the, 1
people.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that, 1
while, 1
you, 1
call, 1
yourself, 1
baron, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
willing, 1
to, 1
call, 1
anybody, 1
else, 1
count.", 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
affected, 1
carelessness,, 1
"I, 1
attach, 1
no, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
value, 1
to, 1
such, 1
empty, 1
distinctions;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
made, 1
baron,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
chevalier, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor,, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
services, 1
rendered,, 1
but"--, 1
"But, 1
you, 1
have, 1
discarded, 1
your, 1
titles, 1
after, 1
the, 1
example, 1
set, 1
you, 1
by, 1
Messrs., 1
de, 1
Montmorency, 1
and, 1
Lafayette?, 1
That, 1
was, 1
a, 1
noble, 1
example, 1
to, 1
follow,, 1
monsieur.", 1
"Why,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
"not, 1
entirely, 1
so;, 1
with, 1
the, 1
servants,--you, 1
understand.", 1
"I, 1
see;, 1
to, 1
your, 1
domestics, 1
you, 1
are, 1
'my, 1
lord,', 1
the, 1
journalists, 1
style, 1
you, 1
'monsieur,', 1
while, 1
your, 1
constituents, 1
call, 1
you, 1
'citizen.', 1
These, 1
are, 1
distinctions, 1
very, 1
suitable, 1
under, 1
a, 1
constitutional, 1
government., 1
I, 1
understand, 1
perfectly.", 1
Again, 1
Danglars, 1
bit, 1
his, 1
lips;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
no, 1
match, 1
for, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
an, 1
argument, 1
of, 1
this, 1
sort,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
subjects, 1
more, 1
congenial., 1
"Permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
you,, 1
Count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
bowing,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
received, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
advice, 1
from, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
of, 1
Rome.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
it,, 1
baron,--for, 1
I, 1
must, 1
claim, 1
the, 1
privilege, 1
of, 1
addressing, 1
you, 1
after, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
your, 1
servants., 1
I, 1
have, 1
acquired, 1
the, 1
bad, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
calling, 1
persons, 1
by, 1
their, 1
titles, 1
from, 1
living, 1
in, 1
a, 1
country, 1
where, 1
barons, 1
are, 1
still, 1
barons, 1
by, 1
right, 1
of, 1
birth., 1
But, 1
as, 1
regards, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
advice,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
charmed, 1
to, 1
find, 1
that, 1
it, 1
has, 1
reached, 1
you;, 1
that, 1
will, 1
spare, 1
me, 1
the, 1
troublesome, 1
and, 1
disagreeable, 1
task, 1
of, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
you, 1
for, 1
money, 1
myself., 1
You, 1
have, 1
received, 1
a, 1
regular, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
advice?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
confess, 1
I, 1
didn't, 1
quite, 1
comprehend, 1
its, 1
meaning.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
"And, 1
for, 1
that, 1
reason, 1
I, 1
did, 1
myself, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
calling, 1
upon, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1

"Go, 1
on,, 1
monsieur., 1
Here, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
any, 1
explanation, 1
you, 1

"Why,", 1
said, 1
Danglers,, 1
"in, 1
the, 1
letter--I, 1
believe, 1
I, 1
have, 1
it, 1
about, 1
me"--here, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
in, 1
his, 1
breast-pocket--"yes,, 1
here, 1
it, 1
is., 1
Well,, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
gives, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
unlimited, 1
credit, 1
on, 1
our, 1
house.", 1
"Well,, 1
baron,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
there, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
about, 1
that?", 1
"Merely, 1
the, 1
term, 1
unlimited--nothing, 1
else,, 1
certainly.", 1
"Is, 1
not, 1
that, 1
word, 1
known, 1
in, 1
France?, 1
The, 1
people, 1

"Oh,, 1
as, 1
for, 1
the, 1
composition, 1
of, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
said;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
regards, 1
the, 1
competency, 1
of, 1
the, 1
document,, 1
I, 1
certainly, 1
have, 1
doubts.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
assuming, 1
all, 1
air, 1
and, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
simplicity, 1
and, 1
candor., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
that, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
are, 1
not, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
safe, 1
and, 1
solvent, 1
bankers?, 1
Pray, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
think,, 1
baron,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
uneasy,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
having, 1
some, 1
considerable, 1
property, 1
in, 1
their, 1
hands.", 1
"Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
are, 1
perfectly, 1
solvent,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
mocking, 1
smile:, 1
"but, 1
the, 1
word, 1
unlimited,, 1
in, 1
financial, 1
affairs,, 1
is, 1
so, 1
extremely, 1
vague.", 1
"Is,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
unlimited,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Precisely, 1
what, 1
I, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
say,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars., 1
"Now, 1
what, 1
is, 1
vague, 1
is, 1
doubtful;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
wise, 1
man, 1
who, 1
said,, 1
'when, 1
in, 1
doubt,, 1
keep, 1
out.'", 1
"Meaning, 1
to, 1
say,", 1
rejoined, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that, 1
however, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
may, 1
be, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
acts, 1
of, 1
imprudence, 1
and, 1
folly,, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
not, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
their, 1
example.", 1
"Not, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
"Plainly, 1
enough., 1
Messrs., 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
set, 1
no, 1
bounds, 1
to, 1
their, 1
engagements, 1
while, 1
those, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
have, 1
their, 1
limits;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
wise, 1
man,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
showing.", 1
"Monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
drawing, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
with, 1
a, 1
haughty, 1
air,, 1
"the, 1
extent, 1
of, 1
my, 1
resources, 1
has, 1
never, 1
yet, 1
been, 1
questioned.", 1
"It, 1
seems,, 1
then,, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
coldly,, 1
"to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
"By, 1
what, 1
right,, 1
sir?", 1
"By, 1
right, 1
of, 1
the, 1
objections, 1
you, 1
have, 1
raised,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
explanations, 1
you, 1
have, 1
demanded,, 1
which, 1
certainly, 1
must, 1
have, 1
some, 1
motive.", 1
Once, 1
more, 1
Danglars, 1
bit, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
worsted,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
time, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
ground., 1
His, 1
forced, 1
politeness, 1
sat, 1
awkwardly, 1
upon, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
impertinence., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
preserved, 1
a, 1
graceful, 1
suavity, 1
of, 1
demeanor,, 1
aided, 1
by, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
simplicity, 1
he, 1
could, 1
assume, 1
at, 1
pleasure,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
possessed, 1
the, 1
advantage., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
resumed, 1
Danglars,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
silence,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
make, 1
myself, 1
understood,, 1
by, 1
requesting, 1
you, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
me, 1
for, 1
what, 1
sum, 1
you, 1
propose, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
upon, 1
me?", 1
"Why,, 1
truly,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
determined, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
an, 1
inch, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gained,, 1
"my, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
desiring, 1
an, 1
'unlimited', 1
credit, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1
because, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
how, 1
much, 1
money, 1
I, 1
might, 1
need.", 1
The, 1
banker, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
time, 1
had, 1
come, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
upper, 1
hand., 1
So, 1
throwing, 1
himself, 1
back, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arm-chair,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
arrogant, 1
and, 1
purse-proud, 1
air,--"Let, 1
me, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
hesitate, 1
in, 1
naming, 1
your, 1
wishes;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
then, 1
be, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
the, 1
resources, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
however, 1
limited,, 1
are, 1
still, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
meeting, 1
the, 1
largest, 1
demands;, 1
and, 1
were, 1
you, 1
even, 1
to, 1
require, 1
a, 1
million"--, 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
pardon,", 1
interposed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
said, 1
a, 1
million,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
confidence, 1
of, 1
ignorance., 1
"But, 1
could, 1
I, 1
do, 1
with, 1
a, 1
million?", 1
retorted, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
if, 1
a, 1
trifle, 1
like, 1
that, 1
could, 1
suffice, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
never, 1
have, 1
given, 1
myself, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
of, 1
opening, 1
an, 1
account., 1
A, 1
million?, 1
Excuse, 1
my, 1
smiling, 1
when, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sum, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
in, 1
my, 1
pocket-book, 1
or, 1
dressing-case.", 1
And, 1
with, 1
these, 1
words, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
small, 1
case, 1
containing, 1
his, 1
visiting-cards,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
forth, 1
two, 1
orders, 1
on, 1
the, 1
treasury, 1
for, 1
500,000, 1
francs, 1
each,, 1
payable, 1
at, 1
sight, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bearer., 1
A, 1
man, 1
like, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
inaccessible, 1
to, 1
any, 1
gentler, 1
method, 1
of, 1
correction., 1
The, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
the, 1
present, 1
revelation, 1
was, 1
stunning;, 1
he, 1
trembled, 1
and, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
verge, 1
of, 1
apoplexy., 1
The, 1
pupils, 1
of, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
dilated, 1
horribly., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"confess, 1
honestly, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
perfect, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
Thomson, 1

French., 1
I, 1
understand,, 1
and, 1
foreseeing, 1
that, 1
such, 1
might, 1
be, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
took,, 1
in, 1

of, 1
my, 1
ignorance, 1
of, 1
affairs,, 1
certain, 1
precautions., 1
See,, 1

minuteness, 1

The, 1
decorations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boudoir, 1
had, 1
then, 1
been, 1
left, 1
entirely, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray., 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
however,, 1
while, 1
possessing, 1
a, 1
great, 1
admiration, 1
for, 1
the, 1
antique,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
understood, 1
during, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Directory,, 1
entertained, 1
the, 1
most, 1
sovereign, 1
contempt, 1
for, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
elegance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
favorite, 1
sitting-room,, 1
where,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
way,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
never, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
intrude,, 1
unless,, 1
indeed,, 1
he, 1
excused, 1
his, 1
own, 1
appearance, 1
by, 1
ushering, 1
in, 1
some, 1
more, 1
agreeable, 1
visitor, 1
than, 1
himself;, 1
and, 1
even, 1
then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
air, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
person, 1
who, 1
was, 1
himself, 1
introduced,, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
being, 1
the, 1
presenter, 1
of, 1
another,, 1
his, 1
reception, 1
being, 1
cordial, 1
or, 1
frigid,, 1
in, 1
proportion, 1
as, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
chanced, 1
to, 1
please, 1
or, 1
displease, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
(who,, 1
although, 1
past, 1
the, 1
first, 1
bloom, 1
of, 1
youth,, 1
was, 1
still, 1
strikingly, 1
handsome), 1
was, 1
now, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
piano,, 1
a, 1
most, 1
elaborate, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
cabinet, 1
and, 1
inlaid, 1
work,, 1
while, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray,, 1
standing, 1
before, 1
a, 1
small, 1
work-table,, 1
was, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
pages, 1
of, 1
an, 1
album., 1
Lucien, 1
had, 1
found, 1
time,, 1
preparatory, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
arrival,, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
many, 1
particulars, 1
respecting, 1
him, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
It, 1
will, 1
be, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
made, 1
a, 1
lively, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
the, 1
minds, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
party, 1
assembled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
breakfast, 1
given, 1
by, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf;, 1
and, 1
although, 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
such, 1
feelings,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
off, 1
the, 1
powerful, 1
influence, 1
excited, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
by, 1
the, 1
impressive, 1
look, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
consequently, 1
the, 1
description, 1
given, 1
by, 1
Lucien, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
bore, 1
the, 1
highly-colored, 1
tinge, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
heated, 1
imagination., 1
Already, 1
excited, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wonderful, 1
stories, 1
related, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
by, 1
De, 1
Morcerf,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
wonder, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
eagerly, 1
listened, 1
to,, 1
and, 1
fully, 1
credited,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
additional, 1
circumstances, 1
detailed, 1
by, 1
Debray., 1
This, 1
posing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
piano, 1
and, 1
over, 1
the, 1
album, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
little, 1
ruse, 1
adopted, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
precaution., 1
A, 1
most, 1
gracious, 1
welcome, 1
and, 1
unusual, 1
smile, 1
were, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
M., 1
Danglars;, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
his, 1
gentlemanly, 1
bow,, 1
received, 1
a, 1
formal, 1
though, 1
graceful, 1
courtesy,, 1
while, 1
Lucien, 1
exchanged, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
distant, 1
recognition,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
Danglars, 1
a, 1
free, 1
and, 1
easy, 1
nod., 1
"Baroness,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"give, 1
me, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
present, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1

has, 1
been, 1
most, 1
warmly, 1
recommended, 1
to, 1
me, 1
by, 1
my, 1
correspondents, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
I, 1
need, 1
but, 1
mention, 1
one, 1
fact, 1
to, 1
make, 1
all, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
court, 1
his, 1
notice,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
come, 1
to, 1
take, 1
up, 1
his, 1
abode, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
brief, 1
period, 1
he, 1
proposes, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
six, 1
millions, 1
of, 1
money., 1

means, 1
balls,, 1
dinners,, 1
and, 1
lawn, 1
parties, 1
without, 1
end,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
trust, 1
the, 1
count, 1
will, 1
remember, 1
us,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
may, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
him,, 1
in, 1
our, 1
own, 1
humble, 1
entertainments.", 1
In, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gross, 1
flattery, 1
and, 1
coarseness, 1
of, 1
this, 1
address,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
could, 1
not, 1
forbear, 1
gazing, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
interest, 1
on, 1
a, 1
man, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
expending, 1
six, 1
millions, 1
in, 1
twelve, 1
months,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
selected, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
his, 1
princely, 1
extravagance., 1
"And, 1
when, 1
did, 1
you, 1
arrive, 1
here?", 1
inquired, 1
she., 1
"Yesterday, 1
morning,, 1

"Coming,, 1

usual,, 1
I, 1

from, 1
the, 1
extreme, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1

such, 1

your, 1
custom.", 1
"Nay,, 1
madame., 1
This, 1
time, 1
I, 1
have, 1
merely, 1
come, 1
from, 1
Cadiz.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
selected, 1
a, 1
most, 1
unfavorable, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
your, 1
first, 1
visit., 1
Paris, 1
is, 1
a, 1
horrible, 1
place, 1
in, 1
summer., 1
Balls,, 1
parties,, 1

fetes, 1

is, 1
in, 1
London;, 1
the, 1
French, 1
opera, 1
everywhere, 1

in, 1
Paris., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
Theatre, 1
Francais,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
that, 1
it, 1

races, 1
at, 1
the, 1

de, 1

shall, 1

do, 1
at, 1

the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1

some, 1
one, 1

me, 1
into, 1
the, 1

ideas, 1
of, 1
amusement.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
horses,, 1
count?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
part, 1
of, 1
my, 1
life, 1
in, 1
the, 1
East,, 1
madame,, 1

you, 1
are, 1
doubtless, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Orientals, 1
value, 1
only, 1
two, 1
things--the, 1
fine, 1
breeding, 1
of, 1
their, 1
horses, 1
and, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
their, 1
women.", 1
"Nay,, 1

the, 1
baroness,, 1

would, 1
have, 1

somewhat, 1
more, 1
gallant, 1
to, 1
have, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
first.", 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
madame,, 1
how, 1
rightly, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
when, 1
I, 1
said, 1
I, 1
required, 1
a, 1
preceptor, 1
to, 1
guide, 1
me, 1
in, 1
all, 1
my, 1
sayings, 1

here.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
favorite, 1
attendant, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
boudoir;, 1
approaching, 1
her, 1
mistress,, 1
she, 1
spoke, 1
some, 1
words, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
turned, 1
very, 1
pale,, 1
then, 1
exclaimed,--"I, 1
cannot, 1
believe, 1
it;, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
impossible.", 1
"I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
woman,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
said.", 1
Turning, 1
impatiently, 1
towards, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
demanded,, 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
true?", 1
"Is, 1
what, 1
true,, 1
madame?", 1
inquired, 1
Danglars,, 1
visibly, 1
agitated., 1
"What, 1
my, 1
maid, 1
tells, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
does, 1
she, 1
tell, 1
you?", 1
"That, 1
when, 1
my, 1
coachman, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
harness, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
to, 1
my, 1
carriage,, 1
he, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
removed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
stables, 1
without, 1
his, 1
knowledge., 1
I, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
this?", 1
"Be, 1
kind, 1
enough,, 1
madame,, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
listen,, 1
monsieur,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
most, 1
curious, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
what, 1
explanation, 1
you, 1
will, 1
give., 1
These, 1
two, 1
gentlemen, 1
shall, 1
decide, 1
between, 1
us;, 1
but,, 1
first,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
state, 1
the, 1
case, 1
to, 1
them., 1
Gentlemen,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"among, 1
the, 1
ten, 1
horses, 1
in, 1
the, 1
stables, 1
of, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars,, 1
are, 1
two, 1
that, 1
belong, 1
exclusively, 1
to, 1
me--a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
the, 1
handsomest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
spirited, 1
creatures, 1
to, 1
be, 1
found, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
But, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
give, 1
a, 1
further, 1
description,, 1
because, 1
to, 1
you, 1
my, 1
beautiful, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
dappled, 1
grays, 1
were, 1
well, 1
known., 1
Well,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
the, 1
loan, 1
of, 1
my, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
to-morrow, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Bois;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
my, 1
coachman, 1
goes, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
the, 1
grays, 1
from, 1
the, 1
stables, 1
they, 1
are, 1
gone--positively, 1
gone., 1
No, 1
doubt, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
has, 1
sacrificed, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
selfish, 1
consideration, 1
of, 1
gaining, 1
some, 1
thousands, 1
of, 1
paltry, 1
francs., 1
Oh,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
detestable, 1
crew, 1
they, 1
are,, 1
these, 1
mercenary, 1
speculators!", 1
"Madame,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
"the, 1
horses, 1
were, 1
not, 1
sufficiently, 1
quiet, 1
for, 1
you;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
scarcely, 1
four, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
made, 1
me, 1
extremely, 1
uneasy, 1
on, 1
your, 1
account.", 1
"Nonsense,", 1
retorted, 1
the, 1
baroness;, 1
"you, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
entertained, 1
any, 1
alarm, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
perfectly, 1
well, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
had, 1
for, 1
a, 1
month, 1
in, 1
my, 1
service, 1
the, 1
very, 1
best, 1
coachman, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
But,, 1
perhaps,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
disposed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
horses?", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
love,, 1
pray, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
any, 1
more, 1
about, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
another, 1
pair, 1
exactly, 1
like, 1
them, 1
in, 1
appearance,, 1
only, 1
more, 1
quiet, 1
and, 1
steady.", 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
shrugged, 1
her, 1
shoulders, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
ineffable, 1
contempt,, 1
while, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
affecting, 1
not, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
this, 1
unconjugal, 1
gesture,, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
said,--"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
sorry, 1
not, 1
to, 1
have, 1
met, 1
you, 1
sooner., 1
You, 1
are, 1
setting, 1
up, 1
an, 1
establishment,, 1
of, 1
course?", 1
"Why,, 1
yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
liked, 1
to, 1
have, 1
made, 1
you, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
of, 1
these, 1
horses., 1
I, 1
have, 1
almost, 1
given, 1
them, 1
away,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
is;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
before, 1
said,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
get, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
them, 1
upon, 1
any, 1
terms., 1
They, 1
were, 1
only, 1
fit, 1
for, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
much, 1
obliged, 1
by, 1
your, 1
kind, 1
intentions, 1
towards, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"but, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
I, 1
purchased, 1
a, 1
very, 1
excellent, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
carriage-horses,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
they, 1
were, 1
dear., 1
There, 1
they, 1
are., 1
Come,, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
connoisseur,, 1

your, 1
opinion, 1
upon, 1

As, 1
Debray, 1
walked, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
Danglars, 1
approached, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
"I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
before, 1
others,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
"the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
my, 1
parting, 1
with, 1
the, 1
horses;, 1

a, 1
most, 1
enormous, 1
price, 1
was, 1
offered, 1
me, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
for, 1
them., 1
Some, 1
madman, 1

fool,, 1

himself, 1

fast, 1
as, 1
he, 1
can,, 1
actually, 1
sent, 1
his, 1
steward, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
them, 1
at, 1
any, 1
cost;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
gained, 1
16,000, 1
francs, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sale, 1
of, 1
them., 1
Come,, 1
don't, 1
look, 1
so, 1
angry,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
4,000, 1
francs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
money, 1
to, 1
do, 1
what, 1
you, 1
like, 1
with,, 1
and, 1
Eugenie, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
2,000., 1
There,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
now, 1
of, 1
the, 1
affair?, 1
Wasn't, 1
I, 1
right, 1
to, 1
part, 1
with, 1
the, 1
horses?", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
surveyed, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
withering, 1
contempt., 1
"Great, 1
heavens?", 1
suddenly, 1
exclaimed, 1
Debray., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
mistaken;, 1
there, 1
are, 1
your, 1
horses!, 1
The, 1
very, 1
animals, 1
we, 1
were, 1
speaking, 1
of,, 1
harnessed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
carriage!", 1
"My, 1
dappled, 1
grays?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
springing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window., 1
"'Tis, 1
indeed, 1
they!", 1
said, 1
she., 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
absolutely, 1
stupefied., 1
"How, 1
very, 1
singular,", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
well-feigned, 1
astonishment., 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
believe, 1
it,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
banker., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
whispered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ear, 1
of, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
approached, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
saying,, 1
"The, 1
baroness, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
you, 1
paid, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
for, 1
the, 1
horses.", 1
"I, 1
scarcely, 1
know,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
little, 1
surprise, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
me, 1
by, 1
my, 1
steward,, 1
and, 1
cost, 1
me--well,, 1
somewhere, 1
about, 1
30,000, 1
francs.", 1
Debray, 1
conveyed, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
Poor, 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
so, 1
crest-fallen, 1
and, 1
discomfited, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
assumed, 1
a, 1
pitying, 1
air, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
"See,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"how, 1
very, 1
ungrateful, 1
women, 1
are., 1
Your, 1
kind, 1
attention,, 1
in, 1
providing, 1
for, 1
the, 1
safety, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
by, 1
disposing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horses,, 1
does, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
have, 1
made, 1
the, 1
least, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
her., 1
But, 1
so, 1
it, 1
is;, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
will, 1
often,, 1
from, 1
mere, 1
wilfulness,, 1
prefer, 1
that, 1
which, 1
is, 1
dangerous, 1
to, 1
that, 1
which, 1
is, 1
safe., 1
Therefore,, 1
in, 1
my, 1
opinion,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
baron,, 1
the, 1
best, 1
and, 1
easiest, 1
way, 1
is, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
them, 1
to, 1
their, 1
fancies,, 1
and, 1
allow, 1
them, 1
to, 1
act, 1
as, 1
they, 1
please,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
any, 1
mischief, 1
follows,, 1
why,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
no, 1
one, 1
to, 1
blame, 1
but, 1
themselves.", 1
Danglars, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
anticipations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coming, 1
scene, 1
between, 1
himself, 1
and, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
whose, 1
frowning, 1
brow,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Olympic, 1
Jove,, 1
predicted, 1
a, 1
storm., 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
perceived, 1
the, 1
gathering, 1
clouds,, 1
and, 1
felt, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
explosion, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
rage,, 1
suddenly, 1
recollected, 1
an, 1
appointment,, 1
which, 1
compelled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
take, 1
his, 1
leave;, 1
while, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
unwilling, 1
by, 1
prolonging, 1
his, 1
stay, 1
to, 1
destroy, 1
the, 1
advantages, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
obtain,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
farewell, 1
bow, 1
and, 1
departed,, 1
leaving, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
angry, 1
reproaches, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
"Excellent,", 1
murmured, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
came, 1
away., 1
"All, 1
has, 1
gone, 1
according, 1
to, 1
my, 1
wishes., 1
The, 1
domestic, 1
peace, 1
of, 1
this, 1
family, 1
is, 1
henceforth, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands., 1
Now,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
play, 1
another, 1
master-stroke,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
gain, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
both, 1
husband, 1
and, 1
wife--delightful!, 1
Still,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
"amid, 1
all, 1
this,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
been, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
Danglars,, 1
whose, 1
acquaintance, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
make., 1
But,", 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
with, 1
his, 1
peculiar, 1
smile,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
here, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
plenty, 1
of, 1
time, 1
before, 1
me--by, 1
and, 1
by, 1
will, 1
do, 1
for, 1
that.", 1
With, 1
these, 1
reflections, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
home., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
afterwards,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
received, 1
a, 1
most, 1
flattering, 1
epistle, 1
from, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
entreated, 1
her, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
back, 1
her, 1
favorite, 1
"dappled, 1
grays,", 1
protesting, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
making, 1
his, 1
entry, 1
into, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
world, 1
of, 1
fashion, 1
with, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
that, 1
his, 1
splendid, 1
equipage, 1
had, 1
been, 1
obtained, 1
at, 1
the, 1
price, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
woman's, 1
regrets., 1
The, 1
horses, 1
were, 1
sent, 1
back, 1
wearing, 1
the, 1
same, 1
harness, 1
she, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
them, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning;, 1
only,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
orders,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
each, 1
rosette, 1
that, 1
adorned, 1
either, 1
side, 1
of, 1
their, 1
heads,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
fastened, 1
a, 1
large, 1
diamond., 1
To, 1
Danglars, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
also, 1
wrote,, 1
requesting, 1
him, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1
the, 1
whimsical, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
a, 1
capricious, 1
millionaire,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
beg, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
to, 1
pardon, 1
the, 1
Eastern, 1
fashion, 1
adopted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horses., 1
During, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
quitted, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
Auteuil,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Ali., 1
The, 1
following, 1
day,, 1
about, 1
three, 1
o'clock,, 1
a, 1
single, 1
blow, 1
struck, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gong, 1
summoned, 1
Ali, 1
to, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Ali,", 1
observed, 1
his, 1
master,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Nubian, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
chamber,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
frequently, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
me, 1
how, 1
more, 1
than, 1
commonly, 1
skilful, 1
you, 1
are, 1
in, 1
throwing, 1
the, 1
lasso,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
Ali, 1
drew, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
proudly,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative., 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
mistake., 1
With, 1
your, 1
lasso, 1
you, 1
could, 1
stop, 1
an, 1
ox?", 1
Again, 1
Ali, 1
repeated, 1
his, 1
affirmative, 1
gesture., 1
"Or, 1
a, 1
tiger?", 1
Ali, 1
bowed, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
assent., 1
"A, 1
lion, 1
even?", 1
Ali, 1
sprung, 1
forwards,, 1
imitating, 1
the, 1
action, 1
of, 1
one, 1
throwing, 1
the, 1
lasso,, 1
then, 1
of, 1
a, 1
strangled, 1
lion., 1
"I, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
you, 1
have, 1
hunted, 1
the, 1
lion?", 1
Ali, 1
smiled, 1
with, 1
triumphant, 1
pride, 1
as, 1
he, 1
signified, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
indeed, 1
both, 1
chased, 1
and, 1
captured, 1
many, 1
lions., 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
could, 1
arrest, 1
the, 1
progress, 1
of, 1
two, 1
horses, 1
rushing, 1
forwards, 1
with, 1
ungovernable, 1
fury?", 1
The, 1
Nubian, 1
smiled., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Then, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me., 1
Ere, 1
long, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
will, 1
dash, 1
past, 1
here,, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
the, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
dappled, 1
gray, 1
horses, 1
you, 1
saw, 1
me, 1
with, 1
yesterday;, 1
now,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
your, 1
own, 1
life,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
manage, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
those, 1
horses, 1
before, 1
my, 1
door.", 1
Ali, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
and, 1
marked, 1
a, 1
straight, 1
line, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pavement, 1
immediately, 1
at, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
the, 1
line, 1
he, 1
had, 1
traced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
watching, 1
him., 1
The, 1
count, 1
patted, 1
him, 1
gently, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shoulder,, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
praising, 1
Ali,, 1
who,, 1
pleased, 1
and, 1
gratified, 1
with, 1
the, 1
commission, 1
assigned, 1
him,, 1
walked, 1
calmly, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
projecting, 1
stone, 1
forming, 1
the, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street, 1
and, 1
house,, 1
and,, 1
seating, 1
himself, 1
thereon,, 1
began, 1
to, 1
smoke, 1
his, 1
chibouque,, 1
while, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
re-entered, 1
his, 1
dwelling,, 1
perfectly, 1
assured, 1
of, 1
the, 1
success, 1
of, 1
his, 1
plan., 1
Still,, 1
as, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
approached,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
momentarily, 1
expected, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
the, 1
indication, 1
of, 1
more, 1
than, 1
common, 1
impatience, 1
and, 1
uneasiness, 1
might, 1
be, 1
observed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
manner., 1
He, 1
stationed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
room, 1
commanding, 1
a, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
with, 1
restless, 1
steps,, 1
stopping, 1
merely, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
approaching, 1
wheels,, 1
then, 1
to, 1
cast, 1
an, 1
anxious, 1
glance, 1
on, 1
Ali;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
regularity, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Nubian, 1
puffed, 1
forth, 1
the, 1
smoke, 1
of, 1
his, 1
chibouque, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
he, 1
at, 1
least, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
enjoyment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
favorite, 1
occupation., 1
Suddenly, 1
a, 1
distant, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
rapidly, 1
advancing, 1
wheels, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
appeared,, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
wild,, 1
ungovernable, 1
horses,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
terrified, 1
coachman, 1
strove, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
their, 1
furious, 1
speed., 1
In, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
was, 1
a, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
and, 1
a, 1
child, 1
of, 1
about, 1
seven, 1
or, 1
eight, 1
clasped, 1
in, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
arms., 1
Terror, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
deprived, 1
them, 1
even, 1
of, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
cry., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
creaked, 1
and, 1
rattled, 1
as, 1
it, 1
flew, 1
over, 1
the, 1
rough, 1
stones,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
obstacle, 1
under, 1
the, 1
wheels, 1
would, 1
have, 1
caused, 1
disaster;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
kept, 1
on, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
who, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
pass, 1
uttered, 1
cries, 1
of, 1
terror., 1
Ali, 1
suddenly, 1
cast, 1
aside, 1
his, 1
chibouque,, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
lasso, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
threw, 1
it, 1
so, 1
skilfully, 1
as, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
the, 1
forelegs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
near, 1
horse, 1
in, 1
its, 1
triple, 1
fold,, 1
and, 1
suffered, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
dragged, 1
on, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
steps, 1
by, 1
the, 1
violence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shock,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
animal, 1
fell, 1
over, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pole,, 1
which, 1
snapped,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
prevented, 1
the, 1
other, 1
horse, 1
from, 1
pursuing, 1
its, 1
way., 1
Gladly, 1
availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
this, 1
opportunity,, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
leaped, 1
from, 1
his, 1
box;, 1
but, 1
Ali, 1
had, 1
promptly, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
nostrils, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
horse,, 1
and, 1
held, 1
them, 1
in, 1
his, 1
iron, 1
grasp,, 1
till, 1
the, 1
beast,, 1
snorting, 1
with, 1
pain,, 1
sunk, 1
beside, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
All, 1
this, 1
was, 1
achieved, 1
in, 1
much, 1
less, 1
time, 1
than, 1
is, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
the, 1
recital., 1
The, 1
brief, 1
space, 1
had,, 1
however,, 1
been, 1
sufficient, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
servants,, 1
to, 1
rush, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
before, 1
which, 1
the, 1
accident, 1
had, 1
occurred,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
coachman, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
to, 1
take, 1
from, 1
it, 1
a, 1
lady, 1
who, 1
was, 1
convulsively, 1
grasping, 1
the, 1
cushions, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
she, 1
pressed, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bosom, 1
the, 1
young, 1
boy,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
consciousness., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
carried, 1
them, 1
both, 1
to, 1
the, 1
salon,, 1
and, 1
deposited, 1
them, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sofa., 1
"Compose, 1
yourself,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"all, 1
danger, 1
is, 1
over.", 1
The, 1
woman, 1
looked, 1
up, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
far, 1
more, 1
expressive, 1
than, 1
any, 1
entreaties, 1
could, 1
have, 1
been,, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
her, 1
child,, 1
who, 1
still, 1
continued, 1
insensible., 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
your, 1
alarms,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
carefully, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
occasion, 1
for, 1
uneasiness;, 1
your, 1
little, 1
charge, 1
has, 1
not, 1
received, 1
the, 1
least, 1
injury;, 1
his, 1
insensibility, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
terror,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
pass.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
so, 1
to, 1
tranquillize, 1
my, 1
fears?, 1
See, 1
how, 1
deadly, 1
pale, 1
he, 1
is!, 1
My, 1
child,, 1
my, 1
darling, 1
Edward;, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
your, 1
mother--open, 1
your, 1
dear, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
look, 1
on, 1
me, 1
once, 1
again!, 1
Oh,, 1
sir,, 1
in, 1
pity, 1
send, 1
for, 1
a, 1
physician;, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
fortune, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
thought, 1
too, 1
much, 1
for, 1
the, 1
recovery, 1
of, 1
my, 1
boy.", 1
With, 1
a, 1
calm, 1
smile, 1
and, 1
a, 1
gentle, 1
wave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
distracted, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
lay, 1
aside, 1
her, 1
apprehensions;, 1
then,, 1
opening, 1
a, 1
casket, 1
that, 1
stood, 1
near,, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
forth, 1
a, 1
phial, 1
of, 1
Bohemian, 1
glass, 1
incrusted, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
containing, 1
a, 1
liquid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
color, 1
of, 1
blood,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
a, 1
single, 1
drop, 1
on, 1
the, 1
child's, 1
lips., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
it, 1
reached, 1
them,, 1
ere, 1
the, 1
boy,, 1
though, 1
still, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
marble,, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
eagerly, 1
gazed, 1
around, 1
him., 1
At, 1
this,, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mother, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
frantic., 1
"Where, 1
am, 1
I?", 1
exclaimed, 1
she;, 1
"and, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
am, 1
I, 1
indebted, 1
for, 1
so, 1
happy, 1
a, 1
termination, 1
to, 1
my, 1
late, 1
dreadful, 1
alarm?", 1
"Madame,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
under, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
one, 1
who, 1
esteems, 1
himself, 1
most, 1
fortunate, 1
in, 1
having, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
save, 1
you, 1
from, 1
a, 1
further, 1
continuance, 1
of, 1
your, 1
sufferings.", 1
"My, 1
wretched, 1
curiosity, 1
has, 1
brought, 1
all, 1
this, 1
about,", 1
pursued, 1
the, 1
lady., 1
"All, 1
Paris, 1
rung, 1
with, 1
the, 1
praises, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
beautiful, 1
horses,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
folly, 1
to, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
they, 1
really, 1
merited, 1
the, 1
high, 1
praise, 1
given, 1
to, 1
them.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
well-feigned, 1
astonishment,, 1
"that, 1
these, 1
horses, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness?", 1
"They, 1
do,, 1
indeed., 1
May, 1
I, 1
inquire, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
that, 1
honor;, 1
and, 1
my, 1
happiness, 1
at, 1
your, 1
escape, 1
from, 1
the, 1
danger, 1
that, 1
threatened, 1
you, 1
is, 1
redoubled, 1
by, 1
the, 1
consciousness, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
unwilling, 1
and, 1
the, 1
unintentional, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
peril, 1
you, 1
have, 1
incurred., 1
I, 1
yesterday, 1
purchased, 1
these, 1
horses, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baron;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
evidently, 1
regretted, 1
parting, 1
with, 1
them,, 1
I, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
send, 1
them, 1
back, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
request, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
gratify, 1
me, 1
by, 1
accepting, 1
them, 1
from, 1
my, 1
hands.", 1
"You, 1
are,, 1
then,, 1
doubtless,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
Hermine, 1
has, 1
talked, 1
to, 1
me, 1
so, 1
much?", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
rightly, 1
guessed,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
am, 1
Madame, 1
Heloise, 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
person, 1
who, 1
hears, 1
a, 1
name, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time., 1
"How, 1
grateful, 1
will, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
be, 1
for, 1
all, 1
your, 1
goodness;, 1
how, 1
thankfully, 1
will, 1
he, 1
acknowledge, 1
that, 1
to, 1
you, 1
alone, 1
he, 1
owes, 1
the, 1
existence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
child!, 1
Most, 1
certainly,, 1

for, 1
the, 1
prompt, 1
assistance, 1
of, 1
your, 1
intrepid, 1
servant,, 1
this, 1
dear, 1
child, 1

myself, 1
must, 1
both, 1
have, 1
perished.", 1
"Indeed,, 1
I, 1
still, 1
shudder, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fearful, 1
danger, 1
you, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
in.", 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
you, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
recompense, 1
worthily, 1
the, 1
devotion, 1
of, 1
your, 1
man.", 1
"I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"not, 1
to, 1
spoil, 1
Ali,, 1
either, 1
by, 1
too, 1
great, 1
praise, 1

me.", 1
"Nay,", 1
interposed, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
authoritative, 1
style, 1
adopted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
made, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
impression,, 1

mine,, 1

for, 1
my, 1
having, 1
myself, 1
saved, 1
him, 1
from, 1
death.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
made, 1
no, 1
further, 1
reply;, 1
her, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
utterly, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
contemplation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
first, 1
instant, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
him,, 1
had, 1
made, 1
so, 1
powerful, 1
an, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
her., 1
During, 1
the, 1
evident, 1
preoccupation, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
scrutinized, 1
the, 1
features, 1
and, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
she, 1
kept, 1
folded, 1
in, 1
her, 1
arms,, 1
lavishing, 1
on, 1
him, 1
the, 1
most, 1
tender, 1
endearments., 1
The, 1
child, 1
was, 1
small, 1
for, 1
his, 1
age,, 1
and, 1
unnaturally, 1
pale., 1
A, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
straight, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
defying, 1
all, 1
attempts, 1
to, 1
train, 1
or, 1
curl, 1
it,, 1
fell, 1
over, 1
his, 1
projecting, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
hung, 1
down, 1
to, 1
his, 1
shoulders,, 1
giving, 1
increased, 1
vivacity, 1
to, 1
eyes, 1
already, 1
sparkling, 1
with, 1
a, 1
youthful, 1
love, 1
of, 1
mischief, 1
and, 1
fondness, 1
for, 1
every, 1
forbidden, 1
enjoyment., 1
His, 1
mouth, 1
was, 1
large,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lips,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
regained, 1
their, 1
color,, 1
were, 1
particularly, 1
thin;, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
deep, 1
and, 1
crafty, 1
look,, 1
giving, 1
a, 1
predominant, 1
expression, 1
to, 1
the, 1
child's, 1
face,, 1
belonged, 1
rather, 1
to, 1
a, 1
boy, 1
of, 1
twelve, 1
or, 1
fourteen, 1
than, 1
to, 1
one, 1
so, 1
young., 1
His, 1
first, 1
movement, 1
was, 1
to, 1
free, 1
himself, 1
by, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
push, 1
from, 1
the, 1
encircling, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
rush, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
the, 1
casket, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
of, 1
elixir;, 1
then,, 1
without, 1
asking, 1
permission, 1
of, 1
any, 1
one,, 1
he, 1
proceeded,, 1
in, 1
all, 1
the, 1
wilfulness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
spoiled, 1
child, 1
unaccustomed, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
either, 1
whims, 1
or, 1
caprices,, 1
to, 1
pull, 1
the, 1
corks, 1
out, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
bottles., 1
"Touch, 1
nothing,, 1
my, 1
little, 1
friend,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
count, 1
eagerly;, 1
"some, 1
of, 1
those, 1
liquids, 1
are, 1
not, 1
only, 1
dangerous, 1
to, 1
taste,, 1
but, 1
even, 1
to, 1
inhale.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
became, 1
very, 1
pale,, 1
and,, 1
seizing, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
arm,, 1
drew, 1
him, 1
anxiously, 1
toward, 1
her;, 1
but,, 1
once, 1
satisfied, 1
of, 1
his, 1
safety,, 1
she, 1
also, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
but, 1
expressive, 1
glance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
casket,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
lost, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
count., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Ali, 1
entered., 1
At, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
uttered, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
pleasure,, 1
and,, 1
holding, 1
the, 1
child, 1
still, 1
closer, 1
towards, 1
her,, 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"Edward,, 1
dearest,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
see, 1
that, 1
good, 1
man?, 1
He, 1
has, 1
shown, 1
very, 1
great, 1
courage, 1
and, 1
resolution,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
exposed, 1
his, 1
own, 1
life, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
that, 1
were, 1
running, 1
away, 1
with, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
certainly, 1
have, 1
dashed, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
pieces., 1
Thank, 1
him,, 1
then,, 1
my, 1
child,, 1
in, 1
your, 1
very, 1
best, 1
manner;, 1
for,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
not, 1
come, 1
to, 1
our, 1
aid,, 1
neither, 1
you, 1
nor, 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
alive, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
our, 1
thanks.", 1
The, 1
child, 1
stuck, 1
out, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
a, 1
disdainful, 1
manner,, 1
saying,, 1
"He's, 1
too, 1
ugly.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
smiled, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
child, 1
bade, 1
fair, 1
to, 1
realize, 1
his, 1
hopes,, 1
while, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
reprimanded, 1
her, 1
son, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gentleness, 1
and, 1
moderation, 1
very, 1
far, 1
from, 1
conveying, 1
the, 1
least, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fault, 1
having, 1
been, 1
committed., 1
"This, 1
lady,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count,, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Arabic, 1
language,, 1
"is, 1
desirous, 1
that, 1
her, 1

but, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
refuses,, 1

ugly.", 1
Ali, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
intelligent, 1
countenance, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
boy,, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
without, 1
any, 1
apparent, 1
emotion;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
spasmodic, 1
working, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nostrils, 1
showed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
practiced, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Arab, 1
had, 1
been, 1
wounded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
inquire,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
arose, 1
to, 1
take, 1
her, 1
leave,, 1
"whether, 1
you, 1
usually, 1
reside, 1
here?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1

addressing, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smiling, 1
air,, 1
"will, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
driving, 1
you, 1
home,, 1
while, 1
your, 1
coachman, 1
remains, 1
here, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
to, 1
the, 1
necessary, 1
repairs, 1
of, 1
your, 1
calash., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
that, 1
important, 1
business, 1
is, 1
concluded,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
have, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
my, 1
own, 1
horses, 1
harnessed, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
it, 1
direct, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars.", 1
"I, 1
dare, 1
not, 1
return, 1
with, 1
those, 1
dreadful, 1
horses,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
see,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that, 1
they, 1
will, 1
be, 1
as, 1
different, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Ali., 1
With, 1
him, 1
they, 1
will, 1
be, 1
gentle, 1
and, 1
docile, 1
as, 1
lambs.", 1
Ali, 1
had,, 1
indeed,, 1
given, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
this;, 1
for,, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
animals,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
got, 1
upon, 1
their, 1
legs, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
difficulty,, 1
he, 1
rubbed, 1
their, 1
foreheads, 1
and, 1
nostrils, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sponge, 1
soaked, 1
in, 1
aromatic, 1
vinegar,, 1
and, 1
wiped, 1
off, 1
the, 1
sweat, 1
and, 1
foam, 1
that, 1
covered, 1
their, 1
mouths., 1
Then,, 1
commencing, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
whistling, 1
noise,, 1
he, 1
rubbed, 1
them, 1
well, 1
all, 1
over, 1
their, 1
bodies, 1
for, 1
several, 1
minutes;, 1
then,, 1
undisturbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
noisy, 1
crowd, 1
collected, 1
round, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
carriage,, 1
Ali, 1
quietly, 1
harnessed, 1
the, 1
pacified, 1
animals, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
chariot,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
reins, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
mounted, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
when, 1
to, 1
the, 1
utter, 1
astonishment, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
witnessed, 1
the, 1
ungovernable, 1
spirit, 1
and, 1
maddened, 1
speed, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
horses,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
actually, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
apply, 1
his, 1
whip, 1
in, 1
no, 1
very, 1
gentle, 1
manner, 1
before, 1
he, 1
could, 1
induce, 1
them, 1
to, 1
start;, 1
and, 1
even, 1
then, 1
all, 1
that, 1
could, 1
be, 1
obtained, 1
from, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
"dappled, 1
grays,", 1
now, 1
changed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
couple, 1
of, 1
dull,, 1
sluggish,, 1
stupid, 1
brutes,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
slow,, 1
pottering, 1
pace,, 1
kept, 1
up, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
difficulty, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
more, 1
than, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
her, 1
residence, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Honore., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
the, 1
first, 1
congratulations, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
marvellous, 1
escape, 1
been, 1
gone, 1
through, 1
when, 1
she, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
following, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars:--, 1
Dear, 1
Hermine,--I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
had, 1
a, 1
wonderful, 1
escape, 1
from, 1
the, 1
most, 1
imminent, 1
danger,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
my, 1
safety, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
we, 1
were, 1
talking, 1
about, 1
yesterday,, 1
but, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
little, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
see, 1
to-day., 1
I, 1
remember, 1
how, 1
unmercifully, 1
I, 1
laughed, 1
at, 1
what, 1
I, 1
considered, 1
your, 1
eulogistic, 1
and, 1
exaggerated, 1
praises, 1
of, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
now, 1
ample, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
that, 1
your, 1
enthusiastic, 1
description, 1
of, 1
this, 1
wonderful, 1
man, 1
fell, 1
far, 1
short, 1
of, 1
his, 1
merits., 1
Your, 1
horses, 1
got, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
Ranelagh,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
darted, 1
forward, 1
like, 1
mad, 1
things,, 1
and, 1
galloped, 1
away, 1
at, 1
so, 1
fearful, 1
a, 1
rate,, 1
that, 1
there, 1
seemed, 1
no, 1
other, 1
prospect, 1
for, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
Edward, 1
but, 1
that, 1
of, 1
being, 1
dashed, 1
to, 1
pieces, 1
against, 1
the, 1
first, 1
object, 1
that, 1
impeded, 1
their, 1
progress,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
strange-looking, 1
man,--an, 1
Arab,, 1
a, 1
negro,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
Nubian,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
black, 1
of, 1
some, 1
nation, 1
or, 1
other--at, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
from, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
whose, 1
domestic, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
suddenly, 1
seized, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
the, 1
infuriated, 1
animals,, 1
even, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1
trampled, 1
to, 1
death, 1
himself;, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
had, 1
a, 1
most, 1
wonderful, 1
escape., 1
The, 1
count, 1
then, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
us, 1
into, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
speedily, 1
recalled, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
Edward, 1
to, 1
life., 1
He, 1
sent, 1
us, 1
home, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
carriage., 1
Yours, 1
will, 1
be, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
you, 1
to-morrow., 1
You, 1
will, 1
find, 1
your, 1
horses, 1
in, 1
bad, 1
condition,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
results, 1
of, 1
this, 1
accident;, 1
they, 1
seem, 1
thoroughly, 1
stupefied,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
sulky, 1
and, 1
vexed, 1
at, 1
having, 1
been, 1
conquered, 1
by, 1
man., 1
The, 1
count,, 1
however,, 1
has, 1
commissioned, 1
me, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
that, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
days', 1
rest,, 1
with, 1
plenty, 1
of, 1
barley, 1
for, 1
their, 1
sole, 1
food, 1
during, 1
that, 1
time,, 1
will, 1
bring, 1
them, 1
back, 1
to, 1
as, 1
fine,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
as, 1
terrifying,, 1
a, 1
condition, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
in, 1
yesterday., 1
Adieu!, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
return, 1
you, 1
many, 1
thanks, 1
for, 1
the, 1
drive, 1
of, 1
yesterday;, 1
but,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
blame, 1
you, 1
for, 1
the, 1
misconduct, 1
of, 1
your, 1
horses,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
as, 1
it, 1
procured, 1
me, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
an, 1
introduction, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,--and, 1
certainly, 1
that, 1
illustrious, 1
personage,, 1
apart, 1
from, 1
the, 1
millions, 1
he, 1
is, 1
said, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so, 1
very, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
curiously, 1
interesting, 1
problems, 1
I,, 1
for, 1
one,, 1
delight, 1
in, 1
solving, 1
at, 1
any, 1
risk,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
to, 1
necessitate, 1
another, 1
drive, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Bois, 1
behind, 1
your, 1
horses., 1
Edward, 1
endured, 1
the, 1
accident, 1
with, 1
miraculous, 1
courage--he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
single, 1
cry,, 1
but, 1
fell, 1
lifeless, 1
into, 1
my, 1
arms;, 1
nor, 1
did, 1
a, 1
tear, 1
fall, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
after, 1
it, 1
was, 1
over., 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
not, 1
you, 1
will, 1
consider, 1
these, 1
praises, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
blind, 1
maternal, 1
affection,, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
soul, 1
of, 1
iron, 1
in, 1
that, 1
delicate,, 1
fragile, 1
body., 1
Valentine, 1
sends, 1
many, 1
affectionate, 1
remembrances, 1
to, 1
your, 1
dear, 1
Eugenie., 1
I, 1
embrace, 1
you, 1
with, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart., 1
Heloise, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
P.S.--Do, 1
pray, 1
contrive, 1
some, 1
means, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
your, 1
house., 1
I, 1
must, 1
and, 1
will, 1
see, 1
him, 1
again., 1
I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
made, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
call, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
will, 1
be, 1
returned., 1
That, 1
night, 1
the, 1
adventure, 1
at, 1
Auteuil, 1
was, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
everywhere., 1
Albert, 1
related, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother;, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
recounted, 1
it, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Jockey, 1
Club,, 1
and, 1
Debray, 1
detailed, 1
it, 1
at, 1
length, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salons, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister;, 1
even, 1
Beauchamp, 1
accorded, 1
twenty, 1
lines, 1
in, 1
his, 1
journal, 1
to, 1
the, 1
relation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
courage, 1
and, 1
gallantry,, 1
thereby, 1
celebrating, 1
him, 1
as, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
hero, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
feminine, 1
members, 1
of, 1
the, 1
aristocracy., 1
Vast, 1
was, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
visitors, 1
and, 1
inquiring, 1
friends, 1
who, 1
left, 1
their, 1
names, 1
at, 1
the, 1
residence, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
design, 1
of, 1
renewing, 1
their, 1
visit, 1
at, 1
the, 1
right, 1
moment,, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
from, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
all, 1
the, 1
interesting, 1
circumstances, 1
of, 1
this, 1
most, 1
romantic, 1
adventure., 1
As, 1
for, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
he, 1
fulfilled, 1
the, 1
predictions, 1
of, 1
Heloise, 1
to, 1
the, 1
letter,--donned, 1
his, 1
dress, 1
suit,, 1
drew, 1
on, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
white, 1
gloves,, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
their, 1
full, 1
livery,, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
that, 1
same, 1
night, 1
to, 1
No., 1
30, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Avenue, 1
des, 1
Champs-Elysees., 1
Chapter, 1
48., 1
Ideology., 1
If, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
been, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
familiar, 1
with, 1
the, 1
ways, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
society,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
appreciated, 1
better, 1
the, 1
significance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
step, 1
which, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
taken., 1
Standing, 1
well, 1
at, 1
court,, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
king, 1
regnant, 1
was, 1
of, 1
the, 1
older, 1
or, 1
younger, 1
branch,, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
government, 1
was, 1
doctrinaire, 1
liberal,, 1
or, 1
conservative;, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
by, 1
all, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
talent,, 1
since, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
never, 1
experienced, 1
a, 1
political, 1
check, 1
are, 1
generally, 1
so, 1
regarded;, 1
hated, 1
by, 1
many,, 1
but, 1
warmly, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
others,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
really, 1
liked, 1
by, 1
anybody,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
held, 1
a, 1
high, 1
position, 1
in, 1
the, 1
magistracy,, 1
and, 1
maintained, 1
his, 1
eminence, 1
like, 1
a, 1
Harlay, 1
or, 1
a, 1
Mole., 1
His, 1
drawing-room,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
regenerating, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
a, 1
daughter, 1
by, 1
his, 1
first, 1
marriage,, 1
scarcely, 1
eighteen,, 1
was, 1
still, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
well-regulated, 1
Paris, 1
salons, 1
where, 1
the, 1
worship, 1
of, 1
traditional, 1
customs, 1
and, 1
the, 1
observance, 1
of, 1
rigid, 1
etiquette, 1
were, 1
carefully, 1
maintained., 1
A, 1
freezing, 1
politeness,, 1
a, 1
strict, 1
fidelity, 1
to, 1
government, 1
principles,, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
contempt, 1
for, 1
theories, 1
and, 1
theorists,, 1
a, 1
deep-seated, 1
hatred, 1
of, 1
ideality,--these, 1
were, 1
the, 1
elements, 1
of, 1
private, 1
and, 1
public, 1
life, 1
displayed, 1
by, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
only, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
diplomatist., 1
His, 1
relations, 1
with, 1
the, 1
former, 1
court,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
always, 1
spoke, 1
with, 1
dignity, 1
and, 1
respect,, 1
made, 1
him, 1
respected, 1
by, 1
the, 1
new, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
so, 1
many, 1
things,, 1
that, 1
not, 1
only, 1
was, 1
he, 1
always, 1
carefully, 1
considered,, 1
but, 1
sometimes, 1
consulted., 1
Perhaps, 1
this, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
had, 1
it, 1
been, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
get, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
but,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
feudal, 1
barons, 1
who, 1
rebelled, 1
against, 1
their, 1
sovereign,, 1
he, 1
dwelt, 1
in, 1
an, 1
impregnable, 1
fortress., 1
This, 1
fortress, 1
was, 1
his, 1
post, 1
as, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
advantages, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
exploited, 1
with, 1
marvellous, 1
skill,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
resigned, 1
but, 1
to, 1
be, 1
made, 1
deputy,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
replace, 1
neutrality, 1
by, 1
opposition., 1
Ordinarily, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
made, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
very, 1
few, 1
visits., 1
His, 1
wife, 1
visited, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
received, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
weighty, 1
and, 1
multifarious, 1
occupations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
were, 1
accepted, 1
as, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
for, 1
what, 1
was, 1
really, 1
only, 1
calculated, 1
pride,, 1
a, 1
manifestation, 1
of, 1
professed, 1
superiority--in, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
application, 1
of, 1
the, 1
axiom,, 1
"Pretend, 1
to, 1
think, 1
well, 1
of, 1
yourself,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
world, 1
will, 1
think, 1
well, 1
of, 1
you,", 1
an, 1
axiom, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times, 1
more, 1
useful, 1
in, 1
society, 1
nowadays, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Greeks,, 1
"Know, 1
thyself,", 1
a, 1
knowledge, 1
for, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
our, 1
days,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
substituted, 1
the, 1
less, 1
difficult, 1
and, 1
more, 1
advantageous, 1
science, 1
of, 1
knowing, 1
others., 1
To, 1
his, 1
friends, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
protector;, 1
to, 1
his, 1
enemies,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
silent,, 1
but, 1
bitter, 1
opponent;, 1
for, 1
those, 1
who, 1
were, 1
neither, 1
the, 1
one, 1
nor, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
statue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law-made, 1
man., 1
He, 1
had, 1
a, 1
haughty, 1
bearing,, 1
a, 1
look, 1
either, 1
steady, 1
and, 1
impenetrable, 1
or, 1
insolently, 1
piercing, 1
and, 1
inquisitorial., 1
Four, 1
successive, 1
revolutions, 1
had, 1
built, 1
and, 1
cemented, 1
the, 1
pedestal, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
was, 1
based., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
the, 1
reputation, 1
of, 1
being, 1
the, 1
least, 1
curious, 1
and, 1
the, 1
least, 1
wearisome, 1
man, 1
in, 1
France., 1
He, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
ball, 1
every, 1
year,, 1
at, 1
which, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
for, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
only,--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
five, 1
and, 1
forty, 1
minutes, 1
less, 1
than, 1
the, 1
king, 1
is, 1
visible, 1
at, 1
his, 1
balls., 1
He, 1
was, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
theatres,, 1
at, 1
concerts,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
any, 1
place, 1
of, 1
public, 1
resort., 1
Occasionally,, 1
but, 1
seldom,, 1
he, 1
played, 1
at, 1
whist,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
care, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
select, 1
partners, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
him--sometimes, 1
they, 1
were, 1
ambassadors,, 1
sometimes, 1
archbishops,, 1
or, 1
sometimes, 1
a, 1
prince,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
president,, 1
or, 1
some, 1
dowager, 1
duchess., 1
Such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
carriage, 1
had, 1
just, 1
now, 1
stopped, 1
before, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
door., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
announced, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
leaning, 1
over, 1
a, 1
large, 1
table,, 1
was, 1
tracing, 1
on, 1
a, 1
map, 1
the, 1
route, 1
from, 1
St., 1
Petersburg, 1
to, 1
China., 1
The, 1
procureur, 1
entered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
grave, 1
and, 1
measured, 1
step, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
entering, 1
a, 1
court, 1
of, 1
justice., 1
He, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
man,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
development, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
man,, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
have, 1
heretofore, 1
seen, 1
as, 1
assistant, 1
attorney, 1
at, 1
Marseilles., 1
Nature,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
her, 1
way,, 1
had, 1
made, 1
no, 1
deviation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
path, 1
he, 1
had, 1
marked, 1
out, 1
for, 1
himself., 1
From, 1
being, 1
slender, 1
he, 1
had, 1
now, 1
become, 1
meagre;, 1
once, 1
pale,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
now, 1
yellow;, 1
his, 1
deep-set, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
hollow,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gold, 1
spectacles, 1
shielding, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
an, 1
integral, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
face., 1
He, 1
dressed, 1
entirely, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
his, 1
white, 1
tie,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
funeral, 1
appearance, 1
was, 1
only, 1
mitigated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
slight, 1
line, 1
of, 1
red, 1
ribbon, 1
which, 1
passed, 1
almost, 1
imperceptibly, 1
through, 1
his, 1
button-hole,, 1
and, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
a, 1
streak, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
traced, 1
with, 1
a, 1
delicate, 1
brush., 1
Although, 1
master, 1
of, 1
himself,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
scrutinized, 1
with, 1
irrepressible, 1
curiosity, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
whose, 1
salute, 1
he, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
distrustful, 1
by, 1
habit,, 1
and, 1
especially, 1
incredulous, 1
as, 1
to, 1
social, 1
prodigies,, 1
was, 1
much, 1
more, 1
despised, 1
to, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
"the, 1
noble, 1
stranger,", 1
as, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
already, 1
called,, 1
as, 1
an, 1
adventurer, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
new, 1
fields,, 1
or, 1
an, 1
escaped, 1
criminal,, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
as, 1
a, 1
prince, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Holy, 1
See,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
sultan, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Thousand, 1
and, 1
One, 1
Nights., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
squeaky, 1
tone, 1
assumed, 1
by, 1
magistrates, 1
in, 1
their, 1
oratorical, 1
periods,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
which, 1
they, 1
cannot,, 1
or, 1
will, 1
not,, 1
divest, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
society,, 1
"sir,, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
service, 1
which, 1
you, 1
yesterday, 1
rendered, 1
to, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
son, 1
has, 1
made, 1
it, 1
a, 1
duty, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
my, 1
thanks., 1
I, 1
have, 1
come,, 1
therefore,, 1
to, 1
discharge, 1
this, 1
duty,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
express, 1
to, 1
you, 1
my, 1
overwhelming, 1
gratitude.", 1
And, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
the, 1
"eye, 1
severe", 1
of, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
its, 1
habitual, 1
arrogance., 1
He, 1
spoke, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur-general,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rigid, 1
inflexibility, 1
of, 1
neck, 1
and, 1
shoulders, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
his, 1
flatterers, 1
to, 1
say, 1
(as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
observed), 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
living, 1
statue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law., 1
"Monsieur,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
chilling, 1
air,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
preserving, 1
a, 1
son, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sentiment, 1
of, 1
maternity, 1
is, 1
the, 1
most, 1
holy, 1
of, 1
all;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
which, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
monsieur,, 1
might, 1
have, 1
enabled, 1
you, 1
to, 1
dispense, 1
with, 1
a, 1
duty, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
its, 1
discharge,, 1
confers, 1
an, 1
undoubtedly, 1
great, 1
honor;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
not, 1
usually, 1
lavish, 1
of, 1
the, 1
favor, 1
which, 1
he, 1
now, 1
bestows, 1
on, 1
me,--a, 1
favor, 1
which,, 1
however, 1
estimable,, 1
is, 1
unequal, 1
to, 1
the, 1
satisfaction, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
in, 1
my, 1
own, 1
consciousness.", 1
Villefort,, 1
astonished, 1
at, 1
this, 1
reply,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
expected,, 1
started, 1
like, 1
a, 1
soldier, 1
who, 1
feels, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
levelled, 1
at, 1
him, 1
over, 1
the, 1
armor, 1
he, 1
wears,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
curl, 1
of, 1
his, 1
disdainful, 1
lip, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
from, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
noted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tablets, 1
of, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
a, 1
highly, 1
bred, 1
gentleman., 1
He, 1
glanced, 1
around,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
seize, 1
on, 1
something, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
might, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
easily, 1
on, 1
a, 1
topic., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
map, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
been, 1
examining, 1
when, 1
he, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"You, 1
seem, 1
geographically, 1
engaged,, 1
sir?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
study, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
who,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
learn,, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
as, 1
many, 1
lands, 1
as, 1
are, 1
delineated, 1
on, 1
this, 1
map.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
make, 1
of, 1
the, 1
human, 1
race,, 1
taken, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mass,, 1
what, 1
you, 1
practice, 1
every, 1
day, 1
on, 1
individuals--a, 1
physiological, 1
study., 1
I, 1
have, 1
believed, 1
it, 1
was, 1
much, 1
easier, 1
to, 1
descend, 1
from, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
to, 1
a, 1
part, 1
than, 1
to, 1
ascend, 1
from, 1
a, 1
part, 1
to, 1
the, 1
whole., 1
It, 1
is, 1
an, 1
algebraic, 1
axiom,, 1
which, 1
makes, 1
us, 1
proceed, 1
from, 1
a, 1
known, 1
to, 1
an, 1
unknown, 1
quantity,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
from, 1
an, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
a, 1
known;, 1
but, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
move, 1
forwards, 1
himself,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count, 1
merely, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
into, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
kneeling, 1
when, 1
M., 1
Villefort, 1
entered., 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
halfway, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
visitor,, 1
having, 1
his, 1
back, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
his, 1
elbow, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
geographical, 1
chart, 1
which, 1
furnished, 1
the, 1
theme, 1
of, 1
conversation, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment,--a, 1
conversation, 1
which, 1
assumed,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
the, 1
case, 1
of, 1
the, 1
interviews, 1
with, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Morcerf,, 1
a, 1
turn, 1
analogous, 1
to, 1
the, 1
persons,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
to, 1
the, 1
situation., 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
philosophize,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wrestler, 1
who, 1
encounters, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
opponent,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
breath;, 1
"well,, 1
sir,, 1
really,, 1
if,, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
else, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
seek, 1
a, 1
more, 1
amusing, 1
occupation.", 1
"Why,, 1
in, 1
truth,, 1
sir,", 1
was, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
reply,, 1
"man, 1
is, 1
but, 1
an, 1
ugly, 1
caterpillar, 1
for, 1
him, 1
who, 1
studies, 1
him, 1
through, 1
a, 1
solar, 1
microscope;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
said,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
else, 1
to, 1
do., 1
Now,, 1
really,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
ask,, 1
sir,, 1
have, 1
you?--do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
have, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
do?, 1
or, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
in, 1
plain, 1
terms,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
really, 1
think, 1
that, 1
what, 1
you, 1
do, 1
deserves, 1
being, 1
called, 1
anything?", 1
Villefort's, 1
astonishment, 1
redoubled, 1
at, 1
this, 1
second, 1
thrust, 1
so, 1
forcibly, 1
made, 1
by, 1
his, 1
strange, 1
adversary., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
since, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
paradox, 1
so, 1
strong,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
to, 1
say, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
more, 1
exactly,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
it., 1
The, 1
procureur, 1
exerted, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
reply., 1
"Sir,", 1
he, 1
responded,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
stranger,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
you, 1
say, 1
yourself, 1
that, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
your, 1
life, 1
has, 1
been, 1
spent, 1
in, 1
Oriental, 1
countries,, 1
so, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
how, 1
human, 1
justice,, 1
so, 1
expeditious, 1
in, 1
barbarous, 1
countries,, 1
takes, 1
with, 1
us, 1
a, 1
prudent, 1
and, 1
well-studied, 1
course.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes--yes,, 1
I, 1
do,, 1
sir;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
pede, 1
claudo, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ancients., 1
I, 1
know, 1
all, 1
that,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
is, 1
with, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
of, 1
all, 1
countries, 1
especially, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
occupied, 1
myself--it, 1
is, 1
with, 1
the, 1
criminal, 1
procedure, 1
of, 1
all, 1
nations, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
compared, 1
natural, 1
justice,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
must, 1
say,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
law, 1
of, 1
primitive, 1
nations,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
the, 1
law, 1
of, 1
retaliation,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
most, 1
frequently, 1
found, 1
to, 1
be, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
law, 1
of, 1
God.", 1
"If, 1
this, 1
law, 1
were, 1
adopted,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
"it, 1
would, 1
greatly, 1
simplify, 1
our, 1
legal, 1
codes,, 1

in, 1
that, 1
case, 1
the, 1
magistrates, 1
would, 1
not, 1
(as, 1
you, 1
just, 1
observed), 1

much, 1
to, 1

"It, 1
may,, 1
perhaps,, 1
come, 1
to, 1
this, 1
in, 1
time,", 1
observed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"you, 1
know, 1

continued, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1

derived, 1
from, 1
Gallic, 1

"I, 1
agree, 1
with, 1
you, 1
entirely,, 1

all, 1
that, 1
even, 1
you, 1
know, 1
with, 1
respect, 1
to, 1
the, 1

The, 1
English,, 1
Turkish,, 1
Japanese,, 1
Hindu, 1
laws,, 1
are, 1
as, 1
familiar, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
the, 1
French, 1
laws,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
I, 1
was, 1
right,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
said, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
relatively, 1
(you, 1
know, 1
that, 1

relative,, 1

relatively, 1
to, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
very, 1
little, 1
to, 1

that, 1
relatively, 1

I, 1
have, 1

deal, 1
to, 1

"But, 1
with, 1
what, 1
motive, 1
have, 1
you, 1
learned, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
inquired, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
astonishment., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
smiled., 1
"Really,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
observed,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
reputation, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
acquired, 1
as, 1
a, 1
superior, 1
man,, 1
you, 1
look, 1
at, 1
everything, 1
from, 1
the, 1
material, 1

vulgar, 1
view, 1
of, 1
society,, 1
beginning, 1
with, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
ending, 1
with, 1
man--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
restricted,, 1
most, 1
narrow, 1
view, 1
which, 1
it, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
for, 1
human, 1
understanding, 1
to, 1
embrace.", 1
"Pray,, 1
sir,, 1
explain, 1
yourself,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
astonished,, 1
"I, 1
really, 1
do--not--understand, 1
you--perfectly.", 1
"I, 1
say,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
with, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
social, 1
organization, 1
of, 1

you, 1
see, 1
only, 1
the, 1
springs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
machine,, 1
and, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sublime, 1
workman, 1
who, 1
makes, 1
them, 1
act;, 1
I, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
before, 1
you, 1
and, 1
around, 1
you, 1
any, 1
but, 1
those, 1
office-holders, 1
whose, 1
commissions, 1
have, 1
been, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
minister, 1
or, 1
king;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
men, 1
whom, 1
God, 1
has, 1
put, 1
above, 1
those, 1
office-holders,, 1
ministers,, 1

kings,, 1

giving, 1
them, 1
a, 1
mission, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
out,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
a, 1
post, 1
to, 1
fill--I, 1
say, 1
that, 1
they, 1
escape, 1
your, 1
narrow,, 1
limited, 1
field, 1
of, 1
observation., 1
It, 1
is, 1
thus, 1
that, 1
human, 1
weakness, 1
fails,, 1
from, 1
its, 1
debilitated, 1
and, 1
imperfect, 1
organs., 1
Tobias, 1
took, 1
the, 1
angel, 1
who, 1
restored, 1
him, 1

light, 1
for, 1
an, 1
ordinary, 1
young, 1
man., 1

to, 1
destroy, 1
them,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
conqueror, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
other, 1
conquerors,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
necessary, 1
for, 1
both, 1
to, 1
reveal, 1
their, 1
missions,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
be, 1
known, 1
and, 1
acknowledged;, 1
one, 1
was, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
'I, 1

of, 1

Lord';, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
'I, 1

of, 1
God,', 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
the, 1
divine, 1
essence, 1
in, 1
both, 1
might, 1
be, 1
revealed.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
amazed,, 1
and, 1
really, 1
supposing, 1
he, 1
was, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
a, 1
mystic, 1
or, 1
a, 1
madman,, 1
"you, 1
consider, 1
yourself, 1

you, 1
have, 1

"And, 1
why, 1
not?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
coldly., 1
"Your, 1

Villefort,, 1
quite, 1
astounded,, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
will, 1
excuse, 1
me, 1
if,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
presented, 1
myself, 1

I, 1
was, 1

surpass, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
knowledge, 1

It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
usual, 1

you, 1

disinherited, 1
from, 1

"Really,, 1

retorted, 1
the, 1
count,, 1

my, 1
word,, 1

am, 1
a, 1
cosmopolite., 1
No, 1
country, 1
can, 1

Frenchman,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
speak, 1

Haidee,, 1
my, 1

You, 1
may,, 1
therefore,, 1
comprehend,, 1
that, 1
being, 1

country,, 1
asking, 1
no, 1

two, 1
conquerors,, 1

with, 1
perseverance, 1
I, 1
subdue, 1

them,--they, 1
are, 1
time, 1

distance., 1
There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
third,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1

is, 1
my, 1
condition, 1

a, 1
mortal, 1
being., 1
This, 1
alone, 1
can, 1
stop, 1
me, 1

my, 1
onward, 1
career,, 1

I, 1
aim,, 1

What, 1
men, 1
call, 1
the, 1
chances, 1
of, 1
fate--namely,, 1
ruin,, 1

circumstances--I, 1
have, 1
fully, 1

I, 1
shall, 1
always, 1
be, 1
what, 1

it, 1
is, 1
that, 1
I, 1
utter, 1
the, 1
things, 1

never, 1
heard,, 1
even, 1
from, 1

kings, 1
have, 1
need,, 1

fear, 1
of, 1
you., 1

Villefort, 1
with, 1
hesitation,, 1
"that, 1
human, 1
nature, 1
being, 1
weak,, 1
every, 1
man,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
your, 1
creed,, 1
has, 1
committed, 1
faults.", 1
"Faults, 1
or, 1
crimes,", 1
responded, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
negligent, 1
air., 1
"And, 1
that, 1
you, 1
alone,, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
men, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
as, 1
your, 1
brothers--for, 1
you, 1
have, 1
said, 1
so,", 1
observed, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
faltered, 1
somewhat--"you, 1
alone, 1
are, 1
perfect.", 1
"No,, 1
not, 1
perfect,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
reply;, 1
"only, 1
impenetrable,, 1
that's, 1
all., 1
But, 1
let, 1
us, 1
leave, 1
off, 1
this, 1
strain,, 1
sir,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
it, 1
is, 1
displeasing, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
more, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
your, 1
justice, 1
than, 1
are, 1
you, 1
by, 1
my, 1
second-sight.", 1
"No,, 1
no,--by, 1
no, 1
means,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
abandon, 1
his, 1
ground., 1
"No;, 1
by, 1
your, 1
brilliant, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
sublime, 1
conversation, 1
you, 1
have, 1
elevated, 1
me, 1
above, 1
the, 1
ordinary, 1
level;, 1
we, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
talk,, 1
we, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
dissertation., 1
But, 1
you, 1
know, 1
how, 1
the, 1
theologians, 1
in, 1
their, 1
collegiate, 1
chairs,, 1
and, 1
philosophers, 1
in, 1
their, 1
controversies,, 1
occasionally, 1
say, 1
cruel, 1
truths;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
suppose, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
we, 1
are, 1
theologizing, 1
in, 1
a, 1
social, 1
way,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
philosophically,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
say, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
rude, 1
as, 1
it, 1
may, 1
seem,, 1
'My, 1
brother,, 1
you, 1
sacrifice, 1
greatly, 1
to, 1
pride;, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be, 1
above, 1
others,, 1
but, 1
above, 1
you, 1
there, 1
is, 1
God.'", 1
"Above, 1
us, 1
all,, 1
sir,", 1
was, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
response,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
emphasis, 1
so, 1
deep, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
involuntarily, 1
shuddered., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
my, 1
pride, 1
for, 1
men--serpents, 1
always, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
threaten, 1
every, 1
one, 1
who, 1
would, 1
pass, 1
without, 1
crushing, 1
them, 1
under, 1
foot., 1
But, 1
I, 1
lay, 1
aside, 1
that, 1
pride, 1
before, 1
God,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
me, 1
from, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am.", 1
"Then,, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
admire, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
who,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
in, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
conversation,, 1
used, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
form, 1
to, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
personage,, 1
whom,, 1
until, 1
now,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
called, 1
monsieur., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
say, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
strong,, 1
really, 1
superior,, 1
really, 1
pious,, 1
or, 1
impenetrable,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
were, 1
right, 1
in, 1
saying, 1
amounts, 1
to, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing--then, 1
be, 1
proud,, 1
sir,, 1
for, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
characteristic, 1
of, 1
predominance., 1
Yet, 1
you, 1
have, 1
unquestionably, 1
some, 1
ambition.", 1
"I, 1
have,, 1
sir.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
may, 1
it, 1
be?", 1
"I, 1
too,, 1
as, 1
happens, 1
to, 1
every, 1
man, 1
once, 1
in, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
by, 1
Satan, 1
into, 1
the, 1
highest, 1
mountain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
there, 1
he, 1
showed, 1
me, 1
all, 1
the, 1
kingdoms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said, 1
before,, 1
so, 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
'Child, 1
of, 1
earth,, 1
what, 1
wouldst, 1
thou, 1
have, 1
to, 1
make, 1
thee, 1
adore, 1
me?', 1
I, 1
reflected, 1
long,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
gnawing, 1
ambition, 1
had, 1
long, 1
preyed, 1
upon, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
replied,, 1
'Listen,--I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
providence,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
anything, 1
that, 1
resembles, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
which, 1
can, 1
make, 1
me, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
he, 1
exists., 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
providence, 1
myself,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
the, 1
most, 1
beautiful,, 1
noblest,, 1
most, 1
sublime, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
is, 1
to, 1
recompense, 1
and, 1
punish.', 1
Satan, 1
bowed, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
groaned., 1
'You, 1
mistake,', 1
he, 1
said,, 1
'providence, 1
does, 1
exist,, 1
only, 1
you, 1
have, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
him,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
child, 1
of, 1
God, 1
is, 1
as, 1
invisible, 1
as, 1
the, 1
parent., 1
You, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
nothing, 1
that, 1
resembles, 1
him,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
works, 1
by, 1
secret, 1
springs,, 1
and, 1
moves, 1
by, 1
hidden, 1
ways., 1
All, 1
I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
for, 1
you, 1
is, 1
to, 1
make, 1
you, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agents, 1
of, 1
that, 1
providence.', 1
The, 1
bargain, 1
was, 1
concluded., 1
I, 1
may, 1
sacrifice, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
but, 1
what, 1
matters, 1
it?", 1
added, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"If, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
were, 1
to, 1
do, 1
again,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
again, 1
do, 1
it.", 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
extreme, 1
amazement., 1
"Count,", 1
he, 1
inquired,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
relations?", 1
"No,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
worse.", 1
"Why?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Because, 1
then, 1
you, 1
might, 1
witness, 1
a, 1
spectacle, 1
calculated, 1
to, 1
break, 1
down, 1
your, 1
pride., 1
You, 1
say, 1
you, 1
fear, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
death?", 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
feared, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
only, 1
said, 1
that, 1
death, 1
alone, 1
could, 1
check, 1
the, 1
execution, 1
of, 1
my, 1
plans.", 1
"And, 1
old, 1
age?", 1
"My, 1
end, 1
will, 1
be, 1
achieved, 1
before, 1
I, 1
grow, 1
old.", 1
"And, 1
madness?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
nearly, 1
mad;, 1
and, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
axiom,--non, 1
bis, 1
in, 1
idem., 1
It, 1
is, 1
an, 1
axiom, 1
of, 1
criminal, 1
law,, 1
and,, 1
consequently,, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
its, 1
full, 1
application.", 1
"Sir,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
something, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
besides, 1
death,, 1
old, 1
age,, 1
and, 1
madness., 1
For, 1
instance,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
apoplexy--that, 1
lightning-stroke, 1
which, 1
strikes, 1
but, 1
does, 1
not, 1
destroy, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
which, 1
brings, 1
everything, 1
to, 1
an, 1
end., 1
You, 1
are, 1
still, 1
yourself, 1
as, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
are, 1
yourself, 1
no, 1
longer;, 1
you, 1
who,, 1
like, 1
Ariel,, 1
verge, 1
on, 1
the, 1
angelic,, 1
are, 1
but, 1
an, 1
inert, 1
mass,, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
Caliban,, 1
verges, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brutal;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
called, 1
in, 1
human, 1
tongues,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
neither, 1
more, 1
nor, 1
less, 1
than, 1
apoplexy., 1
Come,, 1
if, 1
so, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
continue, 1
this, 1
conversation, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house,, 1

day, 1

may, 1
be, 1
willing, 1
to, 1

an, 1
adversary, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
understanding, 1
and, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
refute, 1
you,, 1

will, 1
show, 1

of, 1

fiery, 1
Jacobins, 1

the, 1
most, 1
remarkable, 1
audacity,, 1
seconded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
most, 1
powerful, 1
organization--a, 1

has, 1
not,, 1
perhaps,, 1
like, 1
yourself, 1
seen, 1
all, 1
the, 1
kingdoms, 1
of, 1
the, 1

has, 1
helped, 1
to, 1
overturn, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest;, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1

you, 1

made, 1
an, 1
eternal, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
seeing, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cabinet,, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
being, 1
escorted, 1
to, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
by, 1
two, 1
footmen,, 1
who,, 1
on, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
from, 1
their, 1
master,, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
every, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
attention., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
breathed, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
sigh,, 1
and, 1
said,--"Enough, 1
of, 1
this, 1
poison,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
now, 1
seek, 1
the, 1
antidote.", 1
Then, 1
sounding, 1
his, 1
bell,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
entered,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
madam's, 1
chamber--have, 1

Haidee., 1
It, 1
will, 1
be, 1
recollected, 1
that, 1
the, 1
new,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
old,, 1
acquaintances, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1

in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay,, 1
were, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
Maximilian,, 1
Julie,, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel., 1
The, 1
very, 1
anticipations, 1
of, 1
delight, 1
to, 1
be, 1
enjoyed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
forthcoming, 1
visits--the, 1
bright,, 1
pure, 1
gleam, 1
of, 1
heavenly, 1
happiness, 1
it, 1
diffused, 1
over, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
deadly, 1
warfare, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
voluntarily, 1
engaged,, 1
illumined, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
countenance, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
ineffable, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
calmness,, 1
as,, 1
immediately, 1
after, 1
Villefort's, 1
departure,, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
flew, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cheering, 1
prospect, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
of, 1
tasting,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
a, 1
brief, 1
respite, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fierce, 1
and, 1
stormy, 1
passions, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
Even, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
obey, 1
the, 1
Count's, 1
summons,, 1
went, 1
forth, 1
from, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
presence, 1
in, 1
charmed, 1
amazement, 1
at, 1
the, 1
unusual, 1
animation, 1
and, 1
pleasure, 1
depicted, 1
on, 1
features, 1
ordinarily, 1
so, 1
stern, 1
and, 1
cold;, 1
while,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
dreading, 1
to, 1
put, 1
to, 1
flight, 1
the, 1
agreeable, 1
ideas, 1
hovering, 1
over, 1
his, 1
patron's, 1
meditations,, 1
whatever, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
the, 1
faithful, 1
Nubian, 1
walked, 1
on, 1
tiptoe, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
holding, 1
his, 1
breath,, 1
lest, 1
its, 1
faintest, 1
sound, 1
should, 1
dissipate, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
happy, 1
reverie., 1
It, 1
was, 1
noon,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
set, 1
apart, 1
one, 1
hour, 1
to, 1
be, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
of, 1
Haidee,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
his, 1
oppressed, 1
spirit, 1
could, 1
not, 1
all, 1
at, 1
once, 1
admit, 1
the, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
pure, 1
and, 1
unmixed, 1
joy,, 1
but, 1
required, 1
a, 1
gradual, 1
succession, 1
of, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
gentle, 1
emotions, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
full, 1
and, 1
perfect, 1
happiness,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
manner, 1
as, 1
ordinary, 1
natures, 1
demand, 1
to, 1
be, 1
inured, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reception, 1
of, 1
strong, 1
or, 1
violent, 1
sensations., 1
The, 1
young, 1
Greek,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
already, 1
said,, 1
occupied, 1
apartments, 1
wholly, 1
unconnected, 1
with, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
The, 1
rooms, 1
had, 1
been, 1
fitted, 1
up, 1
in, 1
strict, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
Oriental, 1
ideas;, 1
the, 1
floors, 1
were, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
richest, 1
carpets, 1
Turkey, 1
could, 1
produce;, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
brocaded, 1
silk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
magnificent, 1
designs, 1
and, 1
texture;, 1
while, 1
around, 1
each, 1
chamber, 1
luxurious, 1
divans, 1
were, 1
placed,, 1
with, 1
piles, 1
of, 1
soft, 1
and, 1
yielding, 1
cushions,, 1
that, 1
needed, 1
only, 1
to, 1
be, 1
arranged, 1
at, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
or, 1
convenience, 1
of, 1
such, 1
as, 1
sought, 1
repose., 1
Haidee, 1
had, 1
three, 1
French, 1
maids,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
who, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Greek., 1
The, 1
first, 1
three, 1
remained, 1
constantly, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
waiting-room,, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
obey, 1
the, 1
summons, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
golden, 1
bell,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
the, 1
orders, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Romaic, 1
slave,, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
just, 1
enough, 1
French, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
transmit, 1
her, 1
mistress's, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
three, 1
other, 1
waiting-women;, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
had, 1
received, 1
most, 1
peremptory, 1
instructions, 1
from, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
treat, 1
Haidee, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
deference, 1
they, 1
would, 1
observe, 1
to, 1
a, 1
queen., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
herself, 1
generally, 1
passed, 1
her, 1
time, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
at, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
end, 1
of, 1
her, 1
apartments., 1
This, 1
was, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
boudoir,, 1
circular,, 1
and, 1
lighted, 1
only, 1
from, 1
the, 1
roof,, 1
which, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
rose-colored, 1
glass., 1
Haidee, 1
was, 1
reclining, 1
upon, 1
soft, 1
downy, 1
cushions,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
blue, 1
satin, 1
spotted, 1
with, 1
silver;, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
her, 1
exquisitely, 1
moulded, 1
arms,, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
the, 1
divan, 1
immediately, 1
behind, 1
her,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
other, 1
was, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
adjusting, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
the, 1
coral, 1
tube, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
narghile,, 1
through, 1
whose, 1
flexible, 1
pipe, 1
she, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
smoke, 1
fragrant, 1
by, 1
its, 1
passage, 1
through, 1
perfumed, 1
water., 1
Her, 1
attitude,, 1
though, 1
perfectly, 1
natural, 1
for, 1
an, 1
Eastern, 1
woman, 1
would,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
European,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deemed, 1
too, 1
full, 1
of, 1
coquettish, 1
straining, 1
after, 1
effect., 1
Her, 1
dress,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
Epirus,, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
white, 1
satin, 1
trousers,, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
pink, 1
roses,, 1
displaying, 1
feet, 1
so, 1
exquisitely, 1
formed, 1
and, 1
so, 1
delicately, 1
fair,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
well, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
Parian, 1
marble,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
been, 1
undeceived, 1
by, 1
their, 1
movements, 1
as, 1
they, 1
constantly, 1
shifted, 1
in, 1
and, 1
out, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
little, 1
slippers, 1
with, 1
upturned, 1
toes,, 1
beautifully, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
pearls., 1
She, 1
wore, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
and, 1
white-striped, 1
vest,, 1
with, 1
long, 1
open, 1
sleeves,, 1
trimmed, 1
with, 1
silver, 1
loops, 1
and, 1
buttons, 1
of, 1
pearls,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
bodice,, 1
which,, 1
closing, 1
only, 1
from, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
to, 1
the, 1
waist,, 1
exhibited, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ivory, 1
throat, 1
and, 1
upper, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bosom;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fastened, 1
with, 1
three, 1
magnificent, 1
diamond, 1
clasps., 1
The, 1
junction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bodice, 1
and, 1
drawers, 1
was, 1
entirely, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
many-colored, 1
scarfs,, 1
whose, 1
brilliant, 1
hues, 1
and, 1
rich, 1
silken, 1
fringe, 1
have, 1
rendered, 1
them, 1
so, 1
precious, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
belles., 1
Tilted, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side, 1
of, 1
her, 1
head, 1
she, 1
had, 1
a, 1
small, 1
cap, 1
of, 1
gold-colored, 1
silk,, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
pearls;, 1
while, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
a, 1
purple, 1
rose, 1
mingled, 1
its, 1
glowing, 1
colors, 1
with, 1
the, 1
luxuriant, 1
masses, 1
of, 1
her, 1
hair,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
blackness, 1
was, 1
so, 1
intense, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
tinged, 1
with, 1
blue., 1
The, 1
extreme, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countenance,, 1
that, 1
shone, 1
forth, 1
in, 1
loveliness, 1
that, 1
mocked, 1
the, 1
vain, 1
attempts, 1
of, 1
dress, 1
to, 1
augment, 1
it,, 1
was, 1
peculiarly, 1
and, 1
purely, 1
Grecian;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
the, 1
large,, 1
dark,, 1
melting, 1
eyes,, 1
the, 1
finely, 1
formed, 1
nose,, 1
the, 1
coral, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
pearly, 1
teeth,, 1
that, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
her, 1
race, 1
and, 1
country., 1
And,, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
the, 1
whole,, 1
Haidee, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
very, 1
springtide, 1
and, 1
fulness, 1
of, 1
youthful, 1
charms--she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
numbered, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twenty, 1
summers., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
summoned, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
attendant,, 1
and, 1
bade, 1
her, 1
inquire, 1
whether, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
her, 1
mistress, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
his, 1
visit., 1
Haidee's, 1
only, 1
reply, 1
was, 1
to, 1
direct, 1
her, 1
servant, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
withdraw, 1
the, 1
tapestried, 1
curtain, 1
that, 1
hung, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
her, 1
boudoir,, 1
the, 1
framework, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
thus, 1
made, 1
serving, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
border, 1
to, 1
the, 1
graceful, 1
tableau, 1
presented, 1
by, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
picturesque, 1
attitude, 1
and, 1
appearance., 1
As, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
approached,, 1
she, 1
leaned, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
elbow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
that, 1
held, 1
the, 1
narghile,, 1
and, 1
extending, 1
to, 1
him, 1
her, 1
other, 1
hand,, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
captivating, 1
sweetness,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sonorous, 1
language, 1
spoken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
women, 1
of, 1
Athens, 1
and, 1
Sparta,, 1
"Why, 1
demand, 1
permission, 1
ere, 1
you, 1
enter?, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
my, 1
master,, 1
or, 1
have, 1
I, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
be, 1
your, 1
slave?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
returned, 1
her, 1
smile., 1
"Haidee,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"you, 1
well, 1
know.", 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
address, 1
me, 1
so, 1
coldly--so, 1
distantly?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
Greek., 1
"Have, 1
I, 1
by, 1
any, 1
means, 1
displeased, 1
you?, 1
Oh,, 1
if, 1
so,, 1
punish, 1
me, 1
as, 1
you, 1
will;, 1
but, 1
do, 1
not--do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
in, 1
tones, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
so, 1
formal, 1
and, 1
constrained.", 1
"Haidee,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
now, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
are, 1
free.", 1
"Free, 1
to, 1
do, 1
what?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
"Free, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
me.", 1
"Leave, 1
you?, 1
Why, 1
should, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
you?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
not, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
we, 1
are, 1
now, 1
about, 1
to, 1
mix, 1
in, 1
society--to, 1
visit, 1
and, 1
be, 1
visited.", 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
anybody, 1
but, 1
you.", 1
"And, 1
should, 1
you, 1
see, 1
one, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
could, 1
prefer,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
unjust"--, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
any, 1
one, 1
I, 1
preferred, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

I, 1
have, 1
never, 1

you, 1
and, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
"My, 1
poor, 1
child,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
because, 1
your, 1
father, 1
and, 1
myself, 1
are, 1
the, 1
only, 1
men, 1
who, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
talked, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
want, 1
anybody, 1
else, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
to, 1
me., 1
My, 1
father, 1
said, 1
I, 1
was, 1
his, 1
'joy'--you, 1
style, 1
me, 1
your, 1
'love,'--and, 1
both, 1
of, 1
you, 1
have, 1
called, 1
me, 1
'my, 1
child.'", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
remember, 1
your, 1
father,, 1
Haidee?", 1
The, 1
young, 1
Greek, 1
smiled., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
touching, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
her, 1
heart., 1
"And, 1
where, 1
am, 1
I?", 1
inquired, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
laughingly., 1
"You?", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
with, 1
tones, 1
of, 1
thrilling, 1
tenderness,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
everywhere!", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
the, 1
delicate, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
in, 1
his,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
child, 1
of, 1
nature, 1
hastily, 1
withdrew, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
her, 1
cheek., 1

approached,, 1

in, 1

striving, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
a, 1
quid, 1
of, 1
tobacco, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
thrust, 1
into, 1
his, 1
cheek., 1
A, 1
few, 1
locks, 1
of, 1
gray, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
still, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
matted,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
bronzed, 1
features, 1
and, 1
determined, 1
glance, 1
well, 1
suited, 1
an, 1
old, 1
sailor, 1
who, 1
had, 1
braved, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
equator, 1
and, 1
the, 1
storms, 1
of, 1
the, 1

"I, 1

you, 1
hailed, 1
me,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Julie?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
Penelon, 1
had, 1
still, 1
preserved, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
calling, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
daughter, 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Julie,", 1

had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
change, 1
the, 1

to, 1
Madame, 1
Herbault., 1
"Penelon,", 1
replied, 1
Julie,, 1
"go, 1

him, 1

Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,--"I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes,", 1
continued, 1
she;, 1
and, 1
without, 1
awaiting, 1
any, 1
reply,, 1
disappeared, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees,, 1

escaped, 1
to, 1

house, 1
by, 1
a, 1
lateral, 1
alley., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sorry, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1

no, 1
small, 1
disturbance, 1
in, 1
your, 1

"Look, 1
there,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
laughing;, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
her, 1

and, 1
twenty, 1
thousand, 1

not, 1
a, 1
large, 1
sum,, 1

replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
so, 1
sweet, 1
and, 1
gentle,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Maximilian's, 1
heart, 1
like, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father;, 1
"but, 1

labored, 1

toiled, 1
until, 1
he, 1
had, 1
amassed, 1
250,000, 1
francs;, 1
six, 1
years, 1

to, 1
achieve, 1
this, 1
object., 1
Oh,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1

it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
touching, 1

Maximilian,, 1

Maximilian, 1

when, 1
Emmanuel, 1
entered, 1

a, 1
hat, 1
and, 1
coat., 1
He, 1
saluted, 1
the, 1
count, 1

the, 1
air, 1
of, 1

man, 1

around, 1

to, 1

house., 1

large, 1
vase, 1
of, 1

filled, 1
with, 1
flowers, 1

air, 1
with, 1
their, 1
perfume,, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
Julie,, 1
suitably, 1
dressed,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
hair, 1
arranged, 1
(she, 1
had, 1
accomplished, 1
this, 1
feat, 1
in, 1
less, 1
than, 1
ten, 1
minutes),, 1
received, 1
the, 1
count, 1
on, 1
his, 1
entrance., 1
The, 1
songs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
birds, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
an, 1
aviary, 1
hard, 1
by,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
laburnums, 1
and, 1
rose, 1
acacias, 1
formed, 1
an, 1
exquisite, 1
framework, 1
to, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
velvet, 1
curtains., 1
Everything, 1
in, 1
this, 1
charming, 1
retreat,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
warble, 1
of, 1
the, 1
birds, 1
to, 1
the, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mistress,, 1
breathed, 1
tranquillity, 1
and, 1
repose., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
this, 1
happiness, 1
from, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
pensive,, 1
forgetting, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
ceased, 1
after, 1
the, 1
first, 1
salutations, 1
had, 1
been, 1
exchanged., 1
The, 1
silence, 1
became, 1
almost, 1
painful, 1
when,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort,, 1
tearing, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pleasing, 1
reverie--"Madame,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
"I, 1
pray, 1
you, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1
my, 1
emotion,, 1

could, 1
never, 1

looking, 1
at, 1
yourself, 1
and, 1
your, 1

"We, 1
are, 1
very, 1
happy,, 1

replied, 1
Julie;, 1
"but, 1
we, 1
have, 1
also, 1
known, 1
unhappiness,, 1

have, 1
ever, 1
undergone, 1
more, 1

The, 1
Count's, 1
features, 1
displayed, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
intense, 1
curiosity., 1
"Oh,, 1
all, 1

a, 1

told, 1

the, 1
other, 1
day,", 1
observed, 1
Maximilian., 1
"This, 1
humble, 1
picture, 1
would, 1
have, 1

little, 1
interest, 1

behold, 1
the, 1
pleasures, 1
and, 1
the, 1
misfortunes, 1
of, 1

industrious;, 1

such, 1
as, 1

have, 1
experienced, 1
bitter, 1
sorrows.", 1
"And, 1
God, 1
has, 1
poured, 1
balm, 1
into, 1
your, 1

he, 1
does, 1
into, 1
those, 1
of, 1
all, 1

in, 1
affliction?", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
inquiringly., 1
"Yes,, 1
count,", 1
returned, 1
Julie,, 1
"we, 1
may, 1
indeed, 1
say, 1
he, 1
has,, 1
for, 1

has, 1
done, 1

us, 1
what, 1

his, 1
angels.", 1
The, 1
count's, 1
cheeks, 1
became, 1
scarlet,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
coughed,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
have, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
for, 1
putting, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mouth., 1
"Those, 1

to, 1
wealth,, 1

who, 1
have, 1

means, 1
of, 1
gratifying, 1

any, 1

the, 1
tremulousness, 1
of, 1

followed, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1

pale, 1
as, 1

it, 1

was, 1
on, 1

on, 1

him, 1

who, 1
wrote, 1
me, 1

fifth, 1
of, 1

felt, 1
convinced, 1
of, 1

identity,, 1

he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
address, 1
him.", 1
"An, 1
Englishman,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
who, 1
grew, 1
uneasy, 1
at, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Julie, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him., 1
"An, 1
Englishman, 1
you, 1
say?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"an, 1
Englishman,, 1
who, 1
represented, 1
himself, 1
as, 1
the, 1
confidential, 1
clerk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
at, 1
Rome., 1
It, 1
was, 1
this, 1
that, 1
made, 1
me, 1
start, 1
when, 1

de, 1

Thomson, 1

told, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
1829., 1

God's, 1

me,, 1

you, 1

also,, 1

you, 1

"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
probable, 1
that, 1
this, 1

may, 1
be, 1
some, 1
one, 1
who,, 1
grateful, 1
for, 1
a, 1
kindness, 1

had, 1
shown, 1
him,, 1

even, 1
a, 1
miracle.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"He, 1
gave, 1
no, 1
other, 1
name,", 1
answered, 1
Julie,, 1
looking, 1
earnestly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"than, 1
that, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
his, 1
letter--'Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor.'", 1
"Which, 1
is, 1
evidently, 1
not, 1
his, 1
real, 1
name,, 1

a, 1
fictitious, 1
one.", 1
Then,, 1
noticing, 1
that, 1
Julie, 1
was, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
his, 1
voice,--, 1
"Tell, 1
me,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
"was, 1
he, 1
not, 1
about, 1
my, 1
height,, 1
perhaps, 1
a, 1
little, 1
taller,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
chin, 1

high, 1
cravat;, 1
his, 1
coat, 1
closely, 1

up,, 1

constantly, 1
taking, 1
out, 1
his, 1
pencil?", 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
then, 1
know, 1
him?", 1
cried, 1
Julie,, 1
whose, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
"No,", 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"I, 1
only, 1
guessed., 1
I, 1
knew, 1
a, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1

was, 1
constantly, 1
doing, 1
actions, 1
of, 1
this, 1
kind.", 1
"Without, 1
revealing, 1
himself?", 1
"He, 1
was, 1
an, 1
eccentric, 1
being,, 1

did, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
existence, 1
of, 1
gratitude.", 1
"Oh,, 1
heaven,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Julie,, 1
clasping, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
"in, 1
what, 1
did, 1
he, 1
believe,, 1
then?", 1
"He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
credit, 1
it, 1
at, 1
the, 1
period, 1
which, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
him,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
touched, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
by, 1
the, 1
accents, 1
of, 1
Julie's, 1
voice;, 1
"but,, 1
perhaps,, 1
since, 1
then, 1
he, 1
has, 1
had, 1
proofs, 1
that, 1
gratitude, 1
does, 1
exist.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this, 1
gentleman,, 1
monsieur?", 1
inquired, 1
Emmanuel., 1
"Oh,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
do, 1
know, 1
him,", 1
cried, 1
Julie,, 1
"can, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is--where, 1
we, 1
can, 1
find, 1
him?, 1
Maximilian--Emmanuel--if, 1
we, 1
do, 1
but, 1
discover, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gratitude, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart!", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
felt, 1
tears, 1
start, 1
into, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
again, 1
walked, 1
hastily, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
heaven,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
know, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"Alas,", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
repress, 1
his, 1
emotion,, 1
"if, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
was, 1
your, 1
unknown, 1
benefactor,, 1
I, 1
fear, 1
you, 1
will, 1
never, 1
see, 1
him, 1
again., 1
I, 1
parted, 1
from, 1
him, 1
two, 1
years, 1
ago, 1
at, 1
Palermo,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
then, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
setting, 1
out, 1
for, 1
the, 1
most, 1
remote, 1
regions;, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
fear, 1
he, 1
will, 1
never, 1
return.", 1
"Oh,, 1
monsieur,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
cruel, 1
of, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Julie,, 1
much, 1
affected;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady's, 1
eyes, 1
swam, 1
with, 1
tears., 1
"Madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gravely,, 1
and, 1
gazing, 1
earnestly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
two, 1
liquid, 1
pearls, 1
that, 1
trickled, 1
down, 1
Julie's, 1
cheeks,, 1
"had, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
seen, 1
what, 1
I, 1
now, 1
see,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
become, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
life,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
you, 1
shed, 1
would, 1
reconcile, 1
him, 1
to, 1
mankind;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
held, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Julie,, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
hers,, 1
carried, 1
away, 1
by, 1
the, 1
look, 1
and, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"But,", 1
continued, 1
she,, 1
"Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
had, 1
a, 1
family, 1
or, 1
friends,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
known, 1
some, 1
one,, 1
can, 1
we, 1
not--", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
useless, 1
to, 1
inquire,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"perhaps,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
man, 1
you, 1
seek, 1
for., 1
He, 1
was, 1
my, 1
friend:, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
secrets, 1
from, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
this, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
confided, 1
in, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
he, 1
told, 1
you, 1
nothing?", 1
"Not, 1
a, 1
word.", 1
"Nothing, 1
that, 1
would, 1
lead, 1
you, 1
to, 1
suppose?", 1
"Nothing.", 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1
him, 1
at, 1
once.", 1
"Ah,, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
case, 1
one, 1
supposes"--, 1
"Sister,, 1
sister,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
aid,, 1
"monsieur, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
right., 1
Recollect, 1
what, 1
our, 1
excellent, 1
father, 1
so, 1
often, 1
told, 1
us,, 1
'It, 1
was, 1
no, 1
Englishman, 1
that, 1
thus, 1
saved, 1
us.'", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
started., 1
"What, 1
did, 1
your, 1
father, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
Morrel?", 1
said, 1
he, 1
eagerly., 1
"My, 1
father, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
this, 1
action, 1
had, 1
been, 1
miraculously, 1
performed--he, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
a, 1
benefactor, 1
had, 1
arisen, 1
from, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
to, 1
save, 1
us., 1
Oh,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
touching, 1
superstition,, 1
monsieur,, 1
and, 1
although, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
myself, 1
believe, 1
it,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
world, 1
have, 1
destroyed, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
faith., 1
How, 1
often, 1
did, 1
he, 1
muse, 1
over, 1
it, 1
and, 1
pronounce, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dear, 1
friend--a, 1
friend, 1
lost, 1
to, 1
him, 1
forever;, 1
and, 1
on, 1
his, 1
death-bed,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
near, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
eternity, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
illumined, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
with, 1
supernatural, 1
light,, 1
this, 1
thought,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
until, 1
then, 1
been, 1
but, 1
a, 1
doubt,, 1
became, 1
a, 1
conviction,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
last, 1
words, 1
were,, 1
'Maximilian,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes!'", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
paleness,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
been, 1
increasing,, 1
became, 1
alarming;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
speak;, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
watch, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
has, 1
forgotten, 1
the, 1
hour,, 1
said, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hurried, 1
words, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Herbault,, 1
and, 1
pressing, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Emmanuel, 1
and, 1
Maximilian,--"Madame,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
you, 1

allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1

Julie;, 1

The, 1
proprietors, 1
of, 1
the, 1

had, 1
many, 1
years, 1
before, 1
thought, 1
it, 1

to, 1
the, 1
possession, 1
of, 1

to, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
shut, 1
in, 1
by, 1
this, 1
gate,, 1
which, 1
formerly, 1
communicated, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
kitchen-garden, 1
of, 1
about, 1
an, 1
acre., 1
For, 1
the, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
speculation, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
line,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
other, 1
words, 1
projected, 1
a, 1
street,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
side, 1
of, 1

The, 1

name, 1
was, 1
chosen, 1

before, 1

was, 1
begun,, 1
it, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
the, 1
possessor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
property, 1
that, 1
a, 1
handsome, 1
sum, 1
might, 1
be, 1
obtained, 1
for, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
then, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
fruits, 1
and, 1
vegetables,, 1
by, 1
building, 1
along, 1
the, 1
line, 1
of, 1
the, 1
proposed, 1
street,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
making, 1
it, 1
a, 1
branch, 1
of, 1
communication, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore, 1
itself,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
important, 1
thoroughfares, 1

In, 1
matters, 1
of, 1
speculation,, 1

"money, 1
disposes.", 1
From, 1
some, 1
such, 1
difficulty, 1
the, 1
newly, 1
named, 1
street, 1
died, 1
almost, 1
in, 1
birth,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
purchaser, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kitchen-garden,, 1
having, 1
paid, 1
a, 1
high, 1
price, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
being, 1
quite, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
find, 1
any, 1
one, 1
willing, 1
to, 1
take, 1
his, 1
bargain, 1
off, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
without, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
loss,, 1
yet, 1
still, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
belief, 1
that, 1
at, 1
some, 1
future, 1
day, 1
he, 1
should, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
sum, 1
for, 1
it, 1
that, 1
would, 1
repay, 1
him,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
for, 1
his, 1
past, 1
outlay,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
locked, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
new, 1
acquisition,, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
letting, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
temporarily, 1
to, 1
some, 1
market-gardeners,, 1
at, 1
a, 1
yearly, 1
rental, 1
of, 1
500, 1
francs., 1
And, 1
so,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
gate, 1
leading, 1
into, 1
the, 1
kitchen-garden, 1
had, 1
been, 1
closed, 1
up, 1
and, 1
left, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rust,, 1
which, 1
bade, 1
fair, 1
before, 1
long, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
off, 1
its, 1
hinges,, 1
while, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
ignoble, 1
glances, 1
of, 1
the, 1
diggers, 1
and, 1
delvers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
from, 1
presuming, 1
to, 1
sully, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
enclosure, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mansion,, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
had, 1
been, 1
boarded, 1
up, 1
to, 1
a, 1
height, 1
of, 1
six, 1
feet., 1
True,, 1
the, 1
planks, 1
were, 1
not, 1
so, 1
closely, 1
adjusted, 1
but, 1
that, 1
a, 1
hasty, 1
peep, 1
might, 1
be, 1
obtained, 1
through, 1
their, 1
interstices;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
strict, 1
decorum, 1
and, 1
rigid, 1
propriety, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
left, 1
no, 1
grounds, 1
for, 1
apprehending, 1
that, 1
advantage, 1
would, 1
be, 1
taken, 1
of, 1
that, 1
circumstance., 1
Horticulture, 1
seemed,, 1
however,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
abandoned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deserted, 1
kitchen-garden;, 1
and, 1
where, 1
cabbages,, 1
carrots,, 1
radishes,, 1
pease,, 1
and, 1
melons, 1
had, 1
once, 1
flourished,, 1
a, 1
scanty, 1
crop, 1
of, 1
lucerne, 1
alone, 1
bore, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
its, 1
being, 1
deemed, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
cultivation., 1
A, 1
small,, 1
low, 1
door, 1
gave, 1
egress, 1
from, 1
the, 1
walled, 1
space, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
describing, 1
into, 1
the, 1
projected, 1
street,, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
having, 1
been, 1
abandoned, 1
as, 1
unproductive, 1
by, 1
its, 1
various, 1
renters,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
now, 1
fallen, 1
so, 1
completely, 1
in, 1
general, 1
estimation, 1
as, 1
to, 1
return, 1
not, 1
even, 1
the, 1
one-half, 1
per, 1
cent, 1
it, 1
had, 1
originally, 1
paid., 1
Towards, 1
the, 1
house, 1
the, 1
chestnut-trees, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
mentioned, 1
rose, 1
high, 1
above, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
without, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
affecting, 1
the, 1
growth, 1
of, 1
other, 1
luxuriant, 1
shrubs, 1
and, 1
flowers, 1
that, 1
eagerly, 1
dressed, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
fill, 1
up, 1
the, 1
vacant, 1
spaces,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
asserting, 1
their, 1
right, 1
to, 1
enjoy, 1
the, 1
boon, 1
of, 1
light, 1
and, 1
air., 1
At, 1
one, 1
corner,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
foliage, 1
became, 1
so, 1
thick, 1
as, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
shut, 1
out, 1
day,, 1
a, 1
large, 1
stone, 1
bench, 1
and, 1
sundry, 1
rustic, 1
seats, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
this, 1
sheltered, 1
spot, 1
was, 1
either, 1
in, 1
general, 1
favor, 1
or, 1
particular, 1
use, 1
by, 1
some, 1
inhabitant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
faintly, 1
discernible, 1
through, 1
the, 1
dense, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
verdure, 1
that, 1
partially, 1
concealed, 1
it,, 1
though, 1
situated, 1
but, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
paces, 1
off., 1
Whoever, 1
had, 1
selected, 1
this, 1
retired, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grounds, 1
as, 1
the, 1
boundary, 1
of, 1
a, 1
walk,, 1
or, 1
as, 1
a, 1
place, 1
for, 1
meditation,, 1
was, 1
abundantly, 1
justified, 1
in, 1
the, 1
choice, 1
by, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
all, 1
glare,, 1
the, 1
cool,, 1
refreshing, 1
shade,, 1
the, 1
screen, 1
it, 1
afforded, 1
from, 1
the, 1
scorching, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1
that, 1
found, 1
no, 1
entrance, 1
there, 1
even, 1
during, 1
the, 1
burning, 1
days, 1
of, 1
hottest, 1
summer,, 1
the, 1
incessant, 1
and, 1
melodious, 1
warbling, 1
of, 1
birds,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
removal, 1
from, 1
either, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street, 1
or, 1
the, 1
bustle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mansion., 1
On, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
warmest, 1
days, 1
spring, 1
had, 1
yet, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
Paris,, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
negligently, 1
thrown, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
bench,, 1
a, 1
book,, 1
a, 1
parasol,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
work-basket,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
hung, 1
a, 1
partly, 1
embroidered, 1
cambric, 1
handkerchief,, 1
while, 1
at, 1
a, 1
little, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
these, 1
articles, 1
was, 1
a, 1
young, 1
woman,, 1
standing, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
gate,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
discern, 1
something, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
the, 1
openings, 1
in, 1
the, 1
planks,--the, 1
earnestness, 1
of, 1
her, 1
attitude, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fixed, 1
gaze, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
her, 1
wishes,, 1
proving, 1
how, 1
much, 1
her, 1
feelings, 1
were, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
the, 1
matter., 1
At, 1
that, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
little, 1
side-gate, 1
leading, 1
from, 1
the, 1
waste, 1
ground, 1
to, 1
the, 1
street, 1
was, 1
noiselessly, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
tall,, 1
powerful, 1
young, 1
man, 1
appeared., 1
He, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
common, 1
gray, 1
blouse, 1
and, 1
velvet, 1
cap,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
carefully, 1
arranged, 1
hair,, 1
beard, 1
and, 1
mustache,, 1
all, 1
of, 1
the, 1
richest, 1
and, 1
glossiest, 1
black,, 1
ill, 1
accorded, 1
with, 1
his, 1
plebeian, 1
attire., 1
After, 1
casting, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unobserved,, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
small, 1
gate,, 1
and,, 1
carefully, 1
closing, 1
and, 1
securing, 1
it, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
proceeded, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hurried, 1
step, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
barrier., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him, 1
she, 1
expected,, 1
though, 1
probably, 1
not, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
costume,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
started, 1
in, 1
terror,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
hasty, 1
retreat., 1
But, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
love, 1
had, 1
already, 1
seen,, 1
even, 1
through, 1
the, 1
narrow, 1
chinks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wooden, 1
palisades,, 1
the, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
white, 1
robe,, 1
and, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
fluttering, 1
of, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
sash., 1
Pressing, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
planks,, 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"Don't, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
Valentine--it, 1
is, 1
I!", 1
Again, 1
the, 1
timid, 1
girl, 1
found, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
saying,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
"And, 1
why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
come, 1
so, 1
late, 1
to-day?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
dinner-time,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
to, 1
use, 1
no, 1
little, 1
diplomacy, 1
to, 1
get, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
my, 1
watchful, 1
mother-in-law,, 1
my, 1
too-devoted, 1
maid,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
troublesome, 1
brother,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
always, 1
teasing, 1
me, 1
about, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
work, 1
at, 1
my, 1
embroidery,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fair, 1
way, 1
never, 1
to, 1
get, 1
done., 1
So, 1
pray, 1
excuse, 1
yourself, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can, 1
for, 1
having, 1
made, 1
me, 1
wait,, 1
and,, 1
after, 1
that,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
why, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dress, 1
so, 1
singular, 1
that, 1
at, 1
first, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
you.", 1
"Dearest, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"the, 1
difference, 1
between, 1
our, 1
respective, 1
stations, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
fear, 1
to, 1
offend, 1
you, 1
by, 1
speaking, 1
of, 1
my, 1
love,, 1
but, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
find, 1
myself, 1
in, 1
your, 1
presence, 1
without, 1
longing, 1
to, 1
pour, 1
forth, 1
my, 1
soul,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
how, 1
fondly, 1
I, 1
adore, 1
you., 1
If, 1
it, 1
be, 1
but, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
away, 1
with, 1
me, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
such, 1
sweet, 1
moments,, 1
I, 1
could, 1
even, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
for, 1
chiding, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
leaves, 1
me, 1
a, 1
gleam, 1
of, 1
hope,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
you, 1

not, 1

me, 1

that, 1
indeed, 1
would, 1
be, 1
worse, 1
than, 1
vanity, 1
to, 1
suppose),, 1
at, 1
least, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
your, 1
thoughts., 1
You, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
being, 1
late,, 1
and, 1
why, 1
I, 1
come, 1
disguised., 1
I, 1
will, 1
candidly, 1
explain, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
both,, 1

I, 1
trust, 1
to, 1
your, 1
goodness, 1
to, 1
pardon, 1
me., 1

have, 1
chosen, 1
a, 1
trade.", 1
"A, 1
trade?, 1
Oh,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
how, 1
can, 1
you, 1
jest, 1
at, 1
a, 1
time, 1
when, 1
we, 1
have, 1
such, 1
deep, 1
cause, 1
for, 1
uneasiness?", 1

is, 1
far, 1
dearer, 1
to, 1
me, 1

life, 1
itself!, 1

listen, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
Valentine,, 1

I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
all, 1
about, 1
it., 1
I, 1
became, 1
weary, 1
of, 1
ranging, 1
fields, 1
and, 1
scaling, 1
walls,, 1
and, 1
seriously, 1
alarmed, 1
at, 1

you,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
caught, 1
hovering, 1
about, 1

would, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
have, 1
me, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
prison, 1
as, 1
a, 1
thief., 1
That, 1
would, 1
compromise, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1

French, 1
army,, 1

say, 1
nothing, 1

continual, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
a, 1

no, 1
warlike, 1
projects, 1
could, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
account, 1
for, 1
it, 1
might, 1
well, 1
create, 1
surprise;, 1
so, 1
I, 1
have, 1
become, 1
a, 1
gardener,, 1

adopted, 1

costume, 1
of, 1

nonsense, 1
you, 1
talk,, 1
Maximilian!", 1
"Nonsense?, 1

is, 1
nothing, 1

imagine, 1
what, 1
happiness, 1

would, 1
afford, 1
me., 1
I, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
contain, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bare, 1
idea., 1

felicity, 1
seems, 1
above, 1
all, 1
price--as, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
impossible, 1
and, 1
unattainable., 1

would, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
I, 1
purchase, 1
all, 1
this, 1
delight,, 1
joy,, 1

happiness,, 1
for, 1
which, 1

a, 1
vague, 1
and, 1
indefinite, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
coming, 1

through, 1

been, 1
to, 1
me--the, 1
beautiful, 1
but, 1
cold, 1
resemblance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
marble, 1
Venus., 1
What, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
future, 1
reward, 1
have, 1
you, 1
made, 1
me, 1
for, 1
all, 1
the, 1
submission, 1
and, 1
obedience, 1
I, 1
have, 1
evinced?--none, 1
whatever., 1
What, 1
granted, 1
me?--scarcely, 1
more., 1
You, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
your, 1
betrothed, 1
lover,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
shrink, 1
from, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
being, 1
his, 1
wife;, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
Valentine,, 1
is, 1
there, 1
no, 1
other, 1
sorrow, 1
in, 1
your, 1
heart?, 1
You, 1
see, 1
me, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
body, 1
and, 1
soul,, 1
my, 1
life, 1
and, 1
each, 1
warm, 1
drop, 1
that, 1
circles, 1
round, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
are, 1
consecrated, 1
to, 1
your, 1
service;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
full, 1
well, 1
that, 1
my, 1
existence, 1
is, 1
bound, 1
up, 1
in, 1
yours--that, 1
were, 1
I, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
you, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
outlive, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
such, 1
crushing, 1
misery;, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
calmness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prospect, 1
of, 1
your, 1
being, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
of, 1
another!, 1
Oh,, 1
Valentine,, 1
were, 1
I, 1
in, 1
your, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
conscious,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
of, 1
being, 1
worshipped,, 1
adored,, 1
with, 1
such, 1
a, 1
love, 1
as, 1
mine,, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times, 1
at, 1
least, 1
should, 1
I, 1
have, 1
passed, 1
my, 1
hand, 1
between, 1
these, 1
iron, 1
bars,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
'Take, 1
this, 1
hand,, 1
dearest, 1
Maximilian,, 1
and, 1
believe, 1
that,, 1
living, 1
or, 1
dead,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
yours--yours, 1
only,, 1
and, 1
forever!'", 1
The, 1
poor, 1
girl, 1
made, 1
no, 1
reply,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
could, 1
plainly, 1
hear, 1
her, 1
sobs, 1
and, 1
tears., 1
A, 1
rapid, 1
change, 1
took, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
feelings., 1
"Dearest,, 1
dearest, 1
Valentine,", 1
exclaimed, 1
he,, 1
"forgive, 1
me, 1
if, 1
I, 1
have, 1
offended, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
words, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1

unwittingly, 1
caused, 1
you, 1
pain.", 1
"No,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
offended,", 1
answered, 1
she,, 1
"but, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
what, 1
a, 1
poor,, 1
helpless, 1
being, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
and, 1
an, 1
outcast, 1
in, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
house,, 1
where, 1
even, 1
he, 1
is, 1
seldom, 1
seen;, 1
whose, 1
will, 1
has, 1
been, 1
thwarted,, 1
and, 1
spirits, 1
broken,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
age, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
years,, 1

the, 1
iron, 1
rod, 1

sternly, 1
held, 1
over, 1
me;, 1
oppressed,, 1
mortified,, 1
and, 1
persecuted,, 1

by, 1
day,, 1
hour, 1
by, 1
hour,, 1
minute, 1
by, 1
minute,, 1
no, 1
person, 1
has, 1
cared, 1
for,, 1
even, 1
observed, 1
my, 1
sufferings,, 1

have, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
breathed, 1
one, 1
word, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1

to, 1
yourself., 1
Outwardly, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
kindness, 1
and, 1
affection;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
reverse, 1
is, 1
the, 1
case., 1
The, 1
general, 1
remark, 1
is,, 1
'Oh,, 1
it, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
one, 1
of, 1
so, 1
stern, 1
a, 1
character, 1
as, 1
M., 1

could, 1
lavish, 1
the, 1
tenderness, 1
some, 1
fathers, 1
do, 1
on, 1
their, 1
daughters., 1

has, 1
lost, 1
her, 1

Madame, 1
de, 1

The, 1
world,, 1
however,, 1
is, 1
mistaken;, 1
my, 1
father, 1
abandons, 1
me, 1
from, 1
utter, 1
indifference,, 1
while, 1
my, 1
mother-in-law, 1
detests, 1
me, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hatred, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
more, 1
terrible, 1
because, 1
it, 1
is, 1
veiled, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
continual, 1
smile.", 1
"Hate, 1
you,, 1
sweet, 1
Valentine,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"how, 1
is, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
for, 1
any, 1
one, 1
to, 1
do, 1
that?", 1
"Alas,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
weeping, 1
girl,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
own, 1
that, 1
my, 1
mother-in-law's, 1
aversion, 1
to, 1

matters, 1
into, 1
our, 1
present, 1
conversation,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
just, 1

this, 1
much--that, 1
her, 1
extreme, 1
dislike, 1
to, 1
me, 1
has, 1
its, 1
origin, 1
there;, 1
and, 1

me, 1
the, 1
fortune, 1

richly, 1
endowed., 1

gladly, 1
would, 1

half, 1

wealth, 1

persist, 1
in, 1
anticipating, 1
the, 1
worst,--why, 1
picture, 1
so, 1
gloomy, 1
a, 1

you, 1

it?, 1

have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
mistake), 1

Morrel,', 1

then, 1
knitting, 1
his, 1
brows, 1
into, 1
a, 1
deep, 1

he, 1
added,, 1

Maximilian;, 1

Maximilian, 1
with, 1
a, 1

returned, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
negative., 1
'Perhaps, 1

at, 1

crop, 1
of, 1

to, 1

up, 1

most, 1
ruthless, 1
way,, 1

aloud., 1

the, 1
customary, 1
signal, 1

of, 1
for, 1
two, 1
whole, 1
days,, 1
made, 1
all, 1
possible, 1
haste, 1

not, 1
from, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1

out, 1
of, 1
any, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
gratitude, 1
to, 1

from, 1
sheer, 1
curiosity,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
some, 1
chance, 1
remark, 1
might, 1
give, 1
him, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
for, 1
making, 1
one, 1
of, 1

there?", 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
no,, 1
no,, 1
no,, 1
she, 1

words., 1

she,, 1
then?, 1

you, 1
tell?", 1

chestnut-tree,", 1

the, 1
spoiled, 1
brat,, 1

of, 1

flies, 1
to, 1
the, 1
parrot,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
keenly, 1
to, 1
relish, 1
such, 1
fare., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
ring,, 1
intending, 1
to, 1
direct, 1
her, 1
waiting-maid, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
she, 1
would, 1
find, 1
Valentine,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
herself, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
She, 1
appeared, 1
much, 1
dejected;, 1
and, 1
any, 1
person, 1
who, 1
considered, 1
her, 1
attentively, 1
might, 1
have, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
recent, 1
tears, 1
in, 1
her, 1
eyes., 1
Valentine,, 1

we, 1
have, 1
in, 1
the, 1
rapid, 1
march, 1
of, 1
our, 1
narrative, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
without, 1
formally, 1
introducing, 1
her,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tall, 1
and, 1
graceful, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
nineteen,, 1
with, 1
bright, 1
chestnut, 1
hair,, 1
deep, 1
blue, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
reposeful, 1
air, 1
of, 1
quiet, 1
distinction, 1
which, 1
characterized, 1
her, 1
mother., 1
Her, 1
white, 1
and, 1
slender, 1
fingers,, 1
her, 1
pearly, 1
neck,, 1
her, 1
cheeks, 1
tinted, 1
with, 1
varying, 1
hues, 1
reminded, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lovely, 1
Englishwomen, 1
who, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
poetically, 1
compared, 1
in, 1
their, 1
manner, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gracefulness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
swan., 1
She, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
near, 1
her, 1
stepmother, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
had, 1
already, 1
heard, 1
so, 1
much,, 1
saluted, 1
him, 1
without, 1
any, 1
girlish, 1
awkwardness,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
lowering, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
elegance, 1
that, 1
redoubled, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
attention., 1
He, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
return, 1
the, 1
salutation., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
my, 1
daughter-in-law,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
leaning, 1
back, 1
on, 1
her, 1
sofa, 1

towards, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
"And, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
King, 1
of, 1
China,, 1
Emperor, 1
of, 1
Cochin-China,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
imp,, 1
looking, 1
slyly, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
sister., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
at, 1
this, 1
really, 1
did, 1
turn, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
very, 1
nearly, 1
angry, 1
with, 1
this, 1
household, 1
plague,, 1
who, 1
answered, 1
to, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Edward;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
complacently,, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
maternal, 1
heart, 1
to, 1
bound, 1
again, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
enthusiasm., 1
"But,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
continuing, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
by, 1
turns, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Valentine,, 1
"have, 1
I, 1

idea, 1
came, 1
over, 1
my, 1
mind,, 1

as, 1
mademoiselle, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
her, 1
was, 1
an, 1
additional, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
thrown, 1
on, 1

confused, 1
remembrance;, 1

de, 1
Villefort, 1

not, 1
very, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
society,, 1

we, 1
very, 1
seldom, 1
go, 1
out,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady., 1
"Then, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
society, 1
that, 1
I, 1
met, 1
with, 1
mademoiselle, 1

yourself,, 1

this, 1
charming, 1
little, 1

you, 1
will, 1
permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1

The, 1
Count, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1

his, 1

"No--it, 1
was, 1
somewhere--away, 1
from, 1
here--it, 1
was--I, 1

not, 1
know--but, 1
it, 1

that, 1
this, 1
recollection, 1
is, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
sky, 1
and, 1
some, 1
religious, 1

mademoiselle, 1
was, 1
holding, 1
flowers, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1

to, 1
my, 1
aid,, 1

"No,, 1
indeed,", 1

Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1

"Ah,, 1
yes--true,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
as, 1
if, 1
this, 1
simple, 1
explanation, 1
was, 1
sufficient, 1
to, 1
revive, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
he, 1
sought., 1
"It, 1
was, 1

my, 1

beautiful, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count., 1

the, 1
darling, 1
Edward., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
assist, 1
your, 1
memory,, 1

continued, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"the, 1
day, 1
had, 1

I, 1
caught, 1
it,, 1
mamma,, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
remember?", 1

Edward,, 1

I, 1

feathers, 1
out, 1
of, 1

tail.", 1
"You,, 1
madame,, 1
remained, 1
under, 1

a, 1
considerable, 1
time, 1
with, 1
somebody?", 1

in, 1

yes,", 1

the, 1
young, 1
lady,, 1
turning, 1
very, 1
red,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
remember, 1
conversing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
person, 1
wrapped, 1
in, 1
a, 1
long, 1
woollen, 1
mantle;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
medical, 1
man,, 1

think.", 1
"Precisely, 1
so,, 1
madame;, 1
this, 1
man, 1
was, 1
myself;, 1
for, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1

had, 1
been, 1
at, 1
that, 1
hotel,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
period, 1
I, 1
had, 1
cured, 1
my, 1
valet, 1
de, 1

of, 1
a, 1
fever,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
landlord, 1
of, 1

that, 1
I, 1
really, 1
acquired, 1
a, 1
reputation, 1

a, 1
skilful, 1
physician., 1

subjects;, 1
of, 1
Perugino,, 1
of, 1

famous, 1
aquatofana,, 1

they, 1
had, 1
told, 1

think, 1

that, 1
certain, 1
individuals, 1
in, 1
Perugia, 1
had, 1
preserved, 1
the, 1
secret.", 1
"Yes,, 1
true,", 1

Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
somewhat, 1
uneasily,, 1
"I, 1
remember, 1
now.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
recollect, 1
now, 1
all, 1
the, 1
various, 1
subjects, 1
of, 1

we, 1
discoursed,, 1

continued, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
calmness;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
perfectly, 1
remember, 1
that,, 1

into, 1
the, 1
error, 1

the, 1
health, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"Yes,, 1
really,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
in, 1
fact, 1
a, 1
medical, 1
man,", 1

Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"since, 1
you, 1
had, 1
cured, 1
the, 1
sick.", 1
"Moliere, 1

Beaumarchais, 1
would, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
madame,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1

my, 1
patients;, 1

natural, 1
sciences, 1
somewhat, 1
deeply,, 1

still, 1
only, 1

an, 1
amateur,, 1

this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
six., 1

is, 1
six, 1
o'clock,", 1

Valentine, 1
rose,, 1

saluting, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
left, 1

the, 1
count,, 1

Villefort, 1
away?", 1
"By, 1
no, 1

the, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
quickly;, 1
"but, 1

Then, 1

lady,, 1
laughing;, 1

instantly., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
falls,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
depart., 1
They, 1
are, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
consequences, 1
of, 1
the, 1

of, 1
office,, 1

the, 1
corporal, 1
with, 1
his, 1
four, 1
men;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
fools, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
as, 1
easy, 1
as, 1
lying., 1
But, 1
go, 1
a, 1
little, 1
way, 1
from, 1
France--go, 1
either, 1
to, 1
Aleppo, 1
or, 1
Cairo,, 1
or, 1
only, 1
to, 1
Naples, 1
or, 1
Rome,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
people, 1
passing, 1
by, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets--people, 1
erect,, 1
smiling,, 1
and, 1
fresh-colored,, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
Asmodeus,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
holding, 1
on, 1
by, 1
the, 1
skirt, 1
of, 1
his, 1

"Then,", 1
remarked, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"they, 1
have, 1
again, 1

said, 1
was, 1

at, 1
Perugia.", 1
"Ah,, 1
but, 1
madame,, 1
does, 1
mankind, 1
ever, 1
lose, 1
anything?, 1
The, 1
arts, 1
change, 1
about, 1
and, 1
make, 1
a, 1
tour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world;, 1
things, 1
take, 1
a, 1
different, 1
name,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
vulgar, 1
do, 1
not, 1
follow, 1
them--that, 1
is, 1
all;, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
always, 1
the, 1
same, 1
result., 1
Poisons, 1
act, 1
particularly, 1
on, 1
some, 1
organ, 1

another--one, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stomach,, 1
another, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brain,, 1
another, 1
on, 1
the, 1

Well,, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
brings, 1
on, 1
a, 1
cough,, 1
the, 1
cough, 1
an, 1
inflammation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lungs,, 1
or, 1
some, 1
other, 1
complaint, 1
catalogued, 1
in, 1
the, 1
book, 1
of, 1
science,, 1
which,, 1
however,, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
precludes, 1
it, 1
from, 1
being, 1
decidedly, 1
mortal;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
not,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
become, 1
so,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
remedies, 1
applied, 1
by, 1
foolish, 1
doctors,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
generally, 1
bad, 1
chemists,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
will, 1
act, 1
in, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
or, 1
against, 1
the, 1
malady,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
human, 1

killed, 1

all, 1

and, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
justice, 1
learns, 1
nothing,, 1
as, 1
was, 1
said, 1
by, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
chemist, 1
of, 1
my, 1
acquaintance,, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte, 1
of, 1
Taormina,, 1
in, 1
Sicily,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
studied, 1
these, 1
national, 1
phenomena, 1
very, 1
profoundly.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
frightful,, 1
but, 1
deeply, 1
interesting,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady,, 1
motionless, 1
with, 1
attention., 1
"I, 1
thought,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
confess,, 1
that, 1
these, 1
tales,, 1
were, 1
inventions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Middle, 1
Ages.", 1
"Yes,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
but, 1
improved, 1
upon, 1
by, 1
ours., 1
What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
rewards, 1
of, 1
merit,, 1
medals,, 1
crosses,, 1
Monthyon, 1
prizes,, 1
if, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
lead, 1
society, 1
towards, 1
more, 1
complete, 1
perfection?, 1
Yet, 1
man, 1
will, 1
never, 1
be, 1
perfect, 1
until, 1
he, 1
learns, 1
to, 1
create, 1
and, 1
destroy;, 1
he, 1
does, 1
know, 1
how, 1
to, 1
destroy,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
half, 1
the, 1
battle.", 1
"So,", 1
added, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
constantly, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
her, 1
object,, 1
"the, 1
poisons, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Borgias,, 1
the, 1
Medicis,, 1
the, 1
Renes,, 1
the, 1
Ruggieris,, 1
and, 1
later,, 1
probably,, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Baron, 1
de, 1
Trenck,, 1
whose, 1
story, 1
has, 1
been, 1
so, 1
misused, 1
by, 1
modern, 1
drama, 1
and, 1
romance"--, 1
"Were, 1
objects, 1
of, 1
art,, 1
madame,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
more,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
the, 1
real, 1
savant, 1
addresses, 1
himself, 1
stupidly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mere, 1
individual?, 1
By, 1
no, 1
means., 1
Science, 1
loves, 1
eccentricities,, 1
leaps, 1
and, 1
bounds,, 1
trials, 1
of, 1
strength,, 1
fancies,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
may, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
so, 1
to, 1
term, 1
them., 1
Thus,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
the, 1
excellent, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte,, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
just, 1
now,, 1
made, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way, 1
some, 1
marvellous, 1
experiments.", 1
"Really?", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
mention, 1
one, 1
to, 1
you., 1
He, 1
had, 1
a, 1
remarkably, 1
fine, 1
garden,, 1
full, 1
of, 1
vegetables,, 1
flowers,, 1
and, 1
fruit., 1
From, 1
amongst, 1
these, 1
vegetables, 1
he, 1
selected, 1
the, 1
most, 1
simple--a, 1
cabbage,, 1
for, 1
instance., 1
For, 1
three, 1
days, 1
he, 1
watered, 1
this, 1
cabbage, 1
with, 1
a, 1
distillation, 1
of, 1
arsenic;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third,, 1
the, 1
cabbage, 1
began, 1
to, 1
droop, 1
and, 1
turn, 1
yellow., 1
At, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
cut, 1
it., 1
In, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
everybody, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
fit, 1
for, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
preserved, 1
its, 1
wholesome, 1
appearance., 1
It, 1
was, 1
only, 1
poisoned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte., 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
the, 1
cabbage, 1
to, 1
the, 1
room, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
rabbits--for, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte, 1
had, 1
a, 1
collection, 1
of, 1
rabbits,, 1
cats,, 1
and, 1
guinea-pigs,, 1
fully, 1
as, 1
fine, 1
as, 1
his, 1
collection, 1
of, 1
vegetables,, 1
flowers,, 1
and, 1
fruit., 1
Well,, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte, 1
took, 1
a, 1
rabbit,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
it, 1
eat, 1
a, 1
leaf, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cabbage., 1
The, 1
rabbit, 1
died., 1
What, 1
magistrate, 1
would, 1
find,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
insinuate,, 1
anything, 1
against, 1
this?, 1
What, 1
procureur, 1
has, 1
ever, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
up, 1
an, 1
accusation, 1
against, 1
M., 1
Magendie, 1
or, 1
M., 1
Flourens,, 1
in, 1
consequence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rabbits,, 1
cats,, 1
and, 1
guinea-pigs, 1
they, 1
have, 1
killed?--not, 1
one., 1
So,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
rabbit, 1
dies,, 1
and, 1
justice, 1
takes, 1
no, 1
notice., 1
This, 1
rabbit, 1
dead,, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte, 1
has, 1
its, 1
entrails, 1
taken, 1
out, 1
by, 1
his, 1
cook, 1
and, 1
thrown, 1
on, 1
the, 1
dunghill;, 1
on, 1
this, 1
dunghill, 1
is, 1
a, 1
hen,, 1
who,, 1
pecking, 1
these, 1
intestines,, 1
is, 1
in, 1
her, 1
turn, 1
taken, 1
ill,, 1
and, 1
dies, 1
next, 1
day., 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
she, 1
is, 1
struggling, 1
in, 1
the, 1
convulsions, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
a, 1
vulture, 1
is, 1
flying, 1
by, 1
(there, 1
are, 1
a, 1
good, 1
many, 1
vultures, 1
in, 1
Adelmonte's, 1
country);, 1
this, 1
bird, 1
darts, 1
on, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
fowl,, 1
and, 1
carries, 1
it, 1
away, 1
to, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
dines, 1
off, 1
its, 1
prey., 1
Three, 1
days, 1
afterwards,, 1
this, 1
poor, 1
vulture,, 1
which, 1
has, 1
been, 1
very, 1
much, 1
indisposed, 1
since, 1
that, 1
dinner,, 1
suddenly, 1
feels, 1
very, 1
giddy, 1
while, 1
flying, 1
aloft, 1
in, 1
the, 1
clouds,, 1
and, 1
falls, 1
heavily, 1
into, 1
a, 1
fish-pond., 1
The, 1
pike,, 1
eels,, 1
and, 1
carp, 1
eat, 1
greedily, 1
always,, 1
as, 1
everybody, 1
knows--well,, 1
they, 1
feast, 1
on, 1
the, 1
vulture., 1
Now, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
eels,, 1
or, 1
pike,, 1
or, 1
carp,, 1
poisoned, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
remove,, 1
is, 1
served, 1
up, 1
at, 1
your, 1
table., 1
Well,, 1
then,, 1
your, 1
guest, 1
will, 1
be, 1
poisoned, 1
at, 1

eight, 1

ten, 1
days,, 1
of, 1
pains, 1
in, 1
the, 1
intestines,, 1
sickness,, 1
or, 1
abscess, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pylorus., 1
The, 1
doctors, 1
open, 1
the, 1
body, 1
and, 1
say, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
profound, 1
learning,, 1
'The, 1
subject, 1

died, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tumor, 1
on, 1
the, 1
liver,, 1

of, 1
typhoid, 1
fever!'", 1
"But,", 1
remarked, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"all, 1
these, 1
circumstances, 1
which, 1
you, 1
link, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
one, 1
another, 1
may, 1
be, 1
broken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
least, 1
accident;, 1
the, 1
vulture, 1
may, 1
not, 1
see, 1
the, 1
fowl,, 1
or, 1
may, 1
fall, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
yards, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fish-pond.", 1
"Ah,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
where, 1
the, 1
art, 1
comes, 1
in., 1
To, 1
be, 1
a, 1
great, 1
chemist, 1
in, 1
the, 1
East,, 1
one, 1
must, 1
direct, 1
chance;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
achieved."--Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
thought,, 1
yet, 1
listened, 1
attentively., 1
"But,", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
suddenly,, 1
"arsenic, 1
is, 1
indelible,, 1
indestructible;, 1
in, 1
whatsoever, 1
way, 1
it, 1
is, 1
absorbed,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
found, 1
again, 1
in, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
from, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
it, 1
has, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
in, 1
sufficient, 1
quantity, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
death.", 1
"Precisely, 1
so,", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo--"precisely, 1
so;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
said, 1
to, 1
my, 1
worthy, 1
Adelmonte., 1
He, 1
reflected,, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
replied, 1
to, 1
me, 1
by, 1
a, 1
Sicilian, 1
proverb,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
is, 1
also, 1
a, 1
French, 1
proverb,, 1
'My, 1
son,, 1
the, 1
world, 1
was, 1
not, 1
made, 1
in, 1
a, 1
day--but, 1
in, 1
seven., 1
Return, 1
on, 1
Sunday.', 1
On, 1
the, 1
Sunday, 1
following, 1
I, 1
did, 1
return, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
having, 1
watered, 1
his, 1
cabbage, 1
with, 1
arsenic,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
watered, 1
it, 1
this, 1
time, 1
with, 1
a, 1
solution, 1
of, 1
salts,, 1
having, 1
their, 1
basis, 1
in, 1
strychnine,, 1
strychnos, 1
colubrina,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
learned, 1
term, 1
it., 1
Now,, 1
the, 1
cabbage, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
disease, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
rabbit, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
smallest, 1
distrust;, 1
yet,, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards,, 1
the, 1
rabbit, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
The, 1
fowl, 1
pecked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
rabbit,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day, 1
was, 1
a, 1
dead, 1
hen., 1
This, 1
time, 1
we, 1
were, 1
the, 1
vultures;, 1
so, 1
we, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
bird,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
time, 1
all, 1
special, 1
symptoms, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
there, 1
were, 1
only, 1
general, 1
symptoms., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
peculiar, 1
indication, 1
in, 1
any, 1
organ--an, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nervous, 1
system--that, 1
was, 1
it;, 1
a, 1
case, 1
of, 1
cerebral, 1
congestion--nothing, 1
more., 1
The, 1
fowl, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
poisoned--she, 1
had, 1
died, 1
of, 1
apoplexy., 1
Apoplexy, 1
is, 1
a, 1
rare, 1
disease, 1
among, 1
fowls,, 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
but, 1
very, 1
common, 1
among, 1
men.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
appeared, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
thoughtful., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
fortunate,", 1
she, 1
observed,, 1
"that, 1
such, 1
substances, 1
could, 1
only, 1
be, 1
prepared, 1
by, 1
chemists;, 1
otherwise,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
would, 1
be, 1
poisoning, 1
each, 1
other.", 1
"By, 1
chemists, 1
and, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
have, 1
a, 1
taste, 1
for, 1
chemistry,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
carelessly., 1
"And, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
endeavoring, 1
by, 1
a, 1
struggle,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
effort,, 1
to, 1
get, 1
away, 1
from, 1
her, 1
thoughts,, 1
"however, 1
skilfully, 1
it, 1
is, 1
prepared,, 1
crime, 1
is, 1
always, 1
crime,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
avoid, 1
human, 1
scrutiny,, 1
it, 1
does, 1
not, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
God., 1
The, 1
Orientals, 1
are, 1
stronger, 1
than, 1
we, 1
are, 1
in, 1
cases, 1
of, 1
conscience,, 1
and,, 1
very, 1
prudently,, 1
have, 1
no, 1
hell--that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
point.", 1
"Really,, 1
madame,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
scruple, 1
which, 1
naturally, 1
must, 1
occur, 1
to, 1
a, 1
pure, 1
mind, 1
like, 1
yours,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
would, 1
easily, 1
yield, 1
before, 1
sound, 1
reasoning., 1
The, 1
bad, 1
side, 1
of, 1
human, 1
thought, 1
will, 1
always, 1
be, 1
defined, 1
by, 1
the, 1
paradox, 1
of, 1
Jean, 1
Jacques, 1
Rousseau,--you, 1
remember,--the, 1
mandarin, 1
who, 1
is, 1
killed, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
leagues, 1
off, 1
by, 1
raising, 1
the, 1
tip, 1
of, 1
the, 1
finger., 1
Man's, 1
whole, 1
life, 1
passes, 1
in, 1
doing, 1
these, 1
things,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
intellect, 1
is, 1
exhausted, 1
by, 1
reflecting, 1
on, 1
them., 1
You, 1
will, 1
find, 1
very, 1
few, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
brutally, 1
thrust, 1
a, 1
knife, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fellow-creature,, 1
or, 1
will, 1
administer, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
him, 1
from, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
globe, 1
on, 1
which, 1
we, 1
move, 1
with, 1
life, 1
and, 1
animation,, 1
that, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
arsenic, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
just, 1
now, 1
talked., 1
Such, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
really, 1
out, 1
of, 1
rule--eccentric, 1
or, 1
stupid., 1
To, 1
attain, 1
such, 1
a, 1
point,, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
must, 1
be, 1
heated, 1
to, 1
thirty-six, 1
degrees,, 1
the, 1
pulse, 1
be,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
at, 1
ninety,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
excited, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
ordinary, 1
limit., 1
But, 1
suppose, 1
one, 1
pass,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
permissible, 1
in, 1
philology,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
word, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
its, 1
softened, 1
synonym,, 1
then,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
committing, 1
an, 1
ignoble, 1
assassination, 1
you, 1
make, 1
an, 1
'elimination;', 1
you, 1
merely, 1
and, 1
simply, 1
remove, 1
from, 1
your, 1
path, 1
the, 1
individual, 1
who, 1
is, 1
in, 1
your, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
without, 1
shock, 1
or, 1
violence,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
display, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sufferings, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
case, 1
of, 1
becoming, 1
a, 1
punishment,, 1
make, 1
a, 1
martyr, 1
of, 1
the, 1
victim,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
butcher,, 1
in, 1
every, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
the, 1
word,, 1
of, 1
him, 1
who, 1
inflicts, 1
them., 1
Then, 1
there, 1
will, 1
be, 1
no, 1
blood,, 1
no, 1
groans,, 1
no, 1
convulsions,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
no, 1
consciousness, 1
of, 1
that, 1
horrid, 1
and, 1
compromising, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
accomplishing, 1
the, 1
act,--then, 1
one, 1
escapes, 1
the, 1
clutch, 1
of, 1
the, 1
human, 1
law,, 1
which, 1
says,, 1
'Do, 1
not, 1
disturb, 1
society!', 1
This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
mode, 1
in, 1
which, 1
they, 1
manage, 1
these, 1
things,, 1
and, 1
succeed, 1
in, 1
Eastern, 1
climes,, 1
where, 1
there, 1
are, 1
grave, 1
and, 1
phlegmatic, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
care, 1
very, 1
little, 1
for, 1
the, 1
questions, 1
of, 1
time, 1
in, 1
conjunctures, 1
of, 1
importance.", 1
"Yet, 1
conscience, 1
remains,", 1
remarked, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
an, 1
agitated, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stifled, 1
sigh., 1
"Yes,", 1
answered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"happily,, 1
yes,, 1
conscience, 1
does, 1
remain;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
did, 1
not,, 1
how, 1
wretched, 1
we, 1
should, 1
be!, 1
After, 1
every, 1
action, 1
requiring, 1
exertion,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
conscience, 1
that, 1
saves, 1
us,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
supplies, 1
us, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
good, 1
excuses,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
alone, 1
are, 1
judges;, 1
and, 1
these, 1
reasons,, 1
howsoever, 1
excellent, 1
in, 1
producing, 1
sleep,, 1
would, 1
avail, 1
us, 1
but, 1
very, 1
little, 1
before, 1
a, 1
tribunal,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
were, 1
tried, 1
for, 1
our, 1
lives., 1
Thus, 1
Richard, 1
III.,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
was, 1
marvellously, 1
served, 1
by, 1
his, 1
conscience, 1
after, 1
the, 1
putting, 1
away, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
children, 1
of, 1
Edward, 1
IV.;, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
say,, 1
'These, 1
two, 1
children, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cruel, 1
and, 1
persecuting, 1
king,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
inherited, 1
the, 1
vices, 1
of, 1
their, 1
father,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
alone, 1
could, 1
perceive, 1
in, 1
their, 1
juvenile, 1
propensities--these, 1
two, 1
children, 1
are, 1
impediments, 1
in, 1
my, 1
way, 1
of, 1
promoting, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English, 1
people,, 1
whose, 1
unhappiness, 1
they, 1
(the, 1
children), 1
would, 1
infallibly, 1
have, 1
caused.', 1
Thus, 1
was, 1
Lady, 1
Macbeth, 1
served, 1
by, 1
her, 1
conscience,, 1
when, 1
she, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
give, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
(whatever, 1
Shakespeare, 1
may, 1
say),, 1
a, 1
throne., 1
Ah,, 1
maternal, 1
love, 1
is, 1
a, 1
great, 1
virtue,, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
motive--so, 1
powerful, 1
that, 1
it, 1
excuses, 1
a, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
things,, 1
even, 1
if,, 1
after, 1
Duncan's, 1
death,, 1
Lady, 1
Macbeth, 1
had, 1
been, 1
at, 1
all, 1
pricked, 1
by, 1
her, 1
conscience.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
listened, 1
with, 1
avidity, 1
to, 1
these, 1
appalling, 1
maxims, 1
and, 1
horrible, 1
paradoxes,, 1
delivered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
that, 1
ironical, 1
simplicity, 1
which, 1
was, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
him., 1
After, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
the, 1
lady, 1
inquired,, 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
very, 1
terrible, 1
reasoner,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
world, 1
through, 1
a, 1
somewhat, 1
distempered, 1
medium?, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
really, 1
measured, 1
the, 1
world, 1
by, 1
scrutinies,, 1
or, 1
through, 1
alembics, 1
and, 1
crucibles?, 1
For, 1
you, 1
must, 1
indeed, 1
be, 1
a, 1
great, 1
chemist,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
elixir, 1
you, 1
administered, 1
to, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
which, 1
recalled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
life, 1
almost, 1
instantaneously"--, 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
place, 1
any, 1
reliance, 1
on, 1
that,, 1
madame;, 1
one, 1
drop, 1
of, 1
that, 1
elixir, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
life, 1
to, 1
a, 1
dying, 1
child,, 1
but, 1
three, 1
drops, 1
would, 1
have, 1
impelled, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
into, 1
his, 1
lungs, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
way, 1
as, 1
to, 1
have, 1
produced, 1
most, 1
violent, 1
palpitations;, 1
six, 1
would, 1
have, 1
suspended, 1
his, 1
respiration,, 1
and, 1
caused, 1
syncope, 1
more, 1
serious, 1
than, 1
that, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was;, 1
ten, 1
would, 1
have, 1
destroyed, 1
him., 1
You, 1
know,, 1
madame,, 1
how, 1
suddenly, 1
I, 1
snatched, 1
him, 1
from, 1
those, 1
phials, 1
which, 1
he, 1
so, 1
imprudently, 1
touched?", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
then, 1
so, 1
terrible, 1
a, 1
poison?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no., 1
In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
agree, 1
that, 1
the, 1
word, 1
poison, 1
does, 1
not, 1
exist,, 1
because, 1
in, 1
medicine, 1
use, 1
is, 1
made, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
violent, 1
poisons,, 1
which, 1
become,, 1
according, 1
as, 1
they, 1
are, 1
employed,, 1
most, 1
salutary, 1
remedies.", 1
"What,, 1
then,, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"A, 1
skilful, 1
preparation, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friend's, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
Abbe, 1
Adelmonte,, 1
who, 1
taught, 1
me, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Oh,", 1
observed, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
an, 1
admirable, 1
anti-spasmodic.", 1
"Perfect,, 1
madame,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
frequently, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
it--with, 1
all, 1
possible, 1
prudence, 1
though,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
observed,", 1
he, 1
added, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
intelligence., 1
"Most, 1
assuredly,", 1
responded, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone., 1
"As, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
so, 1
nervous,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
subject, 1
to, 1
fainting, 1
fits,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
require, 1
a, 1
Doctor, 1
Adelmonte, 1
to, 1
invent, 1
for, 1
me, 1
some, 1
means, 1
of, 1
breathing, 1
freely, 1
and, 1

Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
again,, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
rejection, 1
of, 1

sent, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
intimation, 1
that, 1

should, 1
probably, 1
do, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
joining, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1

her, 1
daughter, 1
during, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1

event, 1
of, 1
their, 1
accepting, 1
the, 1
box, 1
in, 1
question., 1

ladies, 1
received, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
with, 1
too, 1
much, 1
pleasure, 1
to, 1
dream, 1
of, 1
a, 1
refusal., 1
To, 1
no, 1
class, 1
of, 1
persons, 1
is, 1
the, 1
presentation, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gratuitous, 1
opera-box, 1
more, 1
acceptable, 1

still, 1
hugs, 1
economy, 1

boasting, 1
of, 1

king's, 1
ransom, 1
in, 1
his, 1
waistcoat, 1
pocket., 1
Danglars, 1
had,, 1
however,, 1
protested, 1
against, 1
showing, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
ministerial, 1
box,, 1
declaring, 1
that, 1
his, 1
political, 1
principles,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
parliamentary, 1
position, 1
as, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opposition, 1
party, 1
would, 1
not, 1
permit, 1
him, 1
so, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
himself;, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
had,, 1
therefore,, 1
despatched, 1
a, 1
note, 1
to, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray,, 1
bidding, 1
him, 1
call, 1
for, 1
them,, 1
it, 1
being, 1
wholly, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
her, 1
to, 1
go, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Eugenie, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opera., 1
There, 1
is, 1
no, 1
gainsaying, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
a, 1
very, 1
unfavorable, 1
construction, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
put, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
circumstance, 1
if, 1
the, 1
two, 1
women, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
without, 1
escort,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
addition, 1
of, 1
a, 1
third,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
person, 1
of, 1
her, 1
mother's, 1
admitted, 1
lover,, 1
enabled, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
defy, 1
malice, 1
and, 1
ill-nature., 1
One, 1
must, 1
take, 1
the, 1
world, 1
as, 1
one, 1
finds, 1
it., 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
rose,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
to, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
empty, 1
house,, 1
it, 1
being, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
absurdities, 1
of, 1
Parisian, 1
fashion, 1
never, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
until, 1
after, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
performance,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
played, 1
without, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
attention, 1
being, 1
paid, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
audience, 1
already, 1
assembled, 1
being, 1
too, 1
much, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
observing, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
arrivals,, 1
while, 1
nothing, 1
is, 1
heard, 1
but, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
opening, 1
and, 1
shutting, 1
doors,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
buzz, 1
of, 1
conversation., 1
"Surely,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
a, 1
box, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
circle, 1
opened,, 1
"that, 1
must, 1
be, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
is, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----?", 1
inquired, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"What, 1
a, 1
question!, 1
Now,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
baron,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
great, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
pick, 1
a, 1
quarrel, 1
with, 1
you, 1
for, 1
asking, 1
it;, 1
as, 1
if, 1
all, 1
the, 1
world, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
who, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----, 1
was.", 1
"Ah,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sure,", 1
replied, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"the, 1
lovely, 1
Venetian,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Herself.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
perceived, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
his, 1
salutation, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
her,, 1
it, 1
seems?", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Franz, 1
introduced, 1
me, 1
to, 1
her, 1
at, 1
Rome,", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
do, 1
as, 1
much, 1
for, 1
me, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
as, 1
Franz, 1
did, 1
for, 1
you, 1
in, 1
Rome?", 1
"With, 1
pleasure.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
"Shut, 1
up!", 1
from, 1
the, 1
audience., 1
This, 1
manifestation, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
of, 1
their, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
music,, 1
produced, 1
not, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
continued, 1
their, 1
conversation., 1
"The, 1
countess, 1
was, 1
present, 1
at, 1
the, 1
races, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champ-de-Mars,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"To-day?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Bless, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
quite, 1
forgot, 1
the, 1
races., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
bet?", 1
"Oh,, 1
merely, 1
a, 1
paltry, 1
fifty, 1
louis.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
was, 1
the, 1
winner?", 1
"Nautilus., 1
I, 1
staked, 1
on, 1
him.", 1
"But, 1
there, 1
were, 1
three, 1
races,, 1
were, 1
there, 1
not?", 1
"Yes;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
the, 1
prize, 1
given, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Jockey, 1
Club--a, 1
gold, 1
cup,, 1
you, 1
know--and, 1
a, 1
very, 1
singular, 1
circumstance, 1

about, 1
that, 1
race.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
it?", 1
"Oh,, 1
shut, 1
up!", 1
again, 1
interposed, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
audience., 1
"Why,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
won, 1
by, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
and, 1
rider, 1
utterly, 1
unknown, 1
on, 1
the, 1
course.", 1
"Is, 1
that, 1
possible?", 1
"True, 1
as, 1
day., 1

fact, 1
was,, 1

horse, 1
and, 1
jockey, 1
belonged?", 1
"No.", 1
"You, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
was, 1
entered, 1
under, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Vampa?", 1
"Exactly;, 1
that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
title.", 1
"Then,", 1
answered, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
better, 1
informed, 1
than, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
and, 1
know, 1
who, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
that, 1
horse, 1
was.", 1
"Shut, 1
up,, 1
there!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
pit, 1
in, 1
chorus., 1
And, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
command, 1
was, 1
given,, 1
betokened, 1
such, 1
growing, 1
hostility, 1
that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
perceived,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mandate, 1
was, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
them., 1
Leisurely, 1
turning, 1
round,, 1
they, 1
calmly, 1
scrutinized, 1
the, 1
various, 1
countenances, 1
around, 1
them,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
demanding, 1
some, 1
one, 1
person, 1
who, 1
would, 1
take, 1
upon, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
responsibility, 1
of, 1
what, 1
they, 1
deemed, 1
excessive, 1
impertinence;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
no, 1
one, 1
responded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
challenge,, 1
the, 1
friends, 1
turned, 1
again, 1
to, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
theatre,, 1
and, 1
affected, 1
to, 1
busy, 1
themselves, 1
with, 1
the, 1
stage., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
box, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
entered,, 1
escorted, 1
by, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
assiduously, 1
conducted, 1
them, 1
to, 1
their, 1
seats., 1
"Ha,, 1
ha,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"here, 1
comes, 1
some, 1
friends, 1
of, 1
yours,, 1
viscount!, 1
What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
there?, 1
don't, 1
you, 1
see, 1
they, 1
are, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
your, 1
eye?", 1
Albert, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
just, 1
in, 1
time, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
a, 1
gracious, 1
wave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fan, 1
from, 1
the, 1
baroness;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie,, 1
she, 1
scarcely, 1
vouchsafed, 1
to, 1
waste, 1
the, 1
glances, 1
of, 1
her, 1
large, 1
black, 1
eyes, 1
even, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
business, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stage., 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
imagine, 1
what, 1
objection, 1
you, 1
can, 1
possibly, 1
have, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars--that, 1
is,, 1
setting, 1
aside, 1
her, 1
want, 1
of, 1
ancestry, 1
and, 1
somewhat, 1
inferior, 1
rank,, 1
which, 1
by, 1
the, 1
way, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
think, 1
you, 1
care, 1
very, 1
much, 1
about., 1
Now,, 1
barring, 1
all, 1
that,, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
she, 1
is, 1
a, 1
deuced, 1
fine, 1
girl!", 1
"Handsome,, 1
certainly,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"but, 1
not, 1
to, 1
my, 1
taste,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
inclines, 1
to, 1
something, 1
softer,, 1
gentler,, 1
and, 1
more, 1
feminine.", 1
"Ah,, 1
well,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
who, 1
because, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
thirtieth, 1
summer, 1
fancied, 1
himself, 1
duly, 1
warranted, 1
in, 1
assuming, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
paternal, 1
air, 1
with, 1
his, 1
more, 1
youthful, 1
friend,, 1
"you, 1
young, 1
people, 1
are, 1
never, 1
satisfied;, 1
why,, 1
what, 1
would, 1
you, 1
have, 1
more?, 1
your, 1
parents, 1
have, 1
chosen, 1
you, 1
a, 1
bride, 1
built, 1
on, 1
the, 1
model, 1
of, 1
Diana,, 1
the, 1
huntress,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
content.", 1
"No,, 1
for, 1
that, 1
very, 1
resemblance, 1
affrights, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
liked, 1
something, 1
more, 1
in, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Venus, 1
of, 1
Milo, 1
or, 1
Capua;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
chase-loving, 1
Diana, 1
continually, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
her, 1
nymphs, 1
gives, 1
me, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
alarm, 1
lest, 1
she, 1
should, 1
some, 1
day, 1
bring, 1
on, 1
me, 1
the, 1
fate, 1
of, 1
Actaeon.", 1
And,, 1
indeed,, 1
it, 1
required, 1
but, 1
one, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
comprehend, 1
the, 1
justness, 1
of, 1
Morcerf's, 1
remark--she, 1
was, 1
beautiful,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
beauty, 1
was, 1
of, 1
too, 1
marked, 1
and, 1
decided, 1
a, 1
character, 1
to, 1
please, 1
a, 1
fastidious, 1
taste;, 1
her, 1
hair, 1
was, 1
raven, 1
black,, 1
but, 1
its, 1
natural, 1
waves, 1
seemed, 1
somewhat, 1
rebellious;, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
color, 1
as, 1
her, 1
hair,, 1
were, 1
surmounted, 1
by, 1
well-arched, 1
brows,, 1
whose, 1
great, 1
defect,, 1
however,, 1
consisted, 1
in, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
habitual, 1
frown,, 1
while, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
physiognomy, 1
wore, 1
that, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
firmness, 1
and, 1
decision, 1
so, 1
little, 1
in, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
gentler, 1
attributes, 1
of, 1
her, 1
sex--her, 1
nose, 1
was, 1
precisely, 1
what, 1
a, 1
sculptor, 1
would, 1
have, 1
chosen, 1
for, 1
a, 1
chiselled, 1
Juno., 1
Her, 1
mouth,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
found, 1
fault, 1
with, 1
as, 1
too, 1
large,, 1
displayed, 1
teeth, 1
of, 1
pearly, 1
whiteness,, 1
rendered, 1
still, 1
more, 1
conspicuous, 1
by, 1
the, 1
brilliant, 1
carmine, 1
of, 1
her, 1
lips,, 1
contrasting, 1
vividly, 1
with, 1
her, 1
naturally, 1
pale, 1
complexion., 1
But, 1
that, 1
which, 1
completed, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
masculine, 1
look, 1
Morcerf, 1
found, 1
so, 1
little, 1
to, 1
his, 1
taste,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
mole,, 1
of, 1
much, 1
larger, 1
dimensions, 1
than, 1
these, 1
freaks, 1
of, 1
nature, 1
generally, 1
are,, 1
placed, 1
just, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
her, 1
mouth;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
tended, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
self-dependence, 1
that, 1
characterized, 1
her, 1
countenance., 1
The, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie's, 1
person, 1
was, 1
in, 1
perfect, 1
keeping, 1
with, 1
the, 1
head, 1
just, 1
described;, 1
she,, 1
indeed,, 1
reminded, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Diana,, 1
as, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
observed,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
bearing, 1
was, 1
more, 1
haughty, 1
and, 1
resolute., 1
As, 1
regarded, 1
her, 1
attainments,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
fault, 1
to, 1
be, 1
found, 1
with, 1
them, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
that, 1
a, 1
fastidious, 1
connoisseur, 1
might, 1
have, 1
found, 1
with, 1
her, 1
beauty,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
somewhat, 1
too, 1
erudite, 1
and, 1
masculine, 1
for, 1
so, 1
young, 1
a, 1
person., 1
She, 1
was, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
linguist,, 1
a, 1
first-rate, 1
artist,, 1
wrote, 1
poetry,, 1
and, 1
composed, 1
music;, 1
to, 1
the, 1
study, 1
of, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
she, 1
professed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entirely, 1
devoted,, 1
following, 1
it, 1
with, 1
an, 1
indefatigable, 1
perseverance,, 1
assisted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
schoolfellow,--a, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
without, 1
fortune, 1
whose, 1
talent, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
develop, 1
into, 1
remarkable, 1
powers, 1
as, 1
a, 1
singer., 1
It, 1
was, 1
rumored, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
an, 1
object, 1
of, 1
almost, 1
paternal, 1
interest, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
composers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
who, 1
excited, 1
her, 1
to, 1
spare, 1
no, 1
pains, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cultivation, 1
of, 1
her, 1
voice,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
hereafter, 1
prove, 1
a, 1
source, 1
of, 1
wealth, 1
and, 1
independence., 1
But, 1
this, 1
counsel, 1
effectually, 1
decided, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
never, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
herself, 1
by, 1
being, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
public, 1
with, 1
one, 1
destined, 1
for, 1
a, 1
theatrical, 1
life;, 1
and, 1
acting, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
principle,, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
daughter,, 1
though, 1
perfectly, 1
willing, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly, 1
(that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
virtuosa), 1
to, 1
practice, 1
with, 1
her, 1
through, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
took, 1
especial, 1
care, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
her, 1
company., 1
Still,, 1
though, 1
not, 1
actually, 1
received, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
Danglars, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
an, 1
acknowledged, 1
friend,, 1
Louise, 1
was, 1
treated, 1
with, 1
far, 1
more, 1
kindness, 1
and, 1
consideration, 1
than, 1
is, 1
usually, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
governess., 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
fell, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
after, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
into, 1
her, 1
box,, 1
the, 1
band, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
orchestra, 1
for, 1
the, 1
accustomed, 1
half-hour's, 1
interval, 1
allowed, 1
between, 1
the, 1
acts,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
audience, 1
were, 1
left, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
promenade, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
or, 1
lobbies,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
and, 1
receive, 1
visits, 1
in, 1
their, 1
respective, 1
boxes., 1
Morcerf, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
were, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
avail, 1
themselves, 1
of, 1
this, 1
permission., 1
For, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
struck, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
that, 1
this, 1
eagerness, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
viscount, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
his, 1
impatience, 1
to, 1
join, 1
her, 1
party,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
whispered, 1
her, 1
expectations, 1
to, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
hurrying, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
his, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
them., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie,, 1
however,, 1
merely, 1
returned, 1
a, 1
dissenting, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
while,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
smile,, 1
she, 1
directed, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
her, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
an, 1
opposite, 1
box, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
circle,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
sat, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----,, 1
and, 1
where, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
just, 1
made, 1
his, 1
appearance., 1
"So, 1
we, 1
meet, 1
again,, 1
my, 1
travelling, 1
friend,, 1
do, 1
we?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
extending, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
him, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
warmth, 1
and, 1
cordiality, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
acquaintance;, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
really, 1
very, 1
good, 1
of, 1
you, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
me, 1
so, 1
quickly,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
so, 1
to, 1
bestow, 1
your, 1
first, 1
visit, 1
on, 1
me.", 1
"Be, 1
assured,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
your, 1
arrival, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
known, 1
your, 1
address,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
paid, 1
my, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
you, 1
before, 1
this., 1
Allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
introduce, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
Baron, 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
few, 1
true, 1
gentlemen, 1
now, 1
to, 1
be, 1
found, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
spectator, 1
of, 1
the, 1
races, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champ-de-Mars,, 1
yesterday.", 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"So, 1
you, 1
were, 1
at, 1
the, 1
races,, 1
baron?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
eagerly., 1
"Yes,, 1
madame.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
pursued, 1
Madame, 1
G----, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
animation,, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
probably, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
who, 1
won, 1
the, 1
Jockey, 1
Club, 1
stakes?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sorry, 1
to, 1
say, 1
I, 1
cannot,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
baron;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
just, 1
asking, 1
the, 1
same, 1
question, 1
of, 1
Albert.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
very, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
know,, 1
countess?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"To, 1
know, 1
what?", 1
"The, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
winning, 1
horse?", 1
"Excessively;, 1
only, 1
imagine--but, 1
do, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
viscount,, 1
whether, 1
you, 1
really, 1
are, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
it, 1
or, 1
no?", 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
pardon,, 1
madame,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
some, 1
story,, 1
were, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
You, 1
said,, 1
'only, 1
imagine,'--and, 1
then, 1
paused., 1
Pray, 1
continue.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
listen., 1
You, 1
must, 1
know, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
so, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
roan, 1
horse,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
elegant, 1
little, 1
rider,, 1
so, 1
tastefully, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
pink, 1
satin, 1
jacket, 1
and, 1
cap,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
help, 1
praying, 1
for, 1
their, 1
success, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
earnestness, 1
as, 1
though, 1
the, 1
half, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
were, 1
at, 1
stake;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
them, 1
outstrip, 1
all, 1
the, 1
others,, 1
and, 1
come, 1
to, 1
the, 1
winning-post, 1
in, 1
such, 1
gallant, 1
style,, 1
I, 1
actually, 1
clapped, 1
my, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
Imagine, 1
my, 1
surprise,, 1
when,, 1
upon, 1
returning, 1
home,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
object, 1
I, 1
met, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
was, 1
the, 1
identical, 1
jockey, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pink, 1
jacket!, 1
I, 1
concluded, 1
that,, 1
by, 1
some, 1
singular, 1
chance,, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
winning, 1
horse, 1
must, 1
live, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hotel, 1
as, 1
myself;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
entered, 1
my, 1
apartments,, 1
I, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
very, 1
gold, 1
cup, 1
awarded, 1
as, 1
a, 1
prize, 1
to, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
horse, 1
and, 1
rider., 1
Inside, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
was, 1
a, 1
small, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
paper,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
were, 1
written, 1
these, 1
words--'From, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven, 1
to, 1
Countess, 1
G----.'", 1
"Precisely;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Sure, 1
of, 1
what?", 1
"That, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
was, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven, 1
himself.", 1
"What, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"Why,, 1
our, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven--the, 1
Vampire, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Salle, 1
Argentino!", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible?", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
"is, 1
he, 1
here, 1
in, 1
Paris?", 1
"To, 1
be, 1
sure,--why, 1
not?", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
visit, 1
him?--meet, 1
him, 1
at, 1
your, 1
own, 1
house, 1
and, 1
elsewhere?", 1
"I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
he, 1
is, 1
my, 1
most, 1
intimate, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
has, 1
also, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
his, 1
acquaintance.", 1
"But, 1
why, 1
are, 1
you, 1
so, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
his, 1
being, 1
the, 1
winner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Jockey, 1
Club, 1
prize?", 1
"Was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
winning, 1
horse, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Vampa?", 1
"What, 1
of, 1
that?", 1
"Why,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
recollect, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
celebrated, 1
bandit, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
was, 1
made, 1
prisoner?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes.", 1
"And, 1
from, 1
whose, 1
hands, 1
the, 1
count, 1
extricated, 1
me, 1
in, 1
so, 1
wonderful, 1
a, 1
manner?", 1
"To, 1
be, 1
sure,, 1
I, 1
remember, 1
it, 1
all, 1
now.", 1
"He, 1
called, 1
himself, 1
Vampa., 1
You, 1
see,, 1
it's, 1
evident, 1
where, 1
the, 1
count, 1
got, 1
the, 1
name.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
could, 1
have, 1
been, 1
his, 1
motive, 1
for, 1
sending, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
place,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
much, 1
of, 1
you, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
believe;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
second,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
see, 1
a, 1
countrywoman, 1
take, 1
so, 1
lively, 1
an, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
his, 1
success.", 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
and, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
never, 1
repeated, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
all, 1
the, 1
foolish, 1
remarks, 1
we, 1
used, 1
to, 1
make, 1
about, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1
affirm, 1
upon, 1
oath, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not., 1
Besides,, 1
his, 1
presenting, 1
you, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
under, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Lord, 1
Ruthven"--, 1
"Oh,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
is, 1
dreadful!, 1
Why,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
must, 1
owe, 1
me, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
grudge.", 1
"Does, 1
his, 1
action, 1
appear, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
an, 1
enemy?", 1
"No;, 1
certainly, 1
not.", 1
"Well,, 1
then"--, 1
"And, 1
so, 1
he, 1
is, 1
in, 1
Paris?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
effect, 1
does, 1
he, 1
produce?", 1
"Why,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
talked, 1
about, 1
for, 1
a, 1
week;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
coronation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
queen, 1
of, 1
England, 1
took, 1
place,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
theft, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Mars's, 1
diamonds;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
people, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
something, 1
else.", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"the, 1
count, 1
is, 1
your, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
you, 1
treat, 1
him, 1
accordingly., 1
Do, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
what, 1
Albert, 1
is, 1
telling, 1
you,, 1
countess;, 1
so, 1
far, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
excited, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
circles, 1
by, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
having, 1
abated,, 1
I, 1
take, 1
upon, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
declare, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
as, 1
strong, 1
as, 1
ever., 1
His, 1
first, 1
astounding, 1
act, 1
upon, 1
coming, 1
amongst, 1
us, 1
was, 1
to, 1
present, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
horses,, 1
worth, 1
32,000, 1
francs,, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
his, 1
second,, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
miraculous, 1
preservation, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
life;, 1
now, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
the, 1
prize, 1
awarded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Jockey, 1
Club., 1
I, 1
therefore, 1
maintain,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
that, 1
not, 1
only, 1
is, 1
the, 1
count, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
interest, 1
at, 1
this, 1
present, 1
moment,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
that, 1
he, 1
will, 1
continue, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so, 1
for, 1
a, 1
month, 1
longer, 1
if, 1
he, 1
pleases, 1
to, 1
exhibit, 1
an, 1
eccentricity, 1
of, 1
conduct, 1
which,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
may, 1
be, 1
his, 1
ordinary, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
existence.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf;, 1
"meanwhile,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Russian, 1
ambassador's, 1
box?", 1
"Which, 1
box, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"The, 1
one, 1
between, 1
the, 1
pillars, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
tier--it, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
fitted, 1
up, 1
entirely, 1
afresh.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
observe, 1
any, 1
one, 1
during, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act?", 1
asked, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Where?", 1
"In, 1
that, 1
box.", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
certainly, 1
empty, 1
during, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act;", 1
then,, 1
resuming, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
their, 1
previous, 1
conversation,, 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"And, 1
so, 1
you, 1
really, 1
believe, 1
it, 1
was, 1
your, 1
mysterious, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
that, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
prize?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
afterwards, 1
sent, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"Undoubtedly.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
him,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
great, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
return, 1
it.", 1
"Do, 1
no, 1
such, 1
thing,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
only, 1
send, 1
you, 1
another,, 1
formed, 1
of, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
sapphire,, 1
or, 1
hollowed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gigantic, 1
ruby., 1
It, 1
is, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
must, 1
take, 1
him, 1
as, 1
you, 1
find, 1
him.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
rang, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
the, 1
drawing, 1
up, 1
of, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
for, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act., 1
Albert, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
his, 1
place., 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
next, 1
act,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
permission,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
and, 1
inquire, 1
whether, 1
there, 1
is, 1
anything, 1
I, 1
can, 1
do, 1
for, 1
you, 1
in, 1
Paris?", 1
"Pray, 1
take, 1
notice,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"that, 1
my, 1
present, 1
residence, 1
is, 1
22, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Rivoli,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
home, 1
to, 1
my, 1
friends, 1
every, 1
Saturday, 1
evening., 1
So, 1
now,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
both, 1
forewarned.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
men, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
box., 1
Upon, 1
reaching, 1
their, 1
stalls,, 1
they, 1
found, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
audience, 1
in, 1
the, 1
parterre, 1
standing, 1
up, 1
and, 1
directing, 1
their, 1
gaze, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
box, 1
formerly, 1
possessed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Russian, 1
ambassador., 1
A, 1
man, 1
of, 1
from, 1
thirty-five, 1
to, 1
forty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
black,, 1
had, 1
just, 1
entered,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
dressed, 1
after, 1
the, 1
Eastern, 1
style., 1
The, 1
lady, 1
was, 1
surpassingly, 1
beautiful,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
rich, 1
magnificence, 1
of, 1
her, 1
attire, 1
drew, 1
all, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
her., 1
"Hullo,", 1
said, 1
Albert;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
his, 1
Greek!", 1
The, 1
strangers, 1
were,, 1
indeed,, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Haidee., 1
In, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
the, 1
occupants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boxes, 1
leaned, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
scrutinize, 1
her, 1
magnificent, 1
diamonds., 1
The, 1
second, 1
act, 1
passed, 1
away, 1
during, 1
one, 1
continued, 1
buzz, 1
of, 1
voices--one, 1
deep, 1
whisper--intimating, 1
that, 1
some, 1
great, 1
and, 1
universally, 1
interesting, 1
event, 1
had, 1
occurred;, 1
all, 1
eyes,, 1
all, 1
thoughts,, 1
were, 1
occupied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
young, 1
and, 1
beautiful, 1
woman,, 1
whose, 1
gorgeous, 1
apparel, 1
and, 1
splendid, 1
jewels, 1
made, 1
a, 1
most, 1
extraordinary, 1
spectacle., 1
Upon, 1
this, 1
occasion, 1
an, 1
unmistakable, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
intimated, 1
her, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
her, 1
box, 1
directly, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act,, 1
and, 1
neither, 1
the, 1
politeness, 1
nor, 1
good, 1
taste, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
would, 1
permit, 1
his, 1
neglecting, 1
an, 1
invitation, 1
so, 1
unequivocally, 1
given., 1
At, 1
the, 1
close, 1
of, 1
the, 1
act, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
Having, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
ladies,, 1
he, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Debray., 1
By, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
he, 1
was, 1
most, 1
graciously, 1
welcomed,, 1
while, 1
Eugenie, 1
received, 1
him, 1
with, 1
her, 1
accustomed, 1
coldness., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
come, 1
in, 1
the, 1
nick, 1
of, 1
time., 1
There, 1
is, 1
madame, 1
overwhelming, 1
me, 1
with, 1
questions, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
she, 1
insists, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
that, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
her, 1
his, 1
birth,, 1
education,, 1
and, 1
parentage,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
came, 1
from,, 1
and, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
is, 1
going., 1
Being, 1
no, 1
disciple, 1
of, 1
Cagliostro,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
wholly, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
do, 1
this;, 1
so,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
getting, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scrape,, 1
I, 1
said,, 1
'Ask, 1
Morcerf;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
got, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
history, 1
of, 1
his, 1
beloved, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
his, 1
fingers', 1
ends;', 1
whereupon, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
signified, 1
her, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
almost, 1
incredible,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that, 1
a, 1
person, 1
having, 1
at, 1
least, 1
half, 1
a, 1
million, 1
of, 1
secret-service, 1
money, 1
at, 1
his, 1
command,, 1
should, 1
possess, 1
so, 1
little, 1
information?", 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Lucien,, 1
"that, 1
had, 1
I, 1
really, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
you, 1
mention, 1
at, 1
my, 1
disposal,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
employ, 1
it, 1
more, 1
profitably, 1

in, 1
troubling, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
particulars, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
whose, 1
only, 1
merit, 1
in, 1
my, 1
eyes, 1
consists, 1
in, 1
his, 1
being, 1
twice, 1
as, 1
rich, 1
as, 1
a, 1
nabob., 1
However,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
turned, 1
the, 1
business, 1
over, 1
to, 1
Morcerf,, 1

settle, 1
it, 1
with, 1
him, 1
as, 1
may, 1
be, 1
most, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
for, 1
my, 1
own, 1
part,, 1
I, 1
care, 1

his, 1
mysterious, 1
doings.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
sure, 1
no, 1
nabob, 1
would, 1
have, 1
sent, 1
me, 1

of, 1
horses, 1

at, 1
5,000, 1
francs, 1
each.", 1
"He, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
mania, 1
for, 1
diamonds,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
smiling,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
verily, 1
believe, 1
that,, 1
like, 1
Potemkin,, 1
he, 1
keeps, 1
his, 1
pockets, 1
filled,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
strewing, 1
them, 1
along, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
as, 1
Tom, 1
Thumb, 1
did, 1
his, 1
flint, 1
stones.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
he, 1
has, 1
discovered, 1
some, 1
mine,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"I, 1
suppose, 1
you, 1
know, 1
he, 1
has, 1
an, 1
order, 1
for, 1
unlimited, 1
credit, 1
on, 1
the, 1
baron's, 1
banking, 1
establishment?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
can, 1
readily, 1
believe, 1
it.", 1
"And,, 1
further,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
stated, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
his, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
only, 1
staying, 1
a, 1
year, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
time, 1
he, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
six, 1
millions., 1
"He, 1
must, 1
be, 1
the, 1
Shah, 1
of, 1
Persia,, 1
travelling, 1
incog.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
remarkable, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
woman,, 1
M., 1
Lucien?", 1
inquired, 1
Eugenie., 1
"I, 1
really, 1
never, 1
met, 1
with, 1
one, 1
woman, 1
so, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
do, 1
justice, 1
to, 1
the, 1
charms, 1
of, 1
another, 1
as, 1
yourself,", 1
responded, 1
Lucien,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
lorgnette, 1
to, 1
his, 1
eye., 1
"A, 1
most, 1
lovely, 1
creature,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
soul!", 1
was, 1
his, 1
verdict., 1
"Who, 1
is, 1
this, 1
young, 1
person,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf?", 1
inquired, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"does, 1
anybody, 1
know?", 1
"Mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
replying, 1
to, 1
this, 1
direct, 1
appeal,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
give, 1
you, 1
very, 1
exact, 1
information, 1
on, 1
that, 1
subject,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
on, 1
most, 1
points, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
person, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
are, 1
now, 1
conversing--the, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
is, 1
a, 1
Greek.", 1
"So, 1
I, 1
should, 1
suppose, 1
by, 1
her, 1
dress;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
know, 1
no, 1
more, 1
than, 1
that,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
here, 1
is, 1
as, 1
well-informed, 1
as, 1
yourself.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
extremely, 1
sorry, 1
you, 1
find, 1
me, 1
so, 1
ignorant, 1
a, 1
cicerone,", 1
replied, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
am, 1
reluctantly, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
confess,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
further, 1
to, 1
communicate--yes,, 1
stay,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
know, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
more,, 1
namely,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
is, 1
a, 1
musician,, 1
for, 1
one, 1
day, 1
when, 1
I, 1
chanced, 1
to, 1
be, 1
breakfasting, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
guzla--it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
that, 1
it, 1
could, 1
have, 1
been, 1
touched, 1
by, 1
any, 1
other, 1
finger, 1
than, 1
her, 1
own.", 1
"Then, 1
your, 1
count, 1
entertains, 1
visitors,, 1
does, 1
he?", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Indeed, 1
he, 1
does,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
most, 1
lavish, 1
manner,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
must, 1
try, 1
and, 1
persuade, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
invite, 1
him, 1
to, 1
a, 1
ball, 1
or, 1
dinner,, 1
or, 1
something, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sort,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
may, 1
be, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
us, 1
in, 1
return.", 1
"What,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
laughing;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
really, 1
mean, 1
you, 1
would, 1
go, 1
to, 1
his, 1
house?", 1
"Why, 1
not?, 1
my, 1
husband, 1
could, 1
accompany, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this, 1
mysterious, 1
count, 1
is, 1
a, 1
bachelor?", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
ample, 1
proof, 1
to, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
look, 1
opposite,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
laughingly, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek., 1
"No,, 1
no!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Debray;, 1
"that, 1
girl, 1
is, 1
not, 1
his, 1
wife:, 1
he, 1
told, 1
us, 1
himself, 1
she, 1
was, 1
his, 1
slave., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
recollect,, 1
Morcerf,, 1
his, 1
telling, 1
us, 1
so, 1
at, 1
your, 1
breakfast?", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"if, 1
slave, 1
she, 1
be,, 1
she, 1
has, 1
all, 1
the, 1
air, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
princess.", 1
"Of, 1
the, 1
'Arabian, 1
Nights'?", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
like;, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Lucien,, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
that, 1
constitutes, 1
a, 1
princess., 1
Why,, 1
diamonds--and, 1
she, 1
is, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
them.", 1
"To, 1
me, 1
she, 1
seems, 1
overloaded,", 1
observed, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"she, 1
would, 1
look, 1
far, 1
better, 1
if, 1
she, 1
wore, 1
fewer,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
should, 1
then, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
see, 1
her, 1
finely, 1
formed, 1
throat, 1
and, 1
wrists.", 1
"See, 1
how, 1
the, 1
artist, 1
peeps, 1
out!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"My, 1
poor, 1
Eugenie,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
conceal, 1
your, 1
passion, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
arts.", 1
"I, 1
admire, 1
all, 1
that, 1
is, 1
beautiful,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count?", 1
inquired, 1
Debray;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
much, 1
amiss,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
my, 1
ideas, 1
of, 1
good, 1
looks.", 1
"The, 1
count,", 1
repeated, 1
Eugenie,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
it, 1
had, 1
not, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
her, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
him, 1
sooner;, 1
"the, 1
count?--oh,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
so, 1
dreadfully, 1
pale.", 1
"I, 1
quite, 1
agree, 1
with, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf;, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
that, 1
very, 1
pallor, 1
is, 1
what, 1
we, 1
want, 1
to, 1
find, 1
out., 1
The, 1
Countess, 1
G----, 1
insists, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
vampire.", 1
"Then, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
G----, 1
has, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
has, 1
she?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"Is, 1
that, 1
she,, 1
mamma?", 1
asked, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"almost, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
profusion, 1
of, 1
beautiful, 1
light, 1
hair?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
she., 1
Shall, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what, 1
you, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
Morcerf?", 1
"Command, 1
me,, 1
madame.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
should, 1
go, 1
and, 1
bring, 1
your, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
us.", 1
"What, 1
for?", 1
asked, 1
Eugenie., 1
"What, 1
for?, 1
Why,, 1
to, 1
converse, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
of, 1
course., 1
Have, 1
you, 1
really, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him?", 1
"None, 1
whatever,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie., 1
"Strange, 1
child,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"He, 1
will, 1
very, 1
probably, 1
come, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
accord,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf., 1
"There;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
madame,, 1
he, 1
recognizes, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
bows.", 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
salute, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
smiling, 1
and, 1
graceful, 1
manner., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"I, 1
may, 1
as, 1
well, 1
be, 1
magnanimous,, 1
and, 1
tear, 1
myself, 1
away, 1
to, 1
forward, 1
your, 1
wishes., 1
Adieu;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
try, 1
if, 1
there, 1
are, 1
any, 1
means, 1
of, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"Go, 1
straight, 1
to, 1
his, 1
box;, 1
that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
simplest, 1
plan.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
been, 1
presented.", 1
"Presented, 1
to, 1
whom?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek.", 1
"You, 1
say, 1
she, 1
is, 1
only, 1
a, 1
slave?", 1
"While, 1
you, 1
assert, 1
that, 1
she, 1
is, 1
a, 1
queen,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
princess., 1
No;, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
that, 1
when, 1
he, 1
sees, 1
me, 1
leave, 1
you,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
come, 1
out.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
possible--go.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
going,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
made, 1
his, 1
parting, 1
bow., 1
Just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
box,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
came, 1
forth., 1
After, 1
giving, 1
some, 1
directions, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lobby,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
took, 1
Albert's, 1
arm., 1
Carefully, 1
closing, 1
the, 1
box, 1
door,, 1
Ali, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
before, 1
it,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
spectators, 1
assembled, 1
round, 1
the, 1
Nubian., 1
"Upon, 1
my, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"Paris, 1
is, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
city,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Parisians, 1
a, 1
very, 1
singular, 1
people., 1
See, 1
that, 1
cluster, 1
of, 1
persons, 1
collected, 1
around, 1
poor, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
as, 1
much, 1
astonished, 1
as, 1
themselves;, 1
really, 1
one, 1
might, 1
suppose, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
Nubian, 1
they, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
beheld., 1
Now, 1
I, 1
can, 1
promise, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
Frenchman, 1
might, 1
show, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
public,, 1
either, 1
in, 1
Tunis,, 1
Constantinople,, 1
Bagdad,, 1

Cairo,, 1

shows, 1
that, 1

However,, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
Ali, 1
is, 1
concerned,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
he, 1
excites, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
from, 1
the, 1
circumstance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
being, 1
your, 1

what, 1
has, 1
procured, 1
me, 1
so, 1
fluttering, 1
a, 1
distinction?", 1
"What?, 1
why,, 1
yourself,, 1

be, 1

away, 1
horses, 1

who, 1
has, 1
filled, 1
your, 1
head, 1
with, 1
all, 1
this, 1
nonsense?", 1

in, 1
the, 1
first, 1

heard, 1
it, 1
from, 1
Madame, 1

learned, 1
it, 1
from, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
journal;, 1

thirdly,, 1
from, 1
my, 1
own, 1
imagination., 1
Why,, 1

did, 1
you, 1
call, 1

horse, 1

was, 1
an, 1
oversight,, 1
certainly,", 1

the, 1

of, 1
the, 1

slave,, 1

rendered, 1
this, 1
service, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"Was, 1
it, 1
Ali,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"who, 1
rescued, 1
my, 1
son, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1

"No,, 1
count,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
held, 1
out, 1
to, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
general;, 1

almost, 1

to, 1

of, 1

you, 1
are, 1
no, 1
stranger--at, 1

not, 1
by, 1

Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
last, 1
two, 1

three, 1
days, 1

really, 1
talked, 1

the, 1
baroness,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1

is, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
The, 1
Count, 1
bowed,, 1
while, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
bent, 1
her, 1
head, 1
slightly., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
young, 1
person, 1
with, 1
you, 1
to-night,, 1
count,", 1

Eugenie., 1
"Is, 1
she, 1
your, 1
daughter?", 1
"No,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
astonished, 1
at, 1
the, 1
coolness, 1
and, 1
freedom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
question., 1
"She, 1
is, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
unfortunate, 1
Greek, 1
left, 1
under, 1
my, 1
care.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
her, 1
name?", 1
"Haidee,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"A, 1
Greek?", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
"and, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
see, 1
at, 1
the, 1
court, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Tepelini,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
so, 1
gloriously, 1
and, 1
valiantly, 1
served,, 1
a, 1
more, 1
exquisite, 1
beauty, 1

richer, 1
costume?", 1
"Did, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
rightly,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
served, 1
at, 1
Yanina?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
inspector-general, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pasha's, 1
troops,", 1
replied, 1
Morcerf;, 1
"and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
secret, 1
that, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
my, 1
fortune,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
it, 1
is,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
liberality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
Albanese, 1
chief.", 1
"But, 1
look!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Where?", 1
stammered, 1
Morcerf., 1
"There,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
around, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
leaning, 1
with, 1
him, 1
over, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Haidee,, 1
whose, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
theatre, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
her, 1
guardian,, 1
perceived, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
features, 1
close, 1
to, 1
Morcerf's, 1
face., 1
It, 1
was, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Medusa., 1
She, 1
bent, 1
forwards, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
herself, 1
of, 1
the, 1
reality, 1
of, 1
what, 1
she, 1
saw,, 1
then,, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
cry,, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
back, 1
in, 1
her, 1
seat., 1
The, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
the, 1
people, 1
about, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
instantly, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
box-door., 1
"Why,, 1
count,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"what, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
your, 1
ward?, 1
she, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
suddenly, 1
ill.", 1
"Very, 1
probably,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"But, 1
do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed, 1
on, 1
her, 1
account., 1
Haidee's, 1
nervous, 1
system, 1
is, 1
delicately, 1
organized,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
is, 1
peculiarly, 1
susceptible, 1
to, 1
the, 1
odors, 1
even, 1
of, 1
flowers--nay,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
some, 1
which, 1
cause, 1
her, 1
to, 1
faint, 1
if, 1
brought, 1
into, 1
her, 1
presence., 1
However,", 1
continued, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
drawing, 1
a, 1
small, 1
phial, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
an, 1
infallible, 1
remedy.", 1
So, 1
saying,, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
parting, 1
shake, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
Debray, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
box., 1
Upon, 1
his, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Haidee, 1
he, 1
found, 1
her, 1
still, 1
very, 1
pale., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
she, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
her, 1
own, 1
hands, 1
were, 1
moist, 1
and, 1
icy, 1
cold., 1
"Who, 1
was, 1
it, 1
you, 1
were, 1
talking, 1
with, 1
over, 1
there?", 1
she, 1
asked., 1
"With, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,", 1
answered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"He, 1
tells, 1
me, 1
he, 1
served, 1
your, 1
illustrious, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
owes, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"Wretch!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Haidee,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
flashing, 1
with, 1
rage;, 1
"he, 1
sold, 1
my, 1
father, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Turks,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fortune, 1
he, 1
boasts, 1
of, 1
was, 1
the, 1
price, 1
of, 1
his, 1
treachery!, 1
Did, 1
not, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
lord?", 1
"Something, 1
of, 1
this, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
Epirus,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"but, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
are, 1
still, 1
unknown, 1

You, 1
shall, 1
relate, 1
them, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
child., 1
They, 1
are,, 1
no, 1

both, 1
curious, 1
and, 1
interesting.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes;, 1
but, 1
let, 1
us, 1
go., 1
I, 1
feel, 1
as, 1

it, 1
would, 1
kill, 1
me, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
long, 1
near, 1
that, 1
dreadful, 1

So, 1

arose,, 1

wrapping, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
her, 1
burnoose, 1
of, 1
white, 1
cashmire, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
pearls, 1

coral,, 1
she, 1
hastily, 1
quitted, 1

Stocks., 1
Some, 1
days, 1
after, 1
this, 1

Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
visited, 1
the, 1
Count, 1

at, 1
his, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,, 1

had, 1
already, 1
assumed, 1
that, 1
palace-like, 1
appearance, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
princely, 1
fortune, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1

He, 1
came, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
the, 1
thanks, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
already, 1
conveyed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
through, 1
the, 1
medium, 1
of, 1
a, 1
letter,, 1
signed, 1
"Baronne, 1
Danglars,, 1
nee, 1
Hermine, 1
de, 1
Servieux.", 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray,, 1
who,, 1
joining, 1
in, 1
his, 1
friend's, 1
conversation,, 1
added, 1
some, 1
passing, 1
compliments,, 1
the, 1
source, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
talent, 1
for, 1
finesse, 1
easily, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
guess., 1
He, 1
was, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
Lucien's, 1
visit, 1
was, 1
due, 1
to, 1
a, 1
double, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
curiosity,, 1
the, 1
larger, 1
half, 1
of, 1
which, 1
sentiment, 1
emanated, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Chaussee, 1
d'Antin., 1
In, 1
short,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
not, 1
being, 1
able, 1
personally, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
in, 1
detail, 1
the, 1
domestic, 1
economy, 1
and, 1
household, 1
arrangements, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
away, 1
horses, 1
worth, 1
30,000, 1
francs, 1
and, 1
who, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
with, 1
a, 1
Greek, 1
slave, 1
wearing, 1
diamonds, 1
to, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
a, 1
million, 1
of, 1
money,, 1
had, 1
deputed, 1
those, 1
eyes,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
she, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
her, 1
a, 1
faithful, 1
account, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
life, 1
of, 1
this, 1
incomprehensible, 1
person., 1
But, 1
the, 1
count, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
suspect, 1
that, 1
there, 1
could, 1
be, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
connection, 1
between, 1
Lucien's, 1
visit, 1
and, 1
the, 1
curiosity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
communication, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars?", 1
the, 1
count, 1
inquired, 1
of, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Yes,, 1
count,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you?", 1
"All, 1
remains, 1
the, 1
same,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
that, 1
quarter?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
more, 1
than, 1
ever, 1
a, 1
settled, 1
thing,", 1
said, 1
Lucien,--and,, 1
considering, 1
that, 1
this, 1
remark, 1
was, 1
all, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
that, 1
time, 1
called, 1
upon, 1
to, 1
make,, 1
he, 1
adjusted, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
to, 1
his, 1
eye,, 1
and, 1
biting, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
his, 1
gold, 1
headed, 1
cane,, 1
began, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
tour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pictures., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
that, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
would, 1
be, 1
so, 1
promptly, 1
concluded.", 1
"Oh,, 1
things, 1
take, 1
their, 1
course, 1
without, 1
our, 1
assistance., 1
While, 1
we, 1
are, 1
forgetting, 1
them,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
falling, 1
into, 1
their, 1
appointed, 1
order;, 1
and, 1
when,, 1
again,, 1
our, 1
attention, 1
is, 1
directed, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
the, 1
progress, 1
they, 1
have, 1
made, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
proposed, 1
end., 1
My, 1
father, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
served, 1
together, 1
in, 1
Spain,, 1
my, 1
father, 1
in, 1
the, 1
army, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
in, 1
the, 1
commissariat, 1
department., 1
It, 1
was, 1
there, 1
that, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
ruined, 1
by, 1
the, 1
revolution,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
never, 1
had, 1
possessed, 1
any, 1
patrimony,, 1
both, 1
laid, 1
the, 1
foundations, 1
of, 1
their, 1
different, 1
fortunes.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
mentioned, 1
that, 1
in, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
which, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
him;, 1
and,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
casting, 1
a, 1
side-glance, 1
at, 1
Lucien,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
an, 1
album,, 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
is, 1
pretty--I, 1

that, 1
to, 1

"Very, 1
pretty,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
very, 1
beautiful,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"but, 1
of, 1
that, 1
style, 1
of, 1
beauty, 1

I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

I, 1
am, 1
an, 1
ungrateful, 1
fellow.", 1
"You, 1
speak, 1
as, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
already, 1
her, 1
husband.", 1
"Ah,", 1
returned, 1
Albert,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
looking, 1
around, 1
to, 1
see, 1
what, 1
Lucien, 1
was, 1
doing., 1
"Really,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
lowering, 1
his, 1
voice,, 1
"you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
very, 1
enthusiastic, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
this, 1
marriage.", 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
too, 1
rich, 1
for, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
frightens, 1
me.", 1
"Bah,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that's, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
give., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
rich, 1
yourself?", 1
"My, 1
father's, 1
income, 1
is, 1
about, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
per, 1
annum;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
will, 1
give, 1
me,, 1
perhaps,, 1
ten, 1

twelve, 1
thousand, 1
when, 1
I, 1
marry.", 1
"That,, 1
perhaps,, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
considered, 1
a, 1
large, 1
sum,, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
especially,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"but, 1
everything, 1
does, 1
not, 1
depend, 1
on, 1
wealth,, 1

it, 1
is, 1

Albert, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head,, 1

looked, 1
thoughtful., 1
"There, 1
is, 1
still, 1
something, 1
else,", 1

to, 1

prejudice, 1
against, 1

Danglars.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
somewhat, 1
forced, 1
tone,, 1
"that, 1
may, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
explained;, 1
the, 1
Comtesse, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
aristocracy, 1
and, 1
refinement, 1
itself,, 1

"Real?", 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
smiling., 1
"Oh,, 1
real, 1
enough,, 1

he, 1
to, 1
Debray,, 1

till, 1
to-day,, 1
the, 1
price, 1
would, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
to, 1
205,, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
gaining, 1
300,000, 1
francs,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
20, 1
or, 1
25,000.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
has, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
sudden, 1
fall, 1
from, 1
409, 1
to, 1
206?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
profoundly, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
all, 1
these, 1
stock-jobbing, 1
intrigues.", 1
"Because,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
laughing,, 1
"one, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
news, 1
follows, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
is, 1
often, 1
great, 1
dissimilarity, 1
between, 1
them.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
play, 1
at, 1
gaining, 1
or, 1
losing, 1
300,000, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
a, 1
day;, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
enormously, 1
rich.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
he, 1
who, 1
plays!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Lucien;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars:, 1
she, 1
is, 1
indeed, 1
daring.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
who, 1
are, 1
a, 1
reasonable, 1
being,, 1
Lucien,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
how, 1
little, 1
dependence, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
news,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
are, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fountain-head,, 1
surely, 1
you, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I,, 1
if, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
fails, 1
in, 1
controlling, 1
her?", 1
asked, 1
Lucien;, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
character, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness--no, 1
one, 1
has, 1
any, 1
influence, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
does, 1
precisely, 1
what, 1
she, 1
pleases.", 1
"Ah,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
in, 1
your, 1
place"--said, 1
Albert., 1
"Well?", 1
"I, 1
would, 1
reform, 1
her;, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
rendering, 1
a, 1
service, 1
to, 1
her, 1
future, 1
son-in-law.", 1
"How, 1
would, 1
you, 1
set, 1
about, 1
it?", 1
"Ah,, 1
that, 1
would, 1
be, 1
easy, 1
enough--I, 1
would, 1
give, 1
her, 1
a, 1
lesson.", 1
"A, 1
lesson?", 1
"Yes., 1
Your, 1
position, 1
as, 1
secretary, 1
to, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
renders, 1
your, 1
authority, 1
great, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
political, 1
news;, 1
you, 1
never, 1
open, 1
your, 1
mouth, 1
but, 1
the, 1
stockbrokers, 1
immediately, 1
stenograph, 1
your, 1
words., 1
Cause, 1
her, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
would, 1
teach, 1
her, 1
prudence.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand,", 1
stammered, 1
Lucien., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
clear,, 1
notwithstanding,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
artlessness, 1
wholly, 1
free, 1
from, 1
affectation;, 1
"tell, 1
her, 1
some, 1
fine, 1
morning, 1
an, 1
unheard-of, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
intelligence--some, 1
telegraphic, 1
despatch,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
alone, 1
are, 1
in, 1
possession;, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
that, 1
Henri, 1
IV., 1
was, 1
seen, 1
yesterday, 1
at, 1
Gabrielle's., 1
That, 1
would, 1
boom, 1
the, 1
market;, 1
she, 1
will, 1
buy, 1
heavily,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
will, 1
certainly, 1
lose, 1
when, 1
Beauchamp, 1
announces, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
gazette,, 1
'The, 1
report, 1
circulated, 1
by, 1
some, 1
usually, 1
well-informed, 1
persons, 1
that, 1
the, 1
king, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
yesterday, 1
at, 1
Gabrielle's, 1
house,, 1
is, 1
totally, 1
without, 1
foundation., 1
We, 1
can, 1
positively, 1
assert, 1
that, 1
his, 1
majesty, 1
did, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
Pont-Neuf.'", 1
Lucien, 1
half, 1
smiled., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
although, 1
apparently, 1
indifferent,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
lost, 1
one, 1
word, 1
of, 1
this, 1
conversation,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
penetrating, 1
eye, 1
had, 1
even, 1
read, 1
a, 1
hidden, 1
secret, 1
in, 1
the, 1
embarrassed, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
secretary., 1
This, 1
embarrassment, 1
had, 1
completely, 1
escaped, 1
Albert,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
caused, 1
Lucien, 1
to, 1
shorten, 1
his, 1
visit;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
ill, 1
at, 1
ease., 1
The, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
taking, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
said, 1
something, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
answered,, 1
"Willingly,, 1
count;, 1
I, 1
accept.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
young, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
think,, 1
on, 1
reflection,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
wrong, 1
in, 1
thus, 1
speaking, 1
of, 1
your, 1
mother-in-law, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Debray?", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
apply, 1
that, 1
title, 1
so, 1
prematurely.", 1
"Now,, 1
speaking, 1
without, 1
any, 1
exaggeration,, 1
is, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
really, 1
so, 1
very, 1
much, 1
averse, 1
to, 1
this, 1
marriage?", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
very, 1
rarely, 1
comes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
has, 1
not,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
visited, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
twice, 1
in, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
life.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
emboldened, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
openly, 1
to, 1
you., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
my, 1
banker;, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
has, 1
overwhelmed, 1
me, 1
with, 1
politeness, 1
in, 1
return, 1
for, 1
a, 1
service, 1
which, 1
a, 1
casual, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
enabled, 1
me, 1
to, 1
render, 1
him., 1
I, 1
predict, 1
from, 1
all, 1
this, 1
an, 1
avalanche, 1
of, 1
dinners, 1
and, 1
routs., 1
Now,, 1

to, 1
presume, 1
on, 1
this,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
to, 1
be, 1
beforehand, 1
with, 1
them,, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
if, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
inviting, 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
to, 1
my, 1
country-house, 1
at, 1
Auteuil., 1
If, 1
I, 1
were, 1
to, 1
invite, 1
you, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
and, 1
Countess, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
to, 1
this, 1
dinner,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
give, 1
it, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
being, 1
a, 1
matrimonial, 1
meeting,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
would, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
in, 1
that, 1
light,, 1
especially, 1
if, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars, 1
did, 1
me, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
his, 1
daughter., 1
In, 1
that, 1
case, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
would, 1
hold, 1
me, 1
in, 1
aversion,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
at, 1
all, 1
wish, 1
that;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
high, 1
in, 1
her, 1
esteem.", 1
"Indeed,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
sincerely, 1
for, 1
having, 1
used, 1
so, 1
much, 1
candor, 1
towards, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
gratefully, 1
accept, 1
the, 1
exclusion, 1
which, 1
you, 1
propose., 1
You, 1
say, 1
you, 1
desire, 1
my, 1
mother's, 1
good, 1
opinion;, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
it, 1
is, 1
already, 1
yours, 1
to, 1
a, 1
very, 1
unusual, 1
extent.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
interest., 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
we, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
you, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
after, 1
you, 1
left, 1
us, 1
the, 1
other, 1
day., 1
But, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
what, 1
we, 1
were, 1
saying., 1
If, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
could, 1
know, 1
of, 1
this, 1
attention, 1
on, 1
your, 1
part--and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
venture, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
her--I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
she, 1
will, 1
be, 1
most, 1
grateful, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true, 1
that, 1
my, 1
father, 1
will, 1
be, 1
equally, 1
angry.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
laughed., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
think, 1
your, 1
father, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
the, 1
only, 1
angry, 1
one;, 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
will, 1
think, 1
me, 1
a, 1
very, 1
ill-mannered, 1
person., 1
They, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
intimate, 1
with, 1
you--that, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
in, 1
fact;, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oldest, 1
of, 1
my, 1
Parisian, 1
acquaintances--and, 1
they, 1
will, 1
not, 1
find, 1
you, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house;, 1
they, 1
will, 1
certainly, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
why, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
invite, 1
you., 1
Be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
provide, 1
yourself, 1
with, 1
some, 1
previous, 1
engagement, 1
which, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
a, 1
semblance, 1
of, 1
probability,, 1
and, 1
communicate, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
to, 1
me, 1
by, 1
a, 1
line, 1
in, 1
writing., 1
You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
with, 1
bankers, 1
nothing, 1

a, 1
written, 1
document, 1
will, 1
be, 1
valid.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1

Albert;, 1

are!, 1

you, 1
forgotten, 1

true.", 1
"Fix, 1
it, 1
this, 1
way., 1

have, 1
seen, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
invited, 1
you, 1
without, 1
any, 1
ceremony,, 1

you, 1

answered, 1

be, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
you, 1

a, 1
difficult, 1
matter, 1

can, 1

Major, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
Both, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Baptistin, 1
had, 1
told, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
when, 1
they, 1
announced, 1
to, 1
Morcerf, 1
the, 1
proposed, 1
visit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
served, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
as, 1
a, 1
pretext, 1
for, 1
declining, 1
Albert's, 1
invitation., 1
Seven, 1
o'clock, 1
had, 1
just, 1
struck,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
command, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
given, 1
him,, 1
had, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
before, 1
left, 1
for, 1
Auteuil,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
cab, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
depositing, 1
its, 1
occupant, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
immediately, 1
hurried, 1
away,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
ashamed, 1
of, 1
its, 1
employment., 1
The, 1
visitor, 1
was, 1
about, 1
fifty-two, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
green, 1
surtouts,, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
black, 1
frogs,, 1
which, 1
have, 1
so, 1
long, 1
maintained, 1
their, 1
popularity, 1
all, 1
over, 1
Europe., 1
He, 1
wore, 1
trousers, 1
of, 1
blue, 1
cloth,, 1
boots, 1
tolerably, 1
clean,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brightest, 1
polish,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
little, 1
too, 1
thick, 1
in, 1
the, 1
soles,, 1
buckskin, 1
gloves,, 1
a, 1
hat, 1
somewhat, 1
resembling, 1
in, 1
shape, 1
those, 1
usually, 1
worn, 1
by, 1
the, 1
gendarmes,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
black, 1
cravat, 1
striped, 1
with, 1
white,, 1
which,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
proprietor, 1
had, 1
not, 1
worn, 1
it, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
free, 1
will,, 1
might, 1
have, 1
passed, 1
for, 1
a, 1
halter,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
did, 1
it, 1
resemble, 1
one., 1
Such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
picturesque, 1
costume, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
rang, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
and, 1
demanded, 1

it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
at, 1

in, 1
the, 1

lived,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
being, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative,, 1
entered,, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
ascend, 1
the, 1
steps., 1
The, 1
small, 1
and, 1
angular, 1
head, 1
of, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
his, 1
white, 1
hair, 1
and, 1
thick, 1
gray, 1
mustaches,, 1
caused, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
recognized, 1
by, 1
Baptistin,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
received, 1
an, 1
exact, 1
description, 1
of, 1
the, 1
expected, 1
visitor,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
was, 1
awaiting, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hall., 1
Therefore,, 1
scarcely, 1
had, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
time, 1
to, 1
pronounce, 1
his, 1
name, 1
before, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
apprised, 1
of, 1
his, 1
arrival., 1
He, 1
was, 1
ushered, 1
into, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
and, 1
elegant, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smiling, 1
air., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
most, 1
welcome;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
expecting, 1
you.", 1
"Indeed,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Italian,, 1
"was, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
then, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
my, 1
visit?", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
told, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
see, 1
you, 1
to-day, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
have, 1
received, 1
full, 1
information, 1
concerning, 1
my, 1
arrival?", 1
"Of, 1
course.", 1
"Ah,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
I, 1
feared, 1
this, 1
little, 1
precaution, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
forgotten.", 1
"What, 1
precaution?", 1
"That, 1
of, 1
informing, 1
you, 1
beforehand, 1
of, 1
my, 1
coming.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
it, 1
has, 1
not.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
are, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
mistaken.", 1
"Very, 1
sure.", 1
"It, 1
really, 1
was, 1
I, 1
whom, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
expected, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
this, 1
evening?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
prove, 1
it, 1
to, 1
you, 1
beyond, 1
a, 1
doubt.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
never, 1
mind, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Italian;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
worth, 1
the, 1
trouble.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
His, 1
visitor, 1
appeared, 1
slightly, 1
uneasy., 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Marquis, 1
Bartolomeo, 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
"Bartolomeo, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
joyfully, 1
replied, 1
the, 1
Italian;, 1
"yes,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
really, 1
he.", 1
"Ex-major, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Austrian, 1
service?", 1
"Was, 1
I, 1
a, 1
major?", 1
timidly, 1
asked, 1
the, 1
old, 1
soldier., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
major;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
title, 1

French, 1

to, 1
the, 1
post, 1
which, 1
you, 1
filled, 1
in, 1
Italy.", 1
"Very, 1
good,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
demand, 1
more,, 1
you, 1
understand"--, 1
"Your, 1
visit, 1
here, 1
to-day, 1
is, 1
not, 1
of, 1
your, 1
own, 1
suggestion,, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"No,, 1
certainly, 1
not.", 1
"You, 1
were, 1
sent, 1
by, 1
some, 1
other, 1
person?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"By, 1
the, 1
excellent, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni?", 1
"Exactly, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
delighted, 1
major., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
have, 1
a, 1
letter?", 1
"Yes,, 1
there, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"Give, 1
it, 1
me,, 1
then;", 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
read., 1
The, 1
major, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
his, 1
large, 1
staring, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
took, 1
a, 1
survey, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
gaze, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
reverted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
proprietor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
see., 1

Cristo,, 1
reading, 1
aloud,, 1
"'possessing, 1
an, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
from, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
bowed., 1
"Half, 1
a, 1
million,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"magnificent!", 1
"Half, 1
a, 1
million,, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major., 1
"Yes,, 1

it, 1
must, 1

on, 1
my, 1

honor,, 1

had, 1
no, 1
idea, 1
that, 1

"Because, 1
you, 1
are, 1

"You, 1
have, 1
opened, 1
my, 1

said, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
gravely;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
show, 1
the, 1
gentlemen, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
perusal, 1
of, 1
the, 1
letter:--, 1
"'And, 1

"Yes,, 1
indeed, 1
but, 1
one!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh., 1
"'Which, 1
is, 1
to, 1

"At, 1

said, 1
the, 1

with, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
sigh,, 1
and, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
"Unhappy, 1

said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1

count, 1
continued:--, 1

at, 1

an, 1
indescribable, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
anxiety., 1
"I, 1

recovered, 1
his, 1

"So,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"the, 1

was, 1
true, 1

drops, 1
of, 1

made, 1
a, 1

he, 1
took, 1
the, 1
full, 1
glass, 1

Alicante, 1
with, 1
an, 1

satisfaction,, 1

then, 1
delicately, 1
steeped, 1
his, 1

in, 1
the, 1

"So,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
lived, 1
at, 1

you?, 1

his, 1
biscuit,, 1
"positively, 1
all.", 1

raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1

sighed., 1
"Let, 1
me, 1

then,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1
"who, 1

recovered, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
calm, 1
manner,, 1
at, 1
the, 1

down,, 1

on, 1
whose, 1

still, 1
announced, 1
the, 1

polite, 1
curiosity., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1

"I, 1
did, 1

"Oh,, 1
no,, 1

the, 1

with, 1
a, 1

of, 1
the, 1
head., 1
"But, 1
for, 1

of, 1

"Yes,, 1
for, 1

mother's, 1
sake--his, 1
poor, 1
mother!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
third, 1
biscuit., 1
"Take, 1
some, 1
more, 1
wine,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1

pouring, 1
out, 1
for, 1
him, 1
a, 1

glass, 1
of, 1
Alicante;, 1
"your, 1
emotion, 1
has, 1
quite, 1
overcome, 1
you.", 1
"His, 1
poor, 1

the, 1
major,, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
get, 1
the, 1
lachrymal, 1
gland, 1
in, 1
operation,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
moisten, 1
the, 1
corner, 1

a, 1
false, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1

for, 1
his, 1
education, 1
to, 1
a, 1
college, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
provinces,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
him, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
his, 1
education, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
world., 1
That, 1
is, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
which, 1
has, 1
induced, 1
you, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
Via, 1

where, 1
you, 1
have, 1
lived, 1
since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
your, 1

will, 1
be, 1
sufficient.", 1
"You, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
then.", 1
"If, 1
they, 1
should, 1
hear, 1
of, 1
the, 1
separation"--, 1
"Ah,, 1
yes;, 1
what, 1
could, 1
I, 1
say?", 1
"That, 1
an, 1
unfaithful, 1
tutor,, 1
bought, 1
over, 1
by, 1
the, 1
enemies, 1
of, 1
your, 1

the, 1
Corsinari?", 1

away, 1
this, 1
child,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
your, 1

an, 1
only, 1
son.", 1

not, 1

You, 1
have,, 1
doubtless,, 1
already, 1

was, 1
preparing, 1
a, 1
surprise, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
"An, 1
agreeable, 1
one?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
Italian., 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
is, 1
no, 1
more, 1
to, 1

said, 1
the, 1
major., 1
"Some, 1
one, 1
has, 1
told, 1
you, 1
the, 1
secret;, 1

perhaps,, 1
you, 1
guessed, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
here.", 1
"That, 1
who, 1
was, 1
here?", 1
"Your, 1
child--your, 1
son--your, 1
Andrea!", 1

did, 1
guess, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
major, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
possible, 1
coolness., 1
"Then, 1
he, 1
is, 1
here?", 1
"He, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"when, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
came, 1
in, 1
just, 1

of, 1

coat, 1
at, 1
each, 1
exclamation., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
sir,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
your, 1
emotion;, 1
you, 1
must, 1

time, 1
to, 1

will,, 1
in, 1

go, 1

man, 1
for, 1

yourself.", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
quite, 1
imagine, 1
that, 1
to, 1

the, 1
case,", 1

Cavalcanti., 1
"Well,, 1

a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1

shall, 1
be, 1
with, 1
you.", 1

will, 1

him,, 1

of, 1
fair, 1

little, 1
too, 1
fair,, 1

in, 1
manners;, 1

you, 1
will, 1
see, 1

judge, 1
for, 1

way,", 1

the, 1

sparkled, 1
brilliantly., 1

is, 1
40,000, 1
francs, 1

I, 1
now, 1
owe, 1
you,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Does, 1

"For, 1
what?", 1

the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1

it, 1
to, 1

Between, 1
honest, 1
men, 1
such, 1
excessive, 1
precaution, 1
is,, 1
I, 1

unnecessary.", 1
"Yes,, 1
so, 1
it, 1
is,, 1
between, 1
perfectly, 1
upright, 1
people.", 1
"One, 1
word, 1
more,", 1

Cristo., 1

on.", 1

me, 1
to, 1

complete, 1
satisfaction., 1
"Yes., 1

may, 1
be, 1
worn, 1
at, 1

that, 1
costume,, 1

elegant, 1
in, 1
itself,, 1
has, 1
long, 1
been, 1
out, 1
of, 1
fashion, 1

unfortunate.", 1
"Oh,, 1

you, 1
really, 1
are, 1
attached, 1

with, 1

little, 1
baggage, 1

so.", 1

well,, 1
very, 1
well,", 1

was, 1
in, 1
ecstasy, 1
at, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
paid, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count., 1

Cristo,, 1

disappeared, 1
behind, 1

fascinated, 1
beyond, 1
expression, 1
with, 1
the, 1
delightful, 1
reception, 1
which, 1

had, 1
received, 1
at, 1

hands, 1
of, 1

count., 1
Chapter, 1
56., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room,, 1
which, 1
Baptistin, 1
had, 1
designated, 1
as, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
there, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
of, 1
graceful, 1
demeanor, 1
and, 1
elegant, 1
appearance,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cab, 1
about, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
previously., 1
Baptistin, 1
had, 1
not, 1
found, 1
any, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
recognizing, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
for, 1
admittance., 1
He, 1
was, 1
certainly, 1
the, 1
tall, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
light, 1
hair,, 1
red, 1
beard,, 1
black, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
brilliant, 1
complexion,, 1
whom, 1
his, 1
master, 1
had, 1
so, 1
particularly, 1
described, 1
to, 1
him., 1
When, 1
the, 1
count, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
carelessly, 1
stretched, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sofa,, 1
tapping, 1
his, 1
boot, 1
with, 1
the, 1
gold-headed, 1
cane, 1
which, 1
he, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
On, 1
perceiving, 1
the, 1
count, 1
he, 1
rose, 1
quickly., 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
I, 1
believe?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1

I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
addressing, 1
Count, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
"Count, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
accompanying, 1
his, 1
words, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bow., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
charged, 1
with, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
introduction, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
mention, 1
that,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
signature, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
me, 1
so, 1
strange.", 1
"The, 1
letter, 1
signed, 1
'Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor,', 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Exactly, 1
so., 1
Now,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
known, 1
any, 1
Sinbad,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
the, 1
one, 1
celebrated, 1
in, 1
the, 1
'Thousand, 1
and, 1
One, 1
Nights'"--, 1
"Well,, 1

of, 1
his, 1
descendants,, 1

a, 1
great, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine;, 1

a, 1
very, 1
rich, 1
Englishman,, 1
eccentric, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
insanity,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
real, 1
name, 1
is, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?, 1
Then, 1
that, 1
explains, 1
everything, 1
that, 1
is, 1
extraordinary,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"He, 1
is,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
same, 1
Englishman, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
met--at--ah--yes,, 1
indeed., 1
Well,, 1
monsieur,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service.", 1
"If, 1
what, 1
you, 1
say, 1
be, 1
true,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
smiling,, 1
"perhaps, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
kind, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
some, 1
account, 1
of, 1
yourself, 1
and, 1
your, 1
family?", 1
"Certainly,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
quickness, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
his, 1
ready, 1
invention., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
(as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
said), 1

Cavalcanti, 1
whose, 1
names, 1
are, 1
inscribed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
golden, 1
book, 1
at, 1
Florence., 1
Our, 1
family,, 1
although, 1
still, 1
rich, 1
(for, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
income, 1
amounts, 1
to, 1
half, 1
a, 1
million),, 1
has, 1
experienced, 1
many, 1
misfortunes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
myself, 1
was,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
age, 1
of, 1
five, 1
years,, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
by, 1
the, 1
treachery, 1
of, 1
my, 1
tutor,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
for, 1
fifteen, 1
years, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
author, 1
of, 1
my, 1
existence., 1
Since, 1
I, 1
have, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
years, 1
of, 1
discretion, 1
and, 1
become, 1
my, 1
own, 1
master,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
constantly, 1
seeking, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
all, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
At, 1
length, 1
I, 1
received, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
your, 1
friend,, 1
which, 1
states, 1
that, 1
my, 1

respecting, 1
him.", 1
"Really,, 1
all, 1
you, 1
have, 1
related, 1
to, 1
me, 1
is, 1
exceedingly, 1
interesting,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
observing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
satisfaction;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
well, 1
to, 1
conform, 1
in, 1
everything, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
Sinbad;, 1
for, 1
your, 1
father, 1

indeed, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
seeking, 1
you.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
from, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
first, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
once, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
countenance;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
admired, 1
the, 1
assurance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
look, 1
and, 1
the, 1
firmness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
voice;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
so, 1
natural, 1
in, 1
themselves,, 1
"Your, 1
father, 1
is, 1
indeed, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
seeking, 1
you,", 1
young, 1
Andrea, 1
started,, 1
and, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"My, 1
father?, 1
Is, 1
my, 1
father, 1
here?", 1
"Most, 1
undoubtedly,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"your, 1
father,, 1
Major, 1
Bartolomeo, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
The, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
terror, 1
which,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
had, 1
overspread, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
had, 1
now, 1
disappeared., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
name,, 1
certainly., 1
Major, 1
Bartolomeo, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
And, 1
you, 1
really, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say;, 1
monsieur,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father, 1
is, 1
here?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
can, 1
even, 1
add, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
only, 1
just, 1
left, 1
his, 1
company., 1
The, 1
history, 1
which, 1
he, 1
related, 1
to, 1
me, 1
of, 1
his, 1
lost, 1
son, 1
touched, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
quick;, 1
indeed,, 1
his, 1
griefs,, 1
hopes,, 1
and, 1
fears, 1
on, 1
that, 1
subject, 1
might, 1
furnish, 1
material, 1
for, 1
a, 1
most, 1
touching, 1
and, 1
pathetic, 1
poem., 1
At, 1
length,, 1
he, 1
one, 1
day, 1
received, 1
a, 1
letter,, 1
stating, 1
that, 1
the, 1
abductors, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son, 1
now, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
to, 1
give, 1
notice, 1
where, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
found,, 1
on, 1
condition, 1
of, 1
receiving, 1
a, 1
large, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
money,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
ransom., 1
Your, 1
father, 1
did, 1
not, 1
hesitate, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
was, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
the, 1
frontier, 1
of, 1
Piedmont,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
passport, 1
signed, 1
for, 1
Italy., 1
You, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
south, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
embarrassed, 1
air,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
south, 1
of, 1
France.", 1
"A, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
to, 1
await, 1
you, 1
at, 1
Nice?", 1
"Precisely, 1
so;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
conveyed, 1
me, 1
from, 1
Nice, 1
to, 1
Genoa,, 1
from, 1
Genoa, 1
to, 1
Turin,, 1
from, 1
Turin, 1
to, 1
Chambery,, 1
from, 1
Chambery, 1
to, 1
Pont-de-Beauvoisin,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
Pont-de-Beauvoisin, 1
to, 1
Paris.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
Then, 1
your, 1
father, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
met, 1
with, 1
you, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
is, 1
exactly, 1
the, 1
same, 1
route, 1
which, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
took,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
how, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
trace, 1
your, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
this, 1
place.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"if, 1
my, 1
father, 1
had, 1
met, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
if, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
recognized, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
somewhat, 1
altered, 1
since, 1
he, 1
last, 1
saw, 1
me.", 1
"Oh,, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
nature,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"True,", 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
in, 1
that, 1
light.", 1
"Now,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
only, 1
one, 1
source, 1
of, 1
uneasiness, 1
left, 1
in, 1
your, 1
father's, 1
mind,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
this--he, 1
is, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
know, 1
how, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
employed, 1
during, 1
your, 1
long, 1
absence, 1
from, 1
him,, 1
how, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
treated, 1
by, 1
your, 1
persecutors,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
they, 1
have, 1
conducted, 1
themselves, 1
towards, 1
you, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
deference, 1
due, 1
to, 1
your, 1
rank., 1
Finally,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
fortunate, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
bad, 1
moral, 1
influence, 1
to, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
exposed,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
is, 1
infinitely, 1
more, 1
to, 1
be, 1
dreaded, 1
than, 1
any, 1
physical, 1
suffering;, 1
he, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
if, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
abilities, 1
with, 1
which, 1
nature, 1
had, 1
endowed, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
weakened, 1
by, 1
want, 1
of, 1
culture;, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
short,, 1
whether, 1
you, 1
consider, 1
yourself, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
resuming, 1
and, 1
retaining, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
the, 1
high, 1
position, 1
to, 1
which, 1
your, 1
rank, 1
entitles, 1
you.", 1
"Sir!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
quite, 1
astounded,, 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
no, 1
false, 1
report"--, 1
"As, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
I, 1
first, 1
heard, 1
you, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
by, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
Wilmore,, 1
the, 1
philanthropist., 1
I, 1
believe, 1
he, 1
found, 1
you, 1
in, 1
some, 1
unpleasant, 1
position,, 1
but, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
of, 1
what, 1
nature,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
ask,, 1
not, 1
being, 1
inquisitive., 1
Your, 1
misfortunes, 1
engaged, 1
his, 1
sympathies,, 1
so, 1
you, 1
see, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
interesting., 1
He, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
position, 1
which, 1
you, 1
had, 1
lost,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
seek, 1
your, 1
father, 1
until, 1
he, 1
found, 1
him., 1
He, 1
did, 1
seek,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
found, 1
him,, 1
apparently,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
is, 1
here, 1
now;, 1
and,, 1
finally,, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
apprised, 1
me, 1
of, 1
your, 1
coming,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
few, 1
other, 1
instructions, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
your, 1
future, 1
fortune., 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
Wilmore, 1
is, 1
peculiar,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
is, 1
sincere,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
rich, 1
as, 1
a, 1
gold-mine,, 1
consequently,, 1
he, 1
may, 1
indulge, 1
his, 1
eccentricities, 1
without, 1
any, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
their, 1
ruining, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
adhere, 1
to, 1
his, 1
instructions., 1
Now,, 1
sir,, 1
pray, 1
do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
offended, 1
at, 1
the, 1
question, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
put, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
comes, 1
in, 1
the, 1
way, 1
of, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
as, 1
your, 1
patron., 1

have, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
you--misfortunes, 1
entirely, 1
beyond, 1
your, 1
control,, 1

which, 1
in, 1
no, 1
degree, 1
diminish, 1
my, 1
regard, 1
for, 1
you--I, 1
would, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know, 1
if, 1
they, 1
have, 1
not,, 1
in, 1
some, 1
measure,, 1
contributed, 1
to, 1
render, 1
you, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
the, 1
world, 1
in, 1
which, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
and, 1
your, 1
name, 1
entitle, 1
you, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
conspicuous, 1
figure?", 1
"Sir,", 1
returned, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
reassurance, 1
of, 1
manner,, 1
"make, 1
your, 1

who, 1
took, 1
me, 1
from, 1
my, 1
father,, 1

who, 1
always, 1
intended,, 1
sooner, 1
or, 1
later,, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
me, 1
again, 1
to, 1
my, 1
original, 1
proprietor,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
have, 1
now, 1
done,, 1
calculated, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
most, 1
of, 1

would, 1
be, 1
politic, 1

me, 1

personal, 1
and, 1
hereditary, 1
worth,, 1

even, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
the, 1
value,, 1
if, 1
possible., 1
I, 1
have,, 1
therefore,, 1
received, 1
a, 1
very, 1
good, 1
education,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
been, 1
treated, 1
by, 1
these, 1
kidnappers, 1
very, 1
much, 1
as, 1
the, 1
slaves, 1
were, 1
treated, 1
in, 1
Asia, 1
Minor,, 1
whose, 1
masters, 1
made, 1
them, 1
grammarians,, 1
doctors,, 1
and, 1
philosophers,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
fetch, 1
a, 1
higher, 1
price, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
market.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
smiled, 1
with, 1
satisfaction;, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
expected, 1
so, 1
much, 1
from, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
"Besides,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"if, 1
there, 1
did, 1
appear, 1
some, 1
defect, 1
in, 1
education,, 1
or, 1
offence, 1
against, 1
the, 1
established, 1
forms, 1
of, 1
etiquette,, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
excused,, 1

"Well,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
an, 1
indifferent, 1
tone,, 1

will, 1
do, 1

are, 1
the, 1
person, 1
most, 1
concerned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
but, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
divulge, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
these, 1
adventures., 1
Your, 1
history, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
romance,, 1

world,, 1
which, 1
delights, 1

romances, 1
in, 1

strangely, 1

are, 1
bound, 1
in, 1
living, 1
parchment,, 1
even, 1
though, 1
they, 1

gilded, 1

This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
difficulty, 1
which, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
represent, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count., 1
You, 1
would, 1
hardly, 1
have, 1
recited, 1
your, 1
touching, 1
history, 1
before, 1
it, 1
would, 1
go, 1
forth, 1
to, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
deemed, 1
unlikely, 1
and, 1
unnatural., 1
You, 1
would, 1
be, 1
no, 1
longer, 1

lost, 1
child, 1
found,, 1

you, 1
would, 1
be, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
an, 1
upstart,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
sprung, 1
up, 1
like, 1
a, 1
mushroom, 1
in, 1
the, 1
night., 1
You, 1
might, 1
excite, 1
a, 1
little, 1
curiosity,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
every, 1
one, 1

of, 1
unpleasant, 1
remark.", 1

the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
turning, 1
pale,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
himself,, 1
trembling, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
scrutinizing, 1
look, 1
of, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
"such, 1
consequences, 1
would, 1
be, 1
extremely, 1
unpleasant.", 1
"Nevertheless,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
exaggerate, 1
the, 1
evil,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"for, 1
by, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
one, 1

another., 1

of, 1

Andrea, 1
visibly, 1
changed, 1
countenance., 1
"I, 1
would, 1
offer, 1
myself, 1
as, 1
your, 1
surety, 1

friendly, 1
adviser,", 1

out, 1
of, 1

should,, 1
therefore,, 1
run, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1

would, 1
be, 1
an, 1
act, 1
of, 1
folly.", 1
"However,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"in, 1
consideration, 1
of, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
was, 1

to, 1
you--", 1
"Yes,, 1
certainly,", 1
interrupted, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"but, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
did, 1
not, 1
omit, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Andrea,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
season, 1
of, 1
your, 1
youth, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
stormy, 1
one., 1
Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
watching, 1
Andrea's, 1
countenance,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
demand, 1
any, 1
confession, 1
from, 1
you;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
precisely, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
that, 1
necessity, 1
that, 1
your, 1
father, 1
was, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
from, 1
Lucca., 1
You, 1
shall, 1
soon, 1
see, 1
him., 1
He, 1
is, 1
a, 1
little, 1
stiff, 1
and, 1
pompous, 1
in, 1
his, 1
manner,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
is, 1
disfigured, 1
by, 1
his, 1
uniform;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
it, 1
becomes, 1
known, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
for, 1
eighteen, 1
years, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Austrian, 1
service,, 1
all, 1
that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
pardoned., 1
We, 1
are, 1
not, 1
generally, 1
very, 1
severe, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Austrians., 1
In, 1
short,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
your, 1
father, 1
a, 1
very, 1
presentable, 1
person,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you.", 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
given, 1
me, 1
confidence;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
so, 1
long, 1
since, 1
we, 1
were, 1
separated,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
the, 1
least, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
and,, 1
besides,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world, 1
a, 1
large, 1
fortune, 1
covers, 1
all, 1
defects.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
a, 1
millionaire--his, 1
income, 1
is, 1
500,000, 1
francs.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
anxiety,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
be, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
an, 1
agreeable, 1
position.", 1
"One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
agreeable, 1
possible,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir;, 1
he, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
you, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
50,000, 1
livres, 1
per, 1
annum, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
time, 1
of, 1
your, 1
stay, 1
in, 1
Paris.", 1
"Then, 1
in, 1
that, 1
case, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
always, 1
choose, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
there.", 1
"You, 1
cannot, 1
control, 1
circumstances,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir;, 1
'man, 1
proposes,, 1
and, 1
God, 1
disposes.'", 1
Andrea, 1
sighed., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
forces, 1
me, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
it,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
receiving, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
you, 1
just, 1
now, 1

to, 1
me?", 1
"You, 1
may.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
receive, 1
it, 1
from, 1
my, 1
father?", 1
asked, 1
Andrea,, 1
with, 1
some, 1
uneasiness., 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
receive, 1
it, 1
from, 1
your, 1
father, 1
personally,, 1
but, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
security, 1
for, 1
the, 1
money., 1
He, 1
has,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
request, 1
of, 1
your, 1
father,, 1
opened, 1
an, 1
account, 1
of, 1
6,000., 1
francs, 1
a, 1
month, 1
at, 1
M., 1
Danglars',, 1
which, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
safest, 1
banks, 1
in, 1
Paris.", 1
"And, 1
does, 1
my, 1
father, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
long, 1
in, 1
Paris?", 1
asked, 1
Andrea., 1
"Only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"His, 1
service, 1
does, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
him, 1
to, 1
absent, 1
himself, 1
more, 1
than, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
together.", 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Andrea,, 1
evidently, 1
charmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
his, 1
speedy, 1
departure., 1
"Therefore,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
feigning, 1
to, 1
mistake, 1
his, 1
meaning--"therefore, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not,, 1
for, 1
another, 1
instant,, 1
retard, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
your, 1
meeting., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
embrace, 1
your, 1
worthy, 1
father?", 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
doubt, 1
it.", 1
"Go,, 1
then,, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
my, 1
young, 1
friend,, 1
where, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
your, 1
father, 1
awaiting, 1
you.", 1
Andrea, 1
made, 1
a, 1
low, 1
bow, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
till, 1
he, 1
disappeared,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
touched, 1
a, 1
spring, 1
in, 1
a, 1
panel, 1
made, 1
to, 1
look, 1
like, 1
a, 1
picture,, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
sliding, 1
partly, 1
from, 1
the, 1
frame,, 1
discovered, 1
to, 1
view, 1
a, 1
small, 1
opening,, 1
so, 1
cleverly, 1
contrived, 1
that, 1
it, 1
revealed, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
now, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
and, 1
Andrea., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
risen, 1
when, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
steps, 1
approaching, 1
him., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father!", 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
in, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
voice,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
might, 1
hear, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
next, 1
room,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
really, 1
you?", 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
son?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major, 1
gravely., 1
"After, 1
so, 1
many, 1
years, 1
of, 1
painful, 1
separation,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
glancing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
"what, 1
a, 1
happiness, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
again!", 1
"Indeed, 1
it, 1
is,, 1
after, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
separation.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
not, 1
embrace, 1
me,, 1
sir?", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"If, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
son,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men, 1
embraced, 1
each, 1
other, 1
after, 1
the, 1
fashion, 1
of, 1
actors, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stage;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
each, 1
rested, 1
his, 1
head, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other's, 1
shoulder., 1
"Then, 1
we, 1
are, 1
once, 1
more, 1
reunited?", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"Once, 1
more,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
major., 1
"Never, 1
more, 1
to, 1
be, 1
separated?", 1
"Why,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
that--I, 1
think,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
son,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
be, 1
by, 1
this, 1
time, 1
so, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
France, 1
as, 1
to, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
a, 1
second, 1
country.", 1
"The, 1
fact, 1
is,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
exceedingly, 1
grieved, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
it.", 1
"As, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
know, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
possibly, 1
live, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Lucca;, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Italy, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
I, 1
can.", 1
"But, 1
before, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
France,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
put, 1
me, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
the, 1
documents, 1
which, 1
will, 1
be, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
my, 1
descent.", 1
"Certainly;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
come, 1
expressly, 1
on, 1
that, 1
account;, 1
it, 1
has, 1
cost, 1
me, 1
much, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
find, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
had, 1
resolved, 1
on, 1
giving, 1
them, 1
into, 1
your, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
to, 1
recommence, 1
my, 1
search,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
occupy, 1
all, 1
the, 1
few, 1
remaining, 1
years, 1
of, 1
my, 1
life.", 1
"Where, 1
are, 1
these, 1
papers,, 1
then?", 1
"Here, 1
they, 1
are.", 1
Andrea, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
certificate, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
marriage, 1
and, 1
his, 1
own, 1
baptismal, 1
register,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
opened, 1
them, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
eagerness, 1
which, 1
might, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
under, 1
the, 1
circumstances,, 1
he, 1
read, 1
them, 1
with, 1
a, 1
facility, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
similar, 1
documents,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
plainly, 1
denoted, 1
an, 1
unusual, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
the, 1
contents., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
perused, 1
the, 1
documents,, 1
an, 1
indefinable, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
pleasure, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
his, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
major, 1
with, 1
a, 1
most, 1
peculiar, 1
smile,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
very, 1
excellent, 1
Tuscan,--"Then, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
such, 1
thing,, 1
in, 1
Italy, 1
as, 1
being, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
galleys?", 1
The, 1
major, 1
drew, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
to, 1
his, 1
full, 1
height., 1
"Why?--what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
that, 1
question?", 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
if, 1
there, 1
were,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
up, 1
with, 1
impunity, 1
two, 1
such, 1
deeds, 1
as, 1
these., 1
In, 1
France,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
half, 1
such, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
effrontery, 1
as, 1
that, 1
would, 1
cause, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
quickly, 1
despatched, 1
to, 1
Toulon, 1
for, 1
five, 1
years,, 1
for, 1
change, 1
of, 1
air.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
be, 1
good, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
your, 1
meaning?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
endeavoring, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
majesty., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
major, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
in, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
manner,, 1
"how, 1
much, 1
are, 1
you, 1
paid, 1
for, 1
being, 1
my, 1
father?", 1
The, 1
major, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
when, 1
Andrea, 1
continued,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice., 1
"Nonsense,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
set, 1
you, 1
an, 1
example, 1
of, 1
confidence,, 1
they, 1
give, 1
me, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
year, 1
to, 1
be, 1
your, 1
son;, 1
consequently,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
at, 1
all, 1
likely, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
ever, 1
deny, 1
my, 1
parent.", 1
The, 1
major, 1
looked, 1
anxiously, 1
around, 1
him., 1
"Make, 1
yourself, 1
easy,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
quite, 1
alone,", 1
said, 1
Andrea;, 1
"besides,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
conversing, 1
in, 1
Italian.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
"they, 1
paid, 1
me, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
down.", 1
"Monsieur, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
fairy, 1
tales?", 1
"I, 1
used, 1
not, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
really, 1
feel, 1
now, 1
almost, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
have, 1
faith, 1
in, 1
them.", 1
"You, 1
have,, 1
then,, 1
been, 1
induced, 1
to, 1
alter, 1
your, 1
opinion;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
had, 1
some, 1
proofs, 1
of, 1
their, 1
truth?", 1
The, 1
major, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
handful, 1
of, 1
gold., 1
"Most, 1
palpable, 1
proofs,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
perceive.", 1
"You, 1
think,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
rely, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
promises?", 1
"Certainly, 1
I, 1
do.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
sure, 1
he, 1
will, 1
keep, 1
his, 1
word, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1

at, 1
the, 1

time,, 1
remember,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
continue, 1
to, 1
play, 1
our, 1
respective, 1
parts., 1
I,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
tender, 1
father"--, 1
"And, 1
I, 1
as, 1
a, 1
dutiful, 1
son,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
choose, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
descended, 1
from, 1
you.", 1
"Whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
they?", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
hardly, 1
tell,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
alluding, 1
to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
letter;, 1
you, 1
received, 1
one,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"From, 1
whom?", 1
"From, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
"No,, 1

one, 1
figure,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
expected,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
two, 1
were, 1
approaching, 1
him., 1
The, 1
delay, 1
had, 1
been, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
from, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Eugenie,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
prolonged, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
time, 1
at, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
expected., 1
That, 1
she, 1
might, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
fail, 1
in, 1
her, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
Maximilian,, 1
she, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
that, 1
they, 1
should, 1
take, 1
a, 1
walk, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
being, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
show, 1
that, 1
the, 1
delay,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
doubtless, 1
a, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
vexation, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
was, 1
not, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
any, 1
neglect, 1
on, 1
her, 1
part., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
intuitive, 1
perception, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lover,, 1
quickly, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
was, 1
involuntarily, 1
placed,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
comforted., 1
Besides,, 1
although, 1
she, 1
avoided, 1
coming, 1
within, 1
speaking, 1
distance,, 1
Valentine, 1
arranged, 1
so, 1
that, 1
Maximilian, 1
could, 1
see, 1
her, 1
pass, 1
and, 1
repass,, 1
and, 1
each, 1
time, 1
she, 1
went, 1
by,, 1
she, 1
managed,, 1
unperceived, 1
by, 1
her, 1
companion,, 1
to, 1
cast, 1
an, 1
expressive, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"Have, 1
patience!, 1
You, 1
see, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
fault.", 1
And, 1
Maximilian, 1
was, 1
patient,, 1
and, 1
employed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
mentally, 1
contrasting, 1
the, 1
two, 1
girls,--one, 1
fair,, 1
with, 1
soft, 1
languishing, 1
eyes,, 1
a, 1
figure, 1
gracefully, 1
bending, 1
like, 1
a, 1
weeping, 1
willow;, 1
the, 1
other, 1
a, 1
brunette,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fierce, 1
and, 1
haughty, 1
expression,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
straight, 1
as, 1
a, 1
poplar., 1
It, 1
is, 1
unnecessary, 1
to, 1
state, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
Valentine, 1
did, 1
not, 1
suffer, 1
by, 1
the, 1
contrast., 1
In, 1
about, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
girls, 1
went, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
Maximilian, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars', 1
visit, 1
had, 1
at, 1
last, 1
come, 1
to, 1
an, 1
end., 1
In, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
Valentine, 1
re-entered, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
alone., 1
For, 1
fear, 1
that, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
be, 1
observing, 1
her, 1
return,, 1
she, 1
walked, 1
slowly;, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
immediately, 1
directing, 1
her, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
she, 1
seated, 1
herself, 1
on, 1
a, 1
bench,, 1
and,, 1
carefully, 1
casting, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
around,, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
herself, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
not, 1
watched,, 1
she, 1
presently, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
proceeded, 1
quickly, 1
to, 1
join, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Good-evening,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
well-known, 1
voice., 1
"Good-evening,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
I, 1
know, 1
I, 1
have, 1
kept, 1
you, 1
waiting,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
delay.", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
recognized, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars., 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
so, 1
intimate, 1
with, 1
her.", 1
"Who, 1
told, 1
you, 1
we, 1
were, 1
intimate,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
"No, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so., 1
From, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
walked, 1
and, 1
talked, 1
together,, 1
one, 1
would, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
were, 1
two, 1
school-girls, 1
telling, 1
your, 1
secrets, 1
to, 1
each, 1
other.", 1
"We, 1
were, 1
having, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
conversation,", 1
returned, 1
Valentine;, 1
"she, 1
was, 1
owning, 1
to, 1
me, 1
her, 1
repugnance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf;, 1
and, 1
I,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
hand,, 1
was, 1
confessing, 1
to, 1
her, 1
how, 1
wretched, 1
it, 1
made, 1
me, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay.", 1
"Dear, 1
Valentine!", 1
"That, 1
will, 1
account, 1
to, 1
you, 1
for, 1
the, 1
unreserved, 1
manner, 1
which, 1
you, 1
observed, 1
between, 1
me, 1
and, 1
Eugenie,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
speaking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
love,, 1
my, 1
thoughts, 1
involuntarily, 1
reverted, 1
to, 1
him, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
my, 1
affections, 1
were, 1
fixed.", 1
"Ah,, 1
how, 1
good, 1
you, 1
are, 1
to, 1
say, 1
so,, 1
Valentine!, 1
You, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
quality, 1
which, 1
can, 1
never, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars., 1
It, 1
is, 1
that, 1
indefinable, 1
charm, 1
which, 1
is, 1
to, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
what, 1
perfume, 1
is, 1
to, 1
the, 1
flower, 1
and, 1
flavor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fruit,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
either, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
only, 1
quality, 1
we, 1
seek.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
your, 1
love, 1
which, 1
makes, 1
you, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
that, 1
light.", 1
"No,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
such, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
case., 1
I, 1
was, 1
observing, 1
you, 1
both, 1
when, 1
you, 1
were, 1
walking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
and,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor,, 1
without, 1
at, 1
all, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
depreciate, 1
the, 1
beauty, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
understand, 1
how, 1
any, 1
man, 1
can, 1
really, 1
love, 1
her.", 1
"The, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
presence, 1
had, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
rendering, 1
you, 1
unjust, 1
in, 1
your, 1
comparison.", 1
"No;, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me--it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
question, 1
of, 1
simple, 1
curiosity,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
suggested, 1
by, 1
certain, 1
ideas, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
my, 1
mind, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars"--, 1
"I, 1
dare, 1
say, 1
it, 1
is, 1
something, 1
disparaging, 1
which, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
say., 1
It, 1
only, 1
proves, 1
how, 1
little, 1
indulgence, 1
we, 1
may, 1
expect, 1
from, 1
your, 1
sex,", 1
interrupted, 1
Valentine., 1
"You, 1
cannot,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
deny, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
very, 1
harsh, 1
judges, 1
of, 1
each, 1
other.", 1
"If, 1
we, 1
are, 1
so,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
because, 1
we, 1
generally, 1
judge, 1
under, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
excitement., 1
But, 1
return, 1
to, 1
your, 1
question.", 1
"Does, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
object, 1
to, 1
this, 1
marriage, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
loving, 1
another?", 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
on, 1
terms, 1
of, 1
strict, 1
intimacy, 1
with, 1
Eugenie.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
girls, 1
tell, 1
each, 1
other, 1
secrets, 1
without, 1
being, 1
particularly, 1
intimate;, 1
own,, 1
now,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
did, 1
question, 1
her, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
Ah,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
are, 1
smiling.", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
are, 1
already, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
that, 1
passed,, 1
the, 1
wooden, 1
partition, 1
which, 1
interposed, 1
between, 1
us, 1
and, 1
you, 1
has, 1
proved, 1
but, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
security.", 1
"Come,, 1
what, 1
did, 1
she, 1
say?", 1
"She, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
she, 1
loved, 1
no, 1
one,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"that, 1
she, 1
disliked, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
being, 1
married;, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
infinitely, 1
prefer, 1
leading, 1
an, 1
independent, 1
and, 1
unfettered, 1
life;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
almost, 1
wished, 1
her, 1
father, 1
might, 1
lose, 1
his, 1
fortune,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
might, 1
become, 1
an, 1
artist,, 1
like, 1
her, 1
friend,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly.", 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
see"--, 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
does, 1
that, 1
prove?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
"Nothing,", 1
replied, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Then, 1
why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
smile?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
very, 1
well, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
reflecting, 1
on, 1
yourself,, 1
Valentine.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
me, 1
to, 1
go, 1
away?", 1
"Ah,, 1
no,, 1
no., 1
But, 1
do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
us, 1
lose, 1
time;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
on, 1
which, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak.", 1
"True,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
be, 1
quick,, 1
for, 1
we, 1
have, 1
scarcely, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
more, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
together.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
in, 1
consternation., 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
but, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
friend, 1
to, 1
you., 1
What, 1
a, 1
life, 1
I, 1
cause, 1
you, 1
to, 1
lead,, 1
poor, 1
Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
who, 1
are, 1
formed, 1
for, 1
happiness!, 1
I, 1
bitterly, 1
reproach, 1
myself,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you.", 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
does, 1
it, 1
signify,, 1
Valentine,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
satisfied,, 1
and, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
even, 1
this, 1
long, 1
and, 1
painful, 1
suspense, 1
is, 1
amply, 1
repaid, 1
by, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
of, 1
your, 1
society,, 1
or, 1
two, 1
words, 1
from, 1
your, 1
lips?, 1
And, 1
I, 1
have, 1
also, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
heaven, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
created, 1
two, 1
hearts,, 1
harmonizing, 1
as, 1
ours, 1
do,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
miraculously, 1
brought, 1
us, 1
together,, 1
to, 1
separate, 1
us, 1
at, 1
last.", 1
"Those, 1
are, 1
kind, 1
and, 1
cheering, 1
words., 1
You, 1
must, 1
hope, 1
for, 1
us, 1
both,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
that, 1
will, 1
make, 1
me, 1
at, 1
least, 1
partly, 1
happy.", 1
"But, 1
why, 1
must, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
so, 1
soon?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
particulars., 1
I, 1
can, 1
only, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
request, 1
my, 1
presence,, 1

a, 1
communication, 1
to, 1
make, 1
on, 1
which, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
depended., 1
Let, 1
them, 1
take, 1
my, 1
fortune,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
already, 1
too, 1
rich;, 1
and,, 1
perhaps,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
it,, 1
they, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
in, 1
peace, 1
and, 1
quietness., 1
You, 1
would, 1
love, 1
me, 1
as, 1
much, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
poor,, 1
would, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
always, 1
love, 1
you., 1
What, 1
should, 1
I, 1
care, 1
for, 1
either, 1
riches, 1
or, 1
poverty,, 1
if, 1
my, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
near, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
certain, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
deprive, 1
me, 1
of, 1
her?, 1
But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
fear, 1
that, 1
this, 1
communication, 1
may, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
your, 1
marriage?", 1
"I, 1

that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
case.", 1
"However, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be,, 1
Valentine,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed., 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
that,, 1

long, 1

that,, 1
Maximilian.", 1
"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right., 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
brute., 1

I, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tell, 1

day.", 1
"Well?", 1
"Monsieur, 1
Franz, 1
is, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1

know.", 1
"What, 1
then?", 1
"Monsieur, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
has, 1
received, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
Franz,, 1
announcing, 1
his, 1
immediate, 1
return.", 1
Valentine, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1

leaned, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
against, 1
the, 1
gate., 1
"Ah, 1
heavens,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
that!, 1

no,, 1

communication, 1
would, 1

come, 1
through, 1

de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"Why, 1
not?", 1
"Because--I, 1
scarcely, 1
know, 1
why--but, 1
it, 1
has, 1
appeared, 1
as, 1

Madame, 1
de, 1

"Is, 1
it, 1
so?, 1

I, 1
feel, 1
as, 1

I, 1
could, 1
adore, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
hurry, 1
to, 1
do, 1
that,", 1

Valentine,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sad, 1
smile., 1

About, 1
a, 1
year, 1

proposition,, 1

was, 1

poor, 1
grandfather, 1

can, 1

no, 1

of, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
that, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eye, 1
when, 1

looks, 1
at, 1
me,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
person, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1

had, 1
almost, 1
said,, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
is, 1
beloved, 1
in, 1
return., 1
When, 1
he, 1
learned, 1
my, 1
resolution,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
forget, 1
the, 1
reproachful, 1
look, 1
which, 1
he, 1
cast, 1
on, 1
me,, 1

of, 1

chased, 1

other, 1
down, 1

"Ah,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
you, 1
are, 1
mistaken.", 1
"If, 1
it, 1
were, 1
otherwise--if, 1
he, 1
treated, 1
me, 1
diplomatically--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
wishes,, 1
by, 1
some, 1
means, 1
or, 1
other,, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
footing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
may, 1
ultimately, 1
gain, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
dictating, 1
to, 1
its, 1
occupants--he, 1
would,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
but, 1
once,, 1
have, 1
honored, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
smile, 1
which, 1
you, 1
extol, 1
so, 1
loudly;, 1
but, 1
no,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
unhappy,, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
be, 1
of, 1
no, 1
use, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
me, 1
whatever., 1
Who, 1
knows, 1
but, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
please, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
he, 1
may, 1
not, 1
persecute, 1
me, 1
by, 1
every, 1
means, 1
in, 1
his, 1
power?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
just, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
despise, 1
me, 1
so,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
reason., 1
Ah,, 1
forgive, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
perceiving, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
which, 1
her, 1
words, 1
were, 1
producing, 1
on, 1
Maximilian:, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
done, 1
wrong,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
thoughts, 1
concerning, 1
that, 1
man, 1
which, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
know, 1
existed, 1
in, 1
my, 1
heart., 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
deny, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
speak,, 1
or, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
myself, 1
experienced, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
me, 1
it, 1
has, 1
been, 1
productive, 1
of, 1
evil, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
good.", 1
"Well,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
"we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
discuss, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
further., 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
make, 1
a, 1
confidant, 1
of, 1
him.", 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
given, 1
you, 1
pain., 1
I, 1
can, 1
only, 1
say, 1
how, 1
sincerely, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
having, 1
griefed, 1
you., 1
But,, 1
indeed,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
prejudiced, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
conviction., 1
Tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
this, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
has, 1
done, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
own, 1
that, 1
your, 1
question, 1
embarrasses, 1
me,, 1
Valentine,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
has, 1
rendered, 1
me, 1
any, 1
ostensible, 1
service., 1
Still,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you, 1
I, 1
have, 1
an, 1
instinctive, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
the, 1
source, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
you., 1
Has, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
done, 1
anything, 1
for, 1
me?, 1
No;, 1
he, 1
warms, 1
me, 1
with, 1
his, 1
rays,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
by, 1
his, 1
light, 1
that, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you--nothing, 1
more., 1
Has, 1
such, 1
and, 1
such, 1
a, 1
perfume, 1
done, 1
anything, 1
for, 1
me?, 1
No;, 1
its, 1
odor, 1
charms, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
senses--that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
when, 1
I, 1
am, 1
asked, 1
why, 1
I, 1
praise, 1
it., 1
My, 1
friendship, 1
for, 1
him, 1
is, 1
as, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
unaccountable, 1
as, 1
his, 1
for, 1
me., 1
A, 1
secret, 1
voice, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
whisper, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
there, 1
must, 1
be, 1
something, 1
more, 1
than, 1
chance, 1
in, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
reciprocity, 1
of, 1
friendship., 1
In, 1
his, 1
most, 1
simple, 1
actions,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
in, 1
his, 1
most, 1
secret, 1
thoughts,, 1
I, 1
find, 1
a, 1
relation, 1
to, 1
my, 1
own., 1
You, 1
will, 1
perhaps, 1
smile, 1
at, 1
me, 1
when, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that,, 1
ever, 1
since, 1
I, 1
have, 1
known, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
involuntarily, 1
entertained, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
which, 1
has, 1
befallen, 1
me, 1
originated, 1
from, 1
him., 1
However,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
live, 1
thirty, 1
years, 1
without, 1
this, 1
protection,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
endeavor, 1
a, 1
little, 1
to, 1
illustrate, 1
my, 1
meaning., 1
He, 1
invited, 1
me, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
with, 1
him, 1
on, 1
Saturday,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
natural, 1
thing, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
do., 1
Well,, 1
what, 1
have, 1
I, 1
learned, 1
since?, 1
That, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
are, 1
both, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
this, 1
dinner., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
meet, 1
them, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
what, 1
future, 1
advantages, 1
may, 1
result, 1
from, 1
the, 1
interview?, 1
This, 1
may, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
no, 1
unusual, 1
combination, 1
of, 1
circumstances;, 1
nevertheless,, 1
I, 1
perceive, 1
some, 1
hidden, 1
plot, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arrangement--something,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
more, 1
than, 1
is, 1
apparent, 1
on, 1
a, 1
casual, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
I, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
this, 1
singular, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
fathom, 1
the, 1
motives, 1
of, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
has, 1
purposely, 1
arranged, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
sometimes,, 1
I, 1
confess,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
gone, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
try, 1
to, 1
read, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
our, 1
love.", 1
"My, 1
good, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
take, 1
you, 1
for, 1
a, 1
visionary,, 1
and, 1
should, 1
tremble, 1
for, 1
your, 1
reason,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
always, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
you, 1
talk, 1
in, 1
a, 1
strain, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
this., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
that, 1
you, 1
can, 1
see, 1
anything, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
merest, 1
chance, 1
in, 1
this, 1
meeting?, 1
Pray, 1
reflect, 1
a, 1
little., 1
My, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
never, 1
goes, 1
out,, 1
has, 1
several, 1
times, 1
been, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
refusing, 1
this, 1
invitation;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
is, 1
burning, 1
with, 1
the, 1
desire, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
this, 1
extraordinary, 1
nabob, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
house,, 1
therefore,, 1
she, 1
has, 1
with, 1
great, 1
difficulty, 1
prevailed, 1
on, 1
my, 1
father, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
her., 1
No,, 1
no;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
Maximilian,--there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
one, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
can, 1
ask, 1
help, 1
but, 1
yourself, 1
and, 1
my, 1
grandfather,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
little, 1
better, 1
than, 1
a, 1
corpse.", 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
logically, 1
speaking,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian;, 1
"but, 1
the, 1
gentle, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
usually, 1
has, 1
such, 1
power, 1
over, 1
me, 1
fails, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
me, 1
to-day.", 1
"I, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
regards, 1
yourself.", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
own, 1
that,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
stronger, 1
proof, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me"--, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
another,", 1
replied, 1
Maximilian;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
fear, 1
you, 1
will, 1
deem, 1
it, 1
even, 1
more, 1
absurd, 1
than, 1
the, 1
first.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
worse,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
smiling., 1
"It, 1
is,, 1
nevertheless,, 1
conclusive, 1
to, 1
my, 1
mind., 1
My, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
service, 1
have, 1
also, 1
confirmed, 1
my, 1
ideas, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
sudden, 1
inspirations,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
several, 1
times, 1
owed, 1
my, 1
life, 1
to, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
impulse, 1
which, 1
directed, 1
me, 1
to, 1
move, 1
at, 1
once, 1
either, 1
to, 1
the, 1
right, 1
or, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
which, 1
killed, 1
the, 1
comrade, 1
fighting, 1
by, 1
my, 1
side,, 1
while, 1
it, 1
left, 1
me, 1
unharmed.", 1
"Dear, 1
Maximilian,, 1
why, 1
not, 1
attribute, 1
your, 1
escape, 1
to, 1
my, 1
constant, 1
prayers, 1
for, 1
your, 1
safety?, 1
When, 1
you, 1
are, 1
away,, 1
I, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
pray, 1
for, 1
myself,, 1
but, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"Yes,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
known, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
smiling;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
cannot, 1
apply, 1
to, 1
the, 1
time, 1
previous, 1
to, 1
our, 1
acquaintance,, 1
Valentine.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
very, 1
provoking,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
not, 1
give, 1
me, 1
credit, 1
for, 1
anything;, 1
but, 1
let, 1
me, 1
hear, 1
this, 1
second, 1
proof,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
yourself, 1
own, 1
to, 1
be, 1
absurd.", 1
"Well,, 1
look, 1
through, 1
this, 1
opening,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
new, 1
horse, 1
which, 1
I, 1
rode, 1
here.", 1
"Ah,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
creature!", 1
cried, 1
Valentine;, 1
"why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
him, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
talk, 1
to, 1
him, 1
and, 1
pat, 1
him?", 1
"He, 1
is,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
a, 1
very, 1
valuable, 1
animal,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
my, 1
means, 1
are, 1
limited,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
what, 1
would, 1
be, 1
designated, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
moderate, 1
pretensions., 1
Well,, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
dealer's,, 1
where, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
this, 1
magnificent, 1
horse,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
named, 1
Medeah., 1
I, 1
asked, 1
the, 1
price;, 1
they, 1
told, 1
me, 1
it, 1
was, 1
4,500, 1
francs., 1
I, 1
was,, 1
therefore,, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
give, 1
it, 1
up,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
imagine,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
own, 1
I, 1
went, 1
away, 1
with, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
heart,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
had, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
me, 1
affectionately,, 1
had, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
head, 1
against, 1
me, 1
and,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
mounted, 1
him,, 1
had, 1
pranced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
delightful, 1
way, 1
imaginable,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
altogether, 1
fascinated, 1
with, 1
him., 1
The, 1
same, 1
evening, 1
some, 1
friends, 1
of, 1
mine, 1
visited, 1
me,--M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
and, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
other, 1
choice, 1
spirits,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
even, 1
by, 1
name., 1
They, 1
proposed, 1
a, 1
game, 1
of, 1
bouillotte., 1
I, 1
never, 1
play,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
rich, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
afford, 1
to, 1
lose,, 1
or, 1
sufficiently, 1
poor, 1
to, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
gain., 1
But, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
my, 1
own, 1
house,, 1
you, 1
understand,, 1
so, 1
there, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
done, 1
but, 1
to, 1
send, 1
for, 1
the, 1
cards,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
did., 1
"Just, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
sitting, 1
down, 1
to, 1
table,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
arrived., 1
He, 1
took, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
amongst, 1
them;, 1
they, 1
played,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
won., 1
I, 1
am, 1
almost, 1
ashamed, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
my, 1
gains, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
5,000, 1
francs., 1
We, 1
separated, 1
at, 1
midnight., 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
defer, 1
my, 1
pleasure,, 1
so, 1
I, 1
took, 1
a, 1
cabriolet, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
to, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
dealer's., 1
Feverish, 1
and, 1
excited,, 1
I, 1
rang, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
person, 1
who, 1
opened, 1
it, 1
must, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
me, 1
for, 1
a, 1
madman,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
rushed, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
the, 1
stable., 1
Medeah, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
rack,, 1
eating, 1
his, 1
hay., 1
I, 1
immediately, 1
put, 1
on, 1
the, 1
saddle, 1
and, 1
bridle,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
operation, 1
he, 1
lent, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
the, 1
best, 1
grace, 1
possible;, 1
then,, 1
putting, 1
the, 1
4,500, 1
francs, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
astonished, 1
dealer,, 1
I, 1
proceeded, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
my, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
night, 1
in, 1
riding, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees., 1
As, 1
I, 1
rode, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
house, 1
I, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
light, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
fancied, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
his, 1
figure, 1
moving, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
curtain., 1
Now,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
firmly, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
of, 1
my, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
this, 1
horse,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
lost, 1
expressly, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
procuring, 1
him.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
too, 1
fanciful;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
love, 1
even, 1
me, 1
long., 1
A, 1
man, 1
who, 1
accustoms, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
live, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
world, 1
of, 1
poetry, 1
and, 1
imagination, 1
must, 1
find, 1
far, 1
too, 1
little, 1
excitement, 1
in, 1
a, 1
common,, 1
every-day, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
attachment, 1
such, 1
as, 1
ours., 1
But, 1
they, 1
are, 1
calling, 1
me., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
hear?", 1
"Ah,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"give, 1
me, 1
but, 1
one, 1
finger, 1
through, 1
this, 1
opening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grating,, 1
one, 1
finger,, 1
the, 1
littlest, 1
finger, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
of, 1
kissing, 1
it.", 1
"Maximilian,, 1
we, 1
said, 1
we, 1
would, 1
be, 1
to, 1
each, 1
other, 1
as, 1
two, 1
voices,, 1
two, 1
shadows.", 1
"As, 1
you, 1
will,, 1
Valentine.", 1
"Shall, 1
you, 1
be, 1
happy, 1
if, 1
I, 1
do, 1
what, 1
you, 1
wish?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes!", 1
Valentine, 1
mounted, 1
on, 1
a, 1
bench,, 1
and, 1
passed, 1
not, 1
only, 1
her, 1
finger, 1
but, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
hand, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening., 1
Maximilian, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
delight,, 1
and,, 1
springing, 1
forwards,, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
extended, 1
towards, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
imprinted, 1
on, 1
it, 1
a, 1
fervent, 1
and, 1
impassioned, 1
kiss., 1
The, 1
little, 1
hand, 1
was, 1
then, 1
immediately, 1
withdrawn,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
saw, 1
Valentine, 1
hurrying, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
she, 1
were, 1
almost, 1
terrified, 1
at, 1
her, 1
own, 1
sensations., 1
Chapter, 1
58., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
We, 1
will, 1
now, 1
relate, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney, 1
after, 1
the, 1
departure, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
between, 1
Maximilian, 1
and, 1
Valentine,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
just, 1
detailed., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
room,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
Both, 1
of, 1
the, 1
visitors,, 1
after, 1
saluting, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
and, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
Barrois,, 1
a, 1
faithful, 1
servant,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
twenty-five, 1
years, 1
in, 1
his, 1
service,, 1
took, 1
their, 1
places, 1
on, 1
either, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arm-chair,, 1
which, 1
moved, 1
upon, 1
casters,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
wheeled, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
way, 1
drawn, 1
out, 1
again, 1
at, 1
night., 1
He, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
before, 1
a, 1
large, 1
glass,, 1
which, 1
reflected, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
apartment,, 1
and, 1
so,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
move,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
impossible,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
see, 1
all, 1
who, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
which, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on, 1
around, 1
him., 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
although, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
immovable, 1
as, 1
a, 1
corpse,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
new-comers, 1
with, 1
a, 1
quick, 1
and, 1
intelligent, 1
expression,, 1
perceiving, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
by, 1
their, 1
ceremonious, 1
courtesy,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
come, 1
on, 1
business, 1
of, 1
an, 1
unexpected, 1
and, 1
official, 1
character., 1
Sight, 1
and, 1
hearing, 1
were, 1
the, 1
only, 1
senses, 1
remaining,, 1
and, 1
they,, 1
like, 1
two, 1
solitary, 1
sparks,, 1
remained, 1
to, 1
animate, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
body, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
fit, 1
for, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
grave;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only,, 1
however,, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
senses, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
reveal, 1
the, 1
thoughts, 1
and, 1
feelings, 1
that, 1
still, 1
occupied, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
look, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
expression, 1
to, 1
his, 1
inner, 1
life, 1
was, 1
like, 1
the, 1
distant, 1
gleam, 1
of, 1
a, 1
candle, 1
which, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
sees, 1
by, 1
night, 1
across, 1
some, 1
desert, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
knows, 1
that, 1
a, 1
living, 1
being, 1
dwells, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
and, 1
obscurity., 1
Noirtier's, 1
hair, 1
was, 1
long, 1
and, 1
white,, 1
and, 1
flowed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
shoulders;, 1
while, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
shaded, 1
by, 1
thick, 1
black, 1
lashes,, 1
was, 1
concentrated,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
often, 1
happens, 1
with, 1
an, 1
organ, 1
which, 1
is, 1
used, 1
to, 1
the, 1
exclusion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
others,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
activity,, 1
address,, 1
force,, 1
and, 1
intelligence, 1
which, 1
were, 1
formerly, 1
diffused, 1
over, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
body;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
although, 1
the, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arm,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
agility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
body,, 1
were, 1
wanting,, 1
the, 1
speaking, 1
eye, 1
sufficed, 1
for, 1
all., 1
He, 1
commanded, 1
with, 1
it;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
medium, 1
through, 1
which, 1
his, 1
thanks, 1
were, 1
conveyed., 1
In, 1
short,, 1
his, 1
whole, 1
appearance, 1
produced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
the, 1
impression, 1
of, 1
a, 1
corpse, 1
with, 1
living, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
could, 1
be, 1
more, 1
startling, 1
than, 1
to, 1
observe, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
anger, 1
or, 1
joy, 1
suddenly, 1
lighting, 1
up, 1
these, 1
organs,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rigid, 1
and, 1
marble-like, 1
features, 1
were, 1
utterly, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
participation., 1
Three, 1
persons, 1
only, 1
could, 1
understand, 1
this, 1
language, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
paralytic;, 1
these, 1
were, 1
Villefort,, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
have, 1
already, 1
spoken., 1
But, 1
as, 1
Villefort, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
father, 1
but, 1
seldom,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
only, 1
when, 1
absolutely, 1
obliged,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
never, 1
took, 1
any, 1
pains, 1
to, 1
please, 1
or, 1
gratify, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
there,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
happiness, 1
was, 1
centred, 1
in, 1
his, 1
granddaughter., 1
Valentine,, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
her, 1
love,, 1
her, 1
patience,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
devotion,, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
to, 1
read, 1
in, 1
Noirtier's, 1
look, 1
all, 1
the, 1
varied, 1
feelings, 1
which, 1
were, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
To, 1
this, 1
dumb, 1
language,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
unintelligible, 1
to, 1
others,, 1
she, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
throwing, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
soul, 1
into, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
her, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
this, 1
manner, 1
were, 1
the, 1
conversations, 1
sustained, 1
between, 1
the, 1
blooming, 1
girl, 1
and, 1
the, 1
helpless, 1
invalid,, 1
whose, 1
body, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
be, 1
called, 1
a, 1
living, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
who,, 1
nevertheless,, 1
possessed, 1
a, 1
fund, 1
of, 1
knowledge, 1
and, 1
penetration,, 1
united, 1
with, 1
a, 1
will, 1
as, 1
powerful, 1
as, 1
ever, 1
although, 1
clogged, 1
by, 1
a, 1
body, 1
rendered, 1
utterly, 1
incapable, 1
of, 1
obeying, 1
its, 1
impulses., 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
solved, 1
the, 1
problem,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
able, 1
easily, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
his, 1
thoughts,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
her, 1
own, 1
in, 1
return,, 1
and,, 1
through, 1
her, 1
untiring, 1
and, 1
devoted, 1
assiduity,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
seldom, 1
that,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ordinary, 1
transactions, 1
of, 1
every-day, 1
life,, 1
she, 1
failed, 1
to, 1
anticipate, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
living,, 1
thinking, 1
mind,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
wants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
inanimate, 1
body., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
servant,, 1
he, 1
had,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
been, 1
with, 1
his, 1
master, 1
for, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
years,, 1
therefore, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
all, 1
his, 1
habits,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
seldom, 1
that, 1
Noirtier, 1
found, 1
it, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
anything,, 1
so, 1
prompt, 1
was, 1
he, 1
in, 1
administering, 1
to, 1
all, 1
the, 1
necessities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
invalid., 1
Villefort, 1
did, 1
not, 1
need, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
either, 1
Valentine, 1
or, 1
the, 1
domestic, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
on, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
conversation, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin., 1
As, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
he, 1
perfectly, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
vocabulary,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
use, 1
it, 1
more, 1
often,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
indifference, 1
and, 1
ennui, 1
which, 1
prevented, 1
him, 1
from, 1
so, 1
doing., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
allowed, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
go, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
sent, 1
away, 1
Barrois,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
right, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
placed, 1
herself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
he, 1
addressed, 1
him, 1
thus:--, 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
displeased,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
has, 1
not, 1
come, 1
with, 1
us,, 1
or, 1
that, 1
I, 1
dismissed, 1
Barrois,, 1
for, 1
our, 1
conference, 1
will, 1
be, 1
one, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
with, 1
propriety, 1
be, 1
carried, 1
on, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
either., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
communication, 1
to, 1
make, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
face, 1
remained, 1
perfectly, 1
passive, 1
during, 1
this, 1
long, 1
preamble,, 1
while,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
Villefort's, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
into, 1
the, 1
inmost, 1
recesses, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
heart., 1
"This, 1
communication,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
in, 1
that, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
decisive, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
preclude, 1
all, 1
discussion,, 1
"will,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
sure,, 1
meet, 1
with, 1
your, 1
approbation.", 1
The, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
invalid, 1
still, 1
retained, 1
that, 1
vacancy, 1
of, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
prevented, 1
his, 1
son, 1
from, 1
obtaining, 1
any, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
which, 1
were, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind;, 1
he, 1
listened,, 1
nothing, 1
more., 1
"Sir,", 1
resumed, 1
Villefort,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
Valentine.", 1
Had, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
face, 1
been, 1
moulded, 1
in, 1
wax, 1
it, 1
could, 1
not, 1
have, 1
shown, 1
less, 1
emotion, 1
at, 1
this, 1
news, 1
than, 1
was, 1
now, 1
to, 1
be, 1
traced, 1
there., 1
"The, 1
marriage, 1
will, 1
take, 1
place, 1
in, 1
less, 1
than, 1
three, 1
months,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
still, 1
retained, 1
its, 1
inanimate, 1
expression., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
now, 1
took, 1
her, 1
part, 1
in, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
and, 1
added,--"We, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
news, 1
would, 1
possess, 1
an, 1
interest, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
always, 1
entertained, 1
a, 1
great, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
Valentine;, 1
it, 1
therefore, 1
only, 1
now, 1
remains, 1
for, 1
us, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
is, 1
destined., 1
It, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
desirable, 1
connections, 1
which, 1
could, 1
possibly, 1
be, 1
formed;, 1
he, 1
possesses, 1
fortune,, 1
a, 1
high, 1
rank, 1
in, 1
society,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
personal, 1
qualification, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
render, 1
Valentine, 1
supremely, 1
happy,--his, 1
name,, 1
moreover,, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
wholly, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
you., 1
It, 1
is, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
de, 1
Quesnel,, 1
Baron, 1
d'Epinay.", 1
While, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
was, 1
speaking,, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
narrowly, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
countenance., 1
When, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
pronounced, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Franz,, 1
the, 1
pupil, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
began, 1
to, 1
dilate,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyelids, 1
trembled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
movement, 1
that, 1
may, 1
be, 1
perceived, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
an, 1
individual, 1
about, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
darted, 1
a, 1
lightning, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son., 1
The, 1
procureur,, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
political, 1
hatred, 1
which, 1
had, 1
formerly, 1
existed, 1
between, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
the, 1
elder, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
well, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
agitation, 1
and, 1
anger, 1
which, 1
the, 1
announcement, 1
had, 1
produced;, 1
but,, 1
feigning, 1
not, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
either,, 1
he, 1
immediately, 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
narrative, 1
begun, 1
by, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
her, 1
nineteenth, 1
year,, 1
which, 1
renders, 1
it, 1
important, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
lose, 1
no, 1
time, 1
in, 1
forming, 1
a, 1
suitable, 1
alliance., 1
Nevertheless,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
forgotten, 1
in, 1
our, 1
plans,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
have, 1
fully, 1
ascertained, 1
beforehand, 1
that, 1
Valentine's, 1
future, 1
husband, 1
will, 1
consent,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
live, 1
in, 1
this, 1
house,, 1
for, 1
that, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
pleasant, 1
for, 1
the, 1
young, 1
people,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
live, 1
with, 1
them;, 1
so, 1
that, 1
you, 1
and, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
so, 1
attached, 1
to, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
separated,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
would, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
pursue, 1
exactly, 1
the, 1
same, 1
course, 1
of, 1
life, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
hitherto, 1
done,, 1
and, 1
thus,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
losing,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
gainer, 1
by, 1
the, 1
change,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
will, 1
secure, 1
to, 1
you, 1
two, 1
children, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
one,, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
and, 1
comfort, 1
you.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
look, 1
was, 1
furious;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
very, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
something, 1
desperate, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
mind,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
anger, 1
and, 1
grief, 1
rose, 1
in, 1
his, 1
throat,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
find, 1
vent, 1
in, 1
utterance,, 1
appeared, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
choke, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
face, 1
and, 1
lips, 1
turned, 1
quite, 1
purple, 1
with, 1
the, 1
struggle., 1
Villefort, 1
quietly, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
window,, 1
saying,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
warm,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
affects, 1
M., 1
Noirtier.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
place,, 1
but, 1
did, 1
not, 1
sit, 1
down., 1
"This, 1
marriage,", 1
added, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"is, 1
quite, 1
agreeable, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
and, 1
his, 1
family;, 1
besides,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
relations, 1
nearer, 1
than, 1
an, 1
uncle, 1
and, 1
aunt,, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
having, 1
died, 1
at, 1
his, 1
birth,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father, 1
having, 1
been, 1
assassinated, 1
in, 1
1815,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
but, 1
two, 1
years, 1
old;, 1
it, 1
naturally, 1
followed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
child, 1
was, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
choose, 1
his, 1
own, 1
pursuits,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
has,, 1
therefore,, 1
seldom, 1
acknowledged, 1
any, 1
other, 1
authority, 1
but, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
will.", 1
"That, 1
assassination, 1
was, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
affair,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
perpetrators, 1
have, 1
hitherto, 1
escaped, 1
detection,, 1
although, 1
suspicion, 1
has, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
more, 1
than, 1
one, 1
person.", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
such, 1
an, 1
effort, 1
that, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
expanded, 1
into, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"Now,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort,, 1
"those, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
guilt, 1
really, 1
belongs,, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
was, 1
committed,, 1
on, 1
whose, 1
heads, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
of, 1
man, 1
may, 1
probably, 1
descend, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
certain, 1
judgment, 1
of, 1
God, 1
hereafter,, 1
would, 1
rejoice, 1
in, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
thus, 1
afforded, 1
of, 1
bestowing, 1
such, 1
a, 1
peace-offering, 1
as, 1
Valentine, 1
on, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
him, 1
whose, 1
life, 1
they, 1
so, 1
ruthlessly, 1
destroyed.", 1
Noirtier, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
mastering, 1
his, 1
emotion, 1
more, 1
than, 1
could, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deemed, 1
possible, 1
with, 1
such, 1
an, 1
enfeebled, 1
and, 1
shattered, 1
frame., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
understand,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
reply, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
look;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
look, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
strong, 1
indignation,, 1
mixed, 1
with, 1
profound, 1
contempt., 1
Villefort, 1
fully, 1
understood, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
meaning,, 1
and, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
shrug, 1
of, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
He, 1
then, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
to, 1
take, 1
leave., 1
"Now, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
bid, 1
you, 1
farewell., 1
Would, 1
you, 1
like, 1
me, 1
to, 1
send, 1
Edward, 1
to, 1
you, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time?", 1
It, 1
had, 1
been, 1
agreed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
should, 1
express, 1
his, 1
approbation, 1
by, 1
closing, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
his, 1
refusal, 1
by, 1
winking, 1
them, 1
several, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
some, 1
desire, 1
or, 1
feeling, 1
to, 1
express,, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
them, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
If, 1
he, 1
wanted, 1
Valentine,, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
right, 1
eye, 1
only,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
Barrois,, 1
the, 1
left., 1
At, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
proposition, 1
he, 1
instantly, 1
winked, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
Provoked, 1
by, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
refusal,, 1
she, 1
bit, 1
her, 1
lip, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"Then, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
send, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
eagerly,, 1
thereby, 1
intimating, 1
that, 1
such, 1
was, 1
his, 1
wish., 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
bowed, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
giving, 1
orders, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
should, 1
be, 1
summoned, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandfather's, 1
presence,, 1
and, 1
feeling, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
have, 1
much, 1
to, 1
do, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
calmness, 1
to, 1
the, 1
perturbed, 1
spirit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
invalid., 1
Valentine,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
color, 1
still, 1
heightened, 1
by, 1
emotion,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
just, 1
after, 1
her, 1
parents, 1
had, 1
quitted, 1
it., 1
One, 1
look, 1
was, 1
sufficient, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
her, 1
that, 1
her, 1
grandfather, 1
was, 1
suffering,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
much, 1
on, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
communicate, 1
to, 1
her., 1
"Dear, 1
grandpapa,", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
"what, 1
has, 1
happened?, 1
They, 1
have, 1
vexed, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
angry?", 1
The, 1
paralytic, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
assent., 1
"Who, 1
has, 1
displeased, 1
you?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
my, 1
father?", 1
"No.", 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
"No.", 1
"Me?", 1
The, 1
former, 1
sign, 1
was, 1
repeated., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
displeased, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
cried, 1
Valentine, 1
in, 1
astonishment., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
again, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
have, 1
I, 1
done,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
be, 1
angry, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
cried, 1
Valentine., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
answer,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
continued., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
you, 1
all, 1
day., 1
Has, 1
any, 1
one, 1
been, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
you, 1
against, 1
me?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
look,, 1
with, 1
eagerness., 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
think, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
I, 1
do, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
grandpapa--Ah--M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
have, 1
just, 1
left, 1
this, 1
room,, 1
have, 1
they, 1
not?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
it, 1
was, 1
they, 1
who, 1
told, 1
you, 1
something, 1
which, 1
made, 1
you, 1
angry?, 1
What, 1
was, 1
it, 1
then?, 1
May, 1
I, 1
go, 1
and, 1
ask, 1
them,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
making, 1
my, 1
peace, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"No,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
Noirtier's, 1
look., 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
frighten, 1
me., 1
What, 1
can, 1
they, 1
have, 1
said?", 1
and, 1
she, 1
again, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
think, 1
what, 1
it, 1
could, 1
be., 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
lowering, 1
her, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
going, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"They, 1
have, 1
been, 1
speaking, 1
of, 1
my, 1
marriage,--have, 1
they, 1
not?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
angry, 1
look., 1
"I, 1
understand;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
displeased, 1
at, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
I, 1
have, 1
preserved, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
The, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
insisted, 1
on, 1
my, 1
keeping, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
a, 1
secret,, 1
and, 1
begged, 1
me, 1
not, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
it., 1
They, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
acquaint, 1
me, 1
with, 1
their, 1
intentions,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
only, 1
discovered, 1
them, 1
by, 1
chance,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
why, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
reserved, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa., 1
Pray, 1
forgive, 1
me.", 1
But, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
look, 1
calculated, 1
to, 1
reassure, 1
her;, 1
all, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say, 1
was,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
only, 1
your, 1
reserve, 1
which, 1
afflicts, 1
me.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it,, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
"Perhaps, 1
you, 1
think, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
abandon, 1
you,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
forget, 1
you, 1
when, 1
I, 1
am, 1
married?", 1
"No.", 1
"They, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
consented, 1
to, 1
our, 1
all, 1
living, 1
together?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
why, 1
are, 1
you, 1
still, 1
vexed, 1
and, 1
grieved?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
beamed, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
gentle, 1
affection., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
because, 1
you, 1
love, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
assented., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
are, 1
afraid, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
unhappy?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
like, 1
M., 1
Franz?", 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
repeated, 1
several, 1
times,, 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
no.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
are, 1
vexed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
engagement?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
listen,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
throwing, 1
herself, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
putting, 1
her, 1
arm, 1
round, 1
her, 1
grandfather's, 1
neck,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
vexed,, 1
too,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
love, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay.", 1
An, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
intense, 1
joy, 1
illumined, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes., 1
"When, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
retire, 1
into, 1
a, 1
convent,, 1
you, 1
remember, 1
how, 1
angry, 1
you, 1
were, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
A, 1
tear, 1
trembled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
invalid., 1
"Well,", 1
continued, 1
Valentine,, 1
"the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
my, 1
proposing, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
escape, 1
this, 1
hateful, 1
marriage,, 1
which, 1
drives, 1
me, 1
to, 1
despair.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
breathing, 1
came, 1
thick, 1
and, 1
short., 1
"Then, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
this, 1
marriage, 1
really, 1
grieves, 1
you, 1
too?, 1
Ah,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
could, 1
but, 1
help, 1
me--if, 1
we, 1
could, 1
both, 1
together, 1
defeat, 1
their, 1
plan!, 1
But, 1
you, 1
are, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
oppose, 1
them,--you,, 1
whose, 1
mind, 1
is, 1
so, 1
quick,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
will, 1
is, 1
so, 1
firm, 1
are, 1
nevertheless,, 1
as, 1
weak, 1
and, 1
unequal, 1
to, 1
the, 1
contest, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
myself., 1
Alas,, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
such, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
protector, 1
to, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
days, 1
of, 1
your, 1
health, 1
and, 1
strength,, 1
can, 1
now, 1
only, 1
sympathize, 1
in, 1
my, 1
joys, 1
and, 1
sorrows,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
take, 1
any, 1
active, 1
part, 1
in, 1
them., 1
However,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
calls, 1
for, 1
gratitude, 1
and, 1
heaven, 1
has, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
all, 1
my, 1
blessings, 1
when, 1
it, 1
leaves, 1
me, 1
your, 1
sympathy, 1
and, 1
kindness.", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
there, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
such, 1
deep, 1
meaning, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
thought, 1
she, 1
could, 1
read, 1
these, 1
words, 1
there:, 1
"You, 1
are, 1
mistaken;, 1
I, 1
can, 1
still, 1
do, 1
much, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
you, 1
can, 1
help, 1
me,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa?", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"Yes.", 1
Noirtier, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
sign, 1
agreed, 1
on, 1
between, 1
him, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
when, 1
he, 1
wanted, 1
anything., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you, 1
want,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa?", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
to, 1
mind, 1
all, 1
the, 1
things, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
need;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
ideas, 1
presented, 1
themselves, 1
to, 1
her, 1
mind,, 1
she, 1
repeated, 1
them, 1
aloud,, 1
then,--finding, 1
that, 1
all, 1
her, 1
efforts, 1
elicited, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
a, 1
constant, 1
"No,"--she, 1
said,, 1
"Come,, 1
since, 1
this, 1
plan, 1
does, 1
not, 1
answer,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
have, 1
recourse, 1
to, 1
another.", 1
She, 1
then, 1
recited, 1
all, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
alphabet, 1
from, 1
A, 1
down, 1
to, 1
N., 1
When, 1
she, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
that, 1
letter, 1
the, 1
paralytic, 1
made, 1
her, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
the, 1
initial, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
he, 1
wanted., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"the, 1
thing, 1
you, 1
desire, 1
begins, 1
with, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
N;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
with, 1
N, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
then., 1
Well,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
see,, 1
what, 1
can, 1
you, 1
want, 1
that, 1
begins, 1
with, 1
N?, 1
Na--Ne--Ni--No"--, 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eye., 1
"Ah,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
No,, 1
then?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Valentine, 1
fetched, 1
a, 1
dictionary,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
desk, 1
before, 1
Noirtier;, 1
she, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
odd, 1
man's, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
thoroughly, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
its, 1
pages,, 1
she, 1
ran, 1
her, 1
finger, 1
quickly, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
the, 1
columns., 1
During, 1
the, 1
six, 1
years, 1
which, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
since, 1
Noirtier, 1
first, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
this, 1
sad, 1
state,, 1
Valentine's, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
invention, 1
had, 1
been, 1
too, 1
often, 1
put, 1
to, 1
the, 1
test, 1
not, 1
to, 1
render, 1
her, 1
expert, 1
in, 1
devising, 1
expedients, 1
for, 1
gaining, 1
a, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wishes,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
constant, 1
practice, 1
had, 1
so, 1
perfected, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
art, 1
that, 1
she, 1
guessed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
meaning, 1
as, 1
quickly, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
for, 1
what, 1
he, 1
wanted., 1
At, 1
the, 1
word, 1
"Notary,", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
her, 1
to, 1
stop., 1
"Notary,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
a, 1
notary,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
again, 1
signified, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
notary, 1
he, 1
desired., 1
"You, 1
would, 1
wish, 1
a, 1
notary, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"Yes.", 1
"Shall, 1
my, 1
father, 1
be, 1
informed, 1
of, 1
your, 1
wish?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
immediately?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
they, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
for, 1
him, 1
directly,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa., 1
Is, 1
that, 1
all, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Valentine, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
Monsieur, 1
or, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
requested, 1
to, 1
come, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
room., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
satisfied, 1
now?", 1
inquired, 1
Valentine., 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
are;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
very, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
that,"--and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
smiled, 1
on, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
child., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
entered,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Barrois., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
me, 1
for,, 1
sir?", 1
demanded, 1
he, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"my, 1
grandfather, 1
wishes, 1
for, 1
a, 1
notary.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
unexpected, 1
demand, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father, 1
exchanged, 1
looks., 1
"Yes,", 1
motioned, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firmness, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
declare, 1
that, 1
with, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
his, 1
old, 1
servant,, 1
who, 1
both, 1
knew, 1
what, 1
his, 1
wishes, 1
were,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
the, 1
contest., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
a, 1
notary?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes.", 1
"What, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
no, 1
answer., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
with, 1
a, 1
notary?", 1
again, 1
repeated, 1
Villefort., 1
The, 1
invalid's, 1
eye, 1
remained, 1
fixed,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
expression, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
intimate, 1
that, 1
his, 1
resolution, 1
was, 1
unalterable., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
to, 1
do, 1
us, 1
some, 1
ill, 1
turn?, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
it, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
while?", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Still,", 1
said, 1
Barrois,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
freedom, 1
and, 1
fidelity, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
servant,, 1
"if, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
asks, 1
for, 1
a, 1
notary,, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
he, 1
really, 1
wishes, 1
for, 1
a, 1
notary;, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
at, 1
once, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
one.", 1
Barrois, 1
acknowledged, 1
no, 1
master, 1
but, 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
never, 1
allowed, 1
his, 1
desires, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
to, 1
be, 1
contradicted., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
want, 1
a, 1
notary,", 1
motioned, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
shutting, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
defiance,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
dares, 1
to, 1
refuse, 1
my, 1
request.", 1
"You, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
a, 1
notary,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
absolutely, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
one,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
him, 1
your, 1
state, 1
of, 1
health,, 1
and, 1
make, 1
excuses, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
cannot, 1
fail, 1
of, 1
being, 1
a, 1
most, 1
ridiculous, 1
one.", 1
"Never, 1
mind, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Barrois;, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
a, 1
notary,, 1
nevertheless,"--and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
departed, 1
triumphantly, 1
on, 1
his, 1
mission., 1
Chapter, 1
59., 1
The, 1
Will., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
Barrois, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
a, 1
malicious, 1
expression, 1
that, 1
said, 1
many, 1
things., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
perfectly, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
look,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
did, 1
Villefort,, 1
for, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
became, 1
clouded,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
knitted, 1
his, 1
eyebrows, 1
angrily., 1
He, 1
took, 1
a, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
quietly, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
Noirtier, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
seat, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
an, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
perfect, 1
indifference,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
giving, 1
a, 1
side, 1
look, 1
at, 1
Valentine,, 1
which, 1
made, 1
her, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
she, 1
also, 1
was, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Three-quarters, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
after,, 1
Barrois, 1
returned,, 1
bringing, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
with, 1
him., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
first, 1
salutations, 1
were, 1
over,, 1
"you, 1
were, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
by, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
see, 1
here., 1
All, 1
his, 1
limbs, 1
have, 1
become, 1
completely, 1
paralysed,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
lost, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
also,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
ourselves, 1
find, 1
much, 1
trouble, 1
in, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
some, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
his, 1
meaning.", 1
Noirtier, 1
cast, 1
an, 1
appealing, 1
look, 1
on, 1
Valentine,, 1
which, 1
look, 1
was, 1
at, 1
once, 1
so, 1
earnest, 1
and, 1
imperative,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
answered, 1
immediately., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"I, 1
perfectly, 1
understand, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
meaning, 1
at, 1
all, 1
times.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
Barrois;, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
told, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
as, 1
we, 1
walked, 1
along.", 1
"Permit, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
turning, 1
first, 1
to, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
then, 1
to, 1
Valentine--"permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
state, 1
that, 1
the, 1
case, 1
in, 1
question, 1
is, 1
just, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
public, 1
officer, 1
like, 1
myself, 1
cannot, 1
proceed, 1
to, 1
act, 1
without, 1
thereby, 1
incurring, 1
a, 1
dangerous, 1
responsibility., 1
The, 1
first, 1
thing, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
render, 1
an, 1
act, 1
valid, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
should, 1
be, 1
thoroughly, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
faithfully, 1
interpreted, 1
the, 1
will, 1
and, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
person, 1
dictating, 1
the, 1
act., 1
Now, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
approbation, 1
or, 1
disapprobation, 1
of, 1
a, 1
client, 1
who, 1
cannot, 1
speak,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
his, 1
desire, 1
or, 1
his, 1
repugnance, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
clearly, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
his, 1
want, 1
of, 1
speech,, 1
my, 1
services, 1
here, 1
would, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
useless,, 1
and, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
legally, 1
exercised.", 1
The, 1
notary, 1
then, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
retire., 1
An, 1
imperceptible, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
triumph, 1
was, 1
expressed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur., 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
so, 1
full, 1
of, 1
grief,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
arrested, 1
the, 1
departure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"the, 1
language, 1
which, 1
I, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
my, 1
grandfather, 1
may, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
learnt,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
can, 1
teach, 1
you, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes,, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
it, 1
almost, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
I, 1
can, 1
myself., 1
Will, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
require,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
set, 1
your, 1
conscience, 1
quite, 1
at, 1
ease, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject?", 1
"In, 1
order, 1
to, 1
render, 1
an, 1
act, 1
valid,, 1

must, 1
be, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
approbation, 1

disapprobation, 1
of, 1
my, 1
client., 1
Illness, 1
of, 1
body, 1
would, 1
not, 1
affect, 1
the, 1
validity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
deed,, 1

sanity, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
is, 1
absolutely, 1
requisite.", 1
"Well,, 1
sir,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
help, 1
of, 1
two, 1
signs,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
will, 1
acquaint, 1
you, 1
presently,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
ascertain, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
certainty, 1
that, 1
my, 1
grandfather, 1
is, 1
still, 1
in, 1
the, 1
full, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
all, 1
his, 1
mental, 1
faculties., 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
being, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
motion,, 1
is, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
his, 1
meaning, 1
by, 1
closing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
when, 1
he, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
signify, 1
'yes,', 1
and, 1
to, 1
wink, 1
when, 1
he, 1
means, 1
'no.', 1
You, 1
now, 1
know, 1
quite, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
enable, 1
you, 1
to, 1
converse, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Noirtier;--try.", 1
Noirtier, 1
gave, 1
Valentine, 1
such, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
tenderness, 1
and, 1
gratitude, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
comprehended, 1
even, 1
by, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
himself., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
and, 1
understood, 1
what, 1
your, 1
granddaughter, 1
has, 1
been, 1
saying,, 1
sir,, 1
have, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
Noirtier, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
approve, 1
of, 1
what, 1
she, 1
said--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
you, 1
declare, 1
that, 1
the, 1
signs, 1
which, 1
she, 1
mentioned, 1
are, 1
really, 1
those, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
are, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
your, 1
thoughts?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
you, 1
who, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"To, 1
make, 1
your, 1
will?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
go, 1
away, 1
without, 1
fulfilling, 1
your, 1
original, 1
intentions?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
winked, 1
violently., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
your, 1
conscience, 1
perfectly, 1
at, 1
rest, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject?", 1
But, 1
before, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
could, 1
answer,, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
drawn, 1
him, 1
aside., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
can, 1
sustain, 1
a, 1
physical, 1
shock,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
has, 1
received,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
detriment, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mental, 1
faculties?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
exactly, 1
that,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
"which, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
uneasy,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
difficulty, 1
will, 1
be, 1
in, 1
wording, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
and, 1
intentions,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
get, 1
his, 1
answers.", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
see, 1
that, 1
to, 1
be, 1
an, 1
utter, 1
impossibility,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
heard, 1
this, 1
conversation,, 1
and, 1
Noirtier, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
so, 1
earnestly, 1
on, 1
Valentine, 1
that, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
bound, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
to, 1
the, 1
look., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"that, 1
need, 1
not, 1
make, 1
you, 1
uneasy,, 1
however, 1
difficult, 1
it, 1
may, 1
at, 1
first, 1
sight, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
be., 1
I, 1
can, 1
discover, 1
and, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
you, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
thoughts,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
put, 1
an, 1
end, 1
to, 1
all, 1
your, 1
doubts, 1
and, 1
fears, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
I, 1
have, 1
now, 1
been, 1
six, 1
years, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
him, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
if, 1
ever, 1
once,, 1
during, 1
that, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
entertained, 1
a, 1
thought, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
understand.", 1
"No,", 1
signed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
try, 1
what, 1
we, 1
can, 1
do,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"You, 1
accept, 1
this, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
as, 1
your, 1
interpreter,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
sir,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
require, 1
of, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
document, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
drawn, 1
up?", 1
Valentine, 1
named, 1
all, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
alphabet, 1
until, 1
she, 1
came, 1
to, 1
W., 1
At, 1
this, 1
letter, 1
the, 1
eloquent, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
gave, 1
her, 1
notice, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
to, 1
stop., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
W, 1
which, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
wants,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Wait,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
and,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
she, 1
repeated,, 1
"Wa--We--Wi"--The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
stopped, 1
her, 1
at, 1
the, 1
last, 1
syllable., 1
Valentine, 1
then, 1
took, 1
the, 1
dictionary,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
while, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
over, 1
the, 1
pages., 1
She, 1
passed, 1
her, 1
finger, 1
slowly, 1
down, 1
the, 1
columns,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
she, 1
came, 1
to, 1
the, 1
word, 1
"Will,", 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
bade, 1
her, 1
stop., 1
"Will,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
is, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
making, 1
his, 1
will.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,", 1
motioned, 1
the, 1
invalid., 1
"Really,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
allow, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
most, 1
extraordinary,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
astonished, 1
notary,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
think, 1
the, 1
will, 1
promises, 1
to, 1
be, 1
yet, 1
more, 1
extraordinary,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
see, 1
how, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
drawn, 1
up, 1
without, 1
the, 1
intervention, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
may,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
considered, 1
as, 1
too, 1
much, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
its, 1
contents, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
of, 1
her, 1
being, 1
a, 1
suitable, 1
interpreter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
obscure, 1
and, 1
ill-defined, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather.", 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
no,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic., 1
"What?", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
is, 1
not, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
your, 1
will?", 1
"No.", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
whose, 1
interest, 1
had, 1
been, 1
greatly, 1
excited,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
resolved, 1
on, 1
publishing, 1
far, 1
and, 1
wide, 1
the, 1
account, 1
of, 1
this, 1
extraordinary, 1
and, 1
picturesque, 1
scene,, 1
"what, 1
appeared, 1
so, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
me, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
ago,, 1
has, 1
now, 1
become, 1
quite, 1
easy, 1
and, 1
practicable,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
may, 1
be, 1
a, 1
perfectly, 1
valid, 1
will,, 1
provided, 1
it, 1
be, 1
read, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
seven, 1
witnesses,, 1
approved, 1
by, 1
the, 1
testator,, 1
and, 1
sealed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
witnesses., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
time,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
not, 1
require, 1
very, 1
much, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
generality, 1
of, 1
wills., 1
There, 1
are, 1
certain, 1
forms, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
be, 1
gone, 1
through,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
are, 1
always, 1
the, 1
same., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
details,, 1
the, 1
greater, 1
part, 1
will, 1
be, 1
furnished, 1
afterwards, 1
by, 1
the, 1
state, 1
in, 1
which, 1
we, 1
find, 1
the, 1
affairs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
testator,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
yourself,, 1
who,, 1
having, 1
had, 1
the, 1
management, 1
of, 1
them,, 1
can, 1
doubtless, 1
give, 1
full, 1
information, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
But, 1
besides, 1
all, 1
this,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
the, 1
instrument, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
contested,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
give, 1
it, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
possible, 1
authenticity,, 1
therefore,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
colleagues, 1
will, 1
help, 1
me,, 1
and,, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
custom,, 1
will, 1
assist, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dictation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
testament., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
satisfied,, 1
sir?", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Yes,", 1
looked, 1
the, 1
invalid,, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
beaming, 1
with, 1
delight, 1
at, 1
the, 1
ready, 1
interpretation, 1
of, 1
his, 1
meaning., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
he, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
thought, 1
Villefort,, 1
whose, 1
position, 1
demanded, 1
much, 1
reserve,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
was, 1
longing, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
intentions, 1
were., 1
He, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room, 1
to, 1
give, 1
orders, 1
for, 1
another, 1
notary, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sent,, 1
but, 1
Barrois,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
all, 1
that, 1
passed,, 1
had, 1
guessed, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
wishes,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
already, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
one., 1
The, 1
procureur, 1
then, 1
told, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
to, 1
come, 1
up., 1
In, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
every, 1
one, 1
had, 1
assembled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic;, 1
the, 1
second, 1
notary, 1
had, 1
also, 1
arrived., 1
A, 1
few, 1
words, 1
sufficed, 1
for, 1
a, 1
mutual, 1
understanding, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
officers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law., 1
They, 1
read, 1
to, 1
Noirtier, 1
the, 1
formal, 1
copy, 1
of, 1
a, 1
will,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
terms, 1
in, 1
which, 1
such, 1
documents, 1
are, 1
generally, 1
couched;, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
test, 1
the, 1
capacity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
testator,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
notary, 1
said,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
him,--"When, 1
an, 1
individual, 1
makes, 1
his, 1
will,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
in, 1
favor, 1
or, 1
in, 1
prejudice, 1
of, 1
some, 1
person.", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
an, 1
exact, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fortune?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
name, 1
to, 1
you, 1
several, 1
sums, 1
which, 1
will, 1
increase, 1
by, 1
gradation;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
stop, 1
me, 1
when, 1
I, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
one, 1
representing, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
your, 1
own, 1
possessions?", 1
"Yes.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
solemnity, 1
in, 1
this, 1
interrogation., 1
Never, 1
had, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
between, 1
mind, 1
and, 1
matter, 1
been, 1
more, 1
apparent, 1
than, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
sublime,, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
a, 1
curious, 1
spectacle., 1
They, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
circle, 1
round, 1
the, 1
invalid;, 1
the, 1
second, 1
notary, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
at, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
writing,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
colleague, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
before, 1
the, 1
testator, 1
in, 1
the, 1
act, 1
of, 1
interrogating, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
to, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
alluded., 1
"Your, 1
fortune, 1
exceeds, 1
300,000., 1
francs,, 1
does, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
it, 1
did., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
possess, 1
400,000, 1
francs?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
remained, 1
immovable., 1
"Five, 1
hundred, 1
thousand?", 1
The, 1
same, 1
expression, 1
continued., 1
"Six, 1
hundred, 1
thousand--700,000--800,000--900,000?", 1
Noirtier, 1
stopped, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
last-named, 1
sum., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
then, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
900,000., 1
francs?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Yes.", 1
"In, 1
landed, 1
property?", 1
"No.", 1
"In, 1
stock?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"The, 1
stock, 1
is, 1
in, 1
your, 1
own, 1
hands?", 1
The, 1
look, 1
which, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
cast, 1
on, 1
Barrois, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
wanting, 1
which, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
where, 1
to, 1
find., 1
The, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
presently, 1
returned,, 1
bringing, 1
with, 1
him, 1
a, 1
small, 1
casket., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
permit, 1
us, 1
to, 1
open, 1
this, 1
casket?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
Noirtier, 1
gave, 1
his, 1
assent., 1
They, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
900,000., 1
francs, 1
in, 1
bank, 1
scrip., 1
The, 1
first, 1
notary, 1
handed, 1
over, 1
each, 1
note,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
it,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
colleague., 1
The, 1
total, 1
amount, 1
was, 1
found, 1
to, 1
be, 1
as, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
had, 1
stated., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
all, 1
as, 1
he, 1
has, 1
said;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
still, 1
retains, 1
its, 1
full, 1
force, 1
and, 1
vigor.", 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
paralytic,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"You, 1

900,000., 1
francs, 1
of, 1
capital,, 1

according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
invested, 1
it,, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
in, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
about, 1
40,000, 1
livres?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"To, 1
whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
this, 1
fortune?", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
much, 1
doubt, 1
on, 1
that, 1
subject., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
tenderly, 1
loves, 1
his, 1
granddaughter,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
she, 1
who, 1
has, 1
nursed, 1
and, 1
tended, 1
him, 1
for, 1
six, 1
years,, 1
and, 1
has,, 1
by, 1
her, 1
devoted, 1
attention,, 1
fully, 1
secured, 1
the, 1
affection,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
said, 1
the, 1
gratitude,, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
but, 1
just, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
reap, 1
the, 1
fruit, 1
of, 1
her, 1
devotion.", 1
The, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
clearly, 1
showed, 1
by, 1
its, 1
expression, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
deceived, 1
by, 1
the, 1
false, 1
assent, 1
given, 1
by, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
words, 1
and, 1
manner, 1
to, 1
the, 1
motives, 1
which, 1
she, 1
supposed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
entertain., 1
"Is, 1
it,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
that, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
these, 1
900,000, 1
francs?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
thinking, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
insert, 1
this, 1
clause,, 1
but, 1
waiting, 1
first, 1
for, 1
the, 1
assent, 1
of, 1
Noirtier,, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
necessary, 1
should, 1
be, 1
given, 1
before, 1
all, 1
the, 1
witnesses, 1
of, 1
this, 1
singular, 1
scene., 1
Valentine,, 1
when, 1
her, 1
name, 1
was, 1
made, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
discussion,, 1
had, 1
stepped, 1
back,, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
unpleasant, 1
observation;, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
cast, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
was, 1
crying., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
tenderness,, 1
then,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
he, 1
significantly, 1
winked, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
dissent., 1
"What,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
intend, 1
making, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
your, 1
residuary, 1
legatee?", 1
"No.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
not, 1
making, 1
any, 1
mistake,, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary;, 1
"you, 1
really, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
declare, 1
that, 1
such, 1
is, 1
not, 1
your, 1
intention?", 1
"No,", 1
repeated, 1
Noirtier;, 1
"No.", 1
Valentine, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
struck, 1
dumb, 1
with, 1
astonishment., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
disinherited, 1
that, 1
caused, 1
her, 1
grief,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
total, 1
inability, 1
to, 1
account, 1
for, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
which, 1
had, 1
provoked, 1
her, 1
grandfather, 1
to, 1
such, 1
an, 1
act., 1
But, 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
affectionate, 1
tenderness, 1
that, 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"Oh,, 1
grandpapa,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
now, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
deprive, 1
me;, 1
you, 1
still, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
the, 1
love, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
enjoyed.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
most, 1
assuredly,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
them, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
not, 1
mistake., 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
thank, 1
you,", 1
murmured, 1
she., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
declaration, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
destined, 1
inheritor, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
had, 1
excited, 1
the, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
she, 1
gradually, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
invalid,, 1
and, 1
said:, 1
"Then,, 1
doubtless,, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
leaving, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1
your, 1
grandson,, 1
Edward, 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
The, 1
winking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
which, 1
answered, 1
this, 1
speech, 1
was, 1
most, 1
decided, 1
and, 1
terrible,, 1
and, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
almost, 1
amounting, 1
to, 1
hatred., 1
"No?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary;, 1
"then,, 1
perhaps,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
your, 1
son,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
"No.", 1
The, 1
two, 1
notaries, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
in, 1
mute, 1
astonishment, 1
and, 1
inquiry, 1
as, 1
to, 1
what, 1
were, 1
the, 1
real, 1
intentions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
testator., 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
both, 1
grew, 1
red,, 1
one, 1
from, 1
shame,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
from, 1
anger., 1
"What, 1
have, 1
we, 1
all, 1
done,, 1
then,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa?", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"you, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
love, 1
any, 1
of, 1
us?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
passed, 1
rapidly, 1
from, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
and, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
unutterable, 1
fondness., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
love, 1
me,, 1
grandpapa,, 1
try, 1
and, 1
bring, 1
that, 1
love, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
upon, 1
your, 1
actions, 1
at, 1
this, 1
present, 1
moment., 1
You, 1
know, 1
me, 1
well, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fortune;, 1
besides,, 1
they, 1
say, 1
I, 1
am, 1
already, 1
rich, 1
in, 1
right, 1
of, 1
my, 1
mother--too, 1
rich,, 1
even., 1
Explain, 1
yourself,, 1
then.", 1
Noirtier, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
intelligent, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
Valentine's, 1
hand., 1
"My, 1
hand?", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"Yes.", 1
"Her, 1
hand!", 1
exclaimed, 1
every, 1
one., 1
"Oh,, 1
gentlemen,, 1
you, 1
see, 1
it, 1
is, 1
all, 1
useless,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
mind, 1
is, 1
really, 1
impaired,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Ah,", 1
cried, 1
Valentine, 1
suddenly,, 1
"I, 1
understand., 1
It, 1
is, 1
my, 1
marriage, 1
you, 1
mean,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa?", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,", 1
signed, 1
the, 1
paralytic,, 1
casting, 1
on, 1
Valentine, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
joyful, 1
gratitude, 1
for, 1
having, 1
guessed, 1
his, 1
meaning., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
angry, 1
with, 1
us, 1
all, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"Yes?", 1
"Really,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
too, 1
absurd,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
notary;, 1
"on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
evident, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
can, 1
quite, 1
easily, 1
connect, 1
the, 1
train, 1
of, 1
ideas, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind.", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay?", 1
observed, 1
Valentine., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
disinherit, 1
your, 1
granddaughter,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
"because, 1
she, 1
has, 1
contracted, 1
an, 1
engagement, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
your, 1
wishes?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"So, 1
that,, 1
but, 1
for, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
she, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
your, 1
heir?", 1
"Yes.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
silence., 1
The, 1
two, 1
notaries, 1
were, 1
holding, 1
a, 1
consultation, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
best, 1
means, 1
of, 1
proceeding, 1
with, 1
the, 1
affair., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
her, 1
grandfather, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
intense, 1
gratitude,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
biting, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
with, 1
vexation,, 1
while, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
could, 1
not, 1
succeed, 1
in, 1
repressing, 1
an, 1
inward, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
joy,, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
herself,, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
countenance., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
break, 1
the, 1
silence,, 1
"I, 1
consider, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
best, 1
judge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
propriety, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
in, 1
question., 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
only, 1
person, 1
possessing, 1
the, 1
right, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
my, 1
daughter's, 1
hand., 1
It, 1
is, 1
my, 1
wish, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
marry, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay--and, 1
she, 1
shall, 1
marry, 1
him.", 1
Valentine, 1
sank, 1
weeping, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
"how, 1
do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
disposing, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
in, 1
case, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
still, 1
determines, 1
on, 1
marrying, 1
M., 1
Franz?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
gave, 1
no, 1
answer., 1
"You, 1
will,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
it, 1
in, 1
some, 1
way, 1
or, 1
other?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"In, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
some, 1
member, 1
of, 1
your, 1
family?", 1
"No.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
devoting, 1
it, 1
to, 1
charitable, 1
purposes,, 1
then?", 1
pursued, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Yes.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
the, 1
law, 1
does, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
a, 1
son, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entirely, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
his, 1
patrimony?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
only, 1
intend,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
which, 1
the, 1
law, 1
allows, 1
you, 1
to, 1
subtract, 1
from, 1
the, 1
inheritance, 1
of, 1
your, 1
son?", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
no, 1
answer., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
all?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"But, 1
they, 1
will, 1
contest, 1
the, 1
will, 1
after, 1
your, 1
death?", 1
"No.", 1
"My, 1
father, 1
knows, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
his, 1
wishes, 1
will, 1
be, 1
held, 1
sacred, 1
by, 1
me;, 1
besides,, 1
he, 1
understands, 1
that, 1
in, 1
my, 1
position, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
plead, 1
against, 1
the, 1
poor.", 1
The, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
beamed, 1
with, 1
triumph., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
decide, 1
on,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
of, 1
Villefort., 1
"Nothing,, 1
sir;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
resolution, 1
which, 1
my, 1
father, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
and, 1
I, 1
know, 1
he, 1
never, 1
alters, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
resigned., 1
These, 1
900,000, 1
francs, 1
will, 1
go, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
enrich, 1
some, 1
hospital;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
ridiculous, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
the, 1
caprices, 1
of, 1
an, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
shall,, 1
therefore,, 1
act, 1
according, 1
to, 1
my, 1
conscience.", 1
Having, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
Villefort, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
leaving, 1
his, 1
father, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
do, 1
as, 1
he, 1
pleased., 1
The, 1
same, 1
day, 1
the, 1
will, 1
was, 1
made,, 1
the, 1
witnesses, 1
were, 1
brought,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
approved, 1
by, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
sealed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
all, 1
and, 1
given, 1
in, 1
charge, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Deschamps,, 1
the, 1
family, 1
notary., 1
Chapter, 1
60., 1
The, 1
Telegraph., 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
found, 1
on, 1
their, 1
return, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
them, 1
in, 1
their, 1
absence,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
ushered, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
still, 1
awaiting, 1
them, 1
there., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
sufficiently, 1
recovered, 1
from, 1
her, 1
late, 1
emotion, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
of, 1
her, 1
entertaining, 1
visitors, 1
so, 1
immediately,, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bedroom,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
better, 1
depend, 1
upon, 1
himself,, 1
proceeded, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
the, 1
salon., 1
Although, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
flattered, 1
himself, 1
that,, 1
to, 1
all, 1
outward, 1
view,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
completely, 1
masked, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
which, 1
were, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
that, 1
the, 1
cloud, 1
was, 1
still, 1
lowering, 1
on, 1
his, 1

Madame, 1

a, 1

thing.", 1

the, 1
consciousness, 1

The, 1
name, 1
of, 1

sacred, 1

under, 1

as, 1
I, 1
thought;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
politics, 1
which, 1
brought, 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
into, 1
personal, 1
contact., 1
Although, 1
General, 1
d'Epinay, 1
served, 1
under, 1
Napoleon,, 1
did, 1
he, 1
not, 1
still, 1
retain, 1
royalist, 1
sentiments?, 1
And, 1
was, 1
he, 1
not, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
was, 1
assassinated, 1
one, 1
evening, 1
on, 1
leaving, 1
a, 1
Bonapartist, 1
meeting, 1
to, 1

he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
invited, 1
on, 1
the, 1
supposition, 1
that, 1
he, 1
favored, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
emperor?", 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count, 1
almost, 1
with, 1
terror., 1
"Am, 1
I, 1
mistaken,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"No,, 1
sir,, 1
the, 1
facts, 1
were, 1
precisely, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
stated,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
"and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1

renewal, 1
of, 1

d'Epinay.", 1
Villefort, 1
shuddered, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
read, 1
in, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
the, 1
real, 1
feelings, 1
which, 1
had, 1
dictated, 1
the, 1
words, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
uttered., 1

the, 1
count, 1
completely, 1
baffled, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1

prevented, 1
him, 1
from, 1
discovering, 1
anything, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
never-varying, 1
smile, 1
he, 1
was, 1
so, 1
constantly, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
assuming., 1
"Although,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
thing, 1

do, 1
not, 1

will, 1
be, 1
frightened, 1
at, 1

pecuniary, 1
loss., 1

will,, 1
perhaps,, 1
hold, 1
me, 1
in, 1
greater, 1
esteem, 1

how, 1
do, 1
I, 1
know, 1
to, 1
the, 1
contrary?--that, 1
this, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
remained, 1
uninhabited, 1
for, 1
twenty, 1
years,, 1
must, 1
have, 1
some, 1
gloomy, 1
tradition, 1
or, 1
dreadful, 1
legend, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
it.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
come,, 1
count,--I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
eagerly., 1
"Thank, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"now, 1
you, 1
must, 1
permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
take, 1
my, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
said, 1
before, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
us,, 1
monsieur,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
why, 1

your, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
called, 1
to, 1
some, 1
other, 1

"Indeed, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo:, 1
"I, 1
scarcely, 1
know, 1
if, 1
I, 1
dare, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
where, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going.", 1
"Nonsense;, 1
say, 1
on.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
see, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
on, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
sometimes, 1
mused, 1
for, 1
hours, 1
together.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"A, 1
telegraph., 1
So, 1
now, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
my, 1
secret.", 1
"A, 1
telegraph?", 1
repeated, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes,, 1
a, 1
telegraph., 1
I, 1
had, 1
often, 1
seen, 1
one, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
road, 1
on, 1
a, 1
hillock,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
its, 1
black, 1
arms,, 1
bending, 1
in, 1
every, 1
direction,, 1
always, 1
reminded, 1
me, 1
of, 1
the, 1
claws, 1
of, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
beetle,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
it, 1
was, 1
never, 1
without, 1
emotion, 1
that, 1
I, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
it,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
help, 1
thinking, 1
how, 1
wonderful, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
these, 1
various, 1
signs, 1
should, 1
be, 1
made, 1
to, 1
cleave, 1
the, 1
air, 1
with, 1
such, 1
precision, 1
as, 1
to, 1
convey, 1
to, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
leagues, 1
the, 1
ideas, 1
and, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
sitting, 1
at, 1
a, 1
table, 1
at, 1
one, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
line, 1
to, 1
another, 1
man, 1
similarly, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
extremity,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
this, 1
effected, 1
by, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
act, 1
of, 1
volition, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sender, 1
of, 1
the, 1
message., 1
I, 1
began, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
genii,, 1
sylphs,, 1
gnomes,, 1
in, 1
short,, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
ministers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
occult, 1
sciences,, 1
until, 1
I, 1
laughed, 1
aloud, 1
at, 1
the, 1
freaks, 1
of, 1
my, 1
own, 1
imagination., 1
Now,, 1
it, 1
never, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
a, 1
nearer, 1
inspection, 1
of, 1
these, 1
large, 1
insects,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
black, 1
claws,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
always, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
find, 1
under, 1
their, 1
stone, 1
wings, 1
some, 1
little, 1
human, 1
genius, 1
fagged, 1
to, 1
death, 1
with, 1
cabals,, 1
factions,, 1
and, 1
government, 1
intrigues., 1
But, 1
one, 1
fine, 1
day, 1
I, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
the, 1
mover, 1
of, 1
this, 1
telegraph, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
wretch,, 1
hired, 1
for, 1
twelve, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
and, 1
employed, 1
all, 1
day,, 1
not, 1
in, 1
studying, 1
the, 1
heavens, 1
like, 1
an, 1
astronomer,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
gazing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
water, 1
like, 1
an, 1
angler,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
in, 1
enjoying, 1
the, 1
privilege, 1
of, 1
observing, 1
the, 1
country, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
all, 1
his, 1
monotonous, 1
life, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
watching, 1
his, 1
white-bellied,, 1
black-clawed, 1
fellow, 1
insect,, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
leagues, 1
distant, 1
from, 1
him., 1
At, 1
length, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
study, 1
this, 1
living, 1
chrysalis, 1
more, 1
closely,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
part, 1
played, 1
by, 1
these, 1
insect-actors, 1
when, 1
they, 1
occupy, 1
themselves, 1
simply, 1
with, 1
pulling, 1
different, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
string.", 1
"And, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
there?", 1
"I, 1
am.", 1
"What, 1
telegraph, 1
do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
visiting?, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
home, 1
department,, 1
or, 1
of, 1
the, 1
observatory?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
find, 1
there, 1
people, 1
who, 1
would, 1
force, 1
me, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
things, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
would, 1
prefer, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
ignorant,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
would, 1
try, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
myself,, 1

mystery, 1

even, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1

Ma, 1
foi,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
my, 1
illusions, 1
concerning, 1
insects, 1
unimpaired;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
have, 1
those, 1
dissipated, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fellow-creatures., 1
I, 1
shall,, 1
therefore,, 1
not, 1
visit, 1
either, 1
of, 1
these, 1
telegraphs,, 1

one, 1
in, 1
the, 1
open, 1
country, 1

I, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
a, 1
good-natured, 1
simpleton,, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
no, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
machine, 1

is, 1
employed, 1
to, 1
work.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
man,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"What, 1
line, 1
would, 1
you, 1

me, 1
to, 1
study?", 1

looked, 1

with, 1
ivy, 1

studded, 1
with, 1
wall-flowers., 1
No, 1

old,, 1

are, 1
provided, 1
with,--it, 1

also, 1
a, 1

garden, 1
was, 1
crossed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
path, 1
of, 1
red, 1

edged, 1
by, 1
a, 1
border, 1
of, 1

with, 1
a, 1
purer, 1

more, 1
scrupulous, 1
worship, 1

that, 1
which, 1
was, 1
paid, 1
to, 1
her, 1
in, 1
this, 1
little, 1

fact,, 1
of, 1

twenty, 1

bestowed, 1
upon, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
stopped, 1
after, 1
having, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
and, 1
fastened, 1
the, 1
string, 1
to, 1
the, 1
nail,, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
look, 1
around., 1
"The, 1
man, 1
at, 1
the, 1

said, 1
he,, 1
"must, 1
either, 1
engage, 1
a, 1
gardener, 1
or, 1
devote, 1
himself, 1
passionately, 1
to, 1
agriculture.", 1
Suddenly, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
against, 1
something, 1
crouching, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
wheelbarrow, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
leaves;, 1
the, 1
something, 1
rose,, 1
uttering, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
astonishment,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
facing, 1
a, 1
man, 1
about, 1
fifty, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
plucking, 1
strawberries,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
placing, 1
upon, 1
grape, 1
leaves., 1
He, 1
had, 1
twelve, 1
leaves, 1
and, 1
about, 1
as, 1
many, 1
strawberries,, 1
which,, 1
on, 1
rising, 1
suddenly,, 1
he, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
gathering, 1
your, 1
crop,, 1
sir?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
cap;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
up, 1
there,, 1
I, 1
know,, 1

I, 1
have, 1
only, 1
just, 1
come, 1
down.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1

me, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
you, 1
in, 1
anything,, 1

indeed,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
any, 1

"I, 1
have, 1
ten, 1
left,", 1

the, 1
man,, 1
"for, 1
here, 1
are, 1
eleven,, 1

twenty-one,, 1
five, 1
more, 1

I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
surprised;, 1

been, 1
warm, 1
this, 1

strawberries, 1
require, 1
heat,, 1

am, 1
sure, 1

were, 1
here--I, 1

be, 1

has, 1
stolen, 1

saw, 1
him, 1
strolling, 1
about, 1
here, 1
this, 1
morning., 1
Ah,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
rascal--stealing, 1
in, 1
a, 1
garden--he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know, 1
where, 1
that, 1
may, 1
lead, 1
him, 1
to.", 1
"Certainly,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
wrong,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
should, 1
take, 1
into, 1
consideration, 1

greediness, 1
of, 1
the, 1

course,", 1

the, 1
gardener,, 1

that, 1

once, 1
more, 1

pardon;, 1

he, 1
glanced, 1
timidly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
blue, 1
coat., 1
"Calm, 1
yourself,, 1
my, 1

said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
smile, 1

he, 1
made, 1
at, 1
will, 1
either, 1
terrible, 1
or, 1
benevolent,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
now, 1
expressed, 1
only, 1
the, 1
kindliest, 1
feeling;, 1

time, 1
is, 1

contortions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
right-hand, 1
correspondent,, 1

not, 1
understanding, 1
the, 1
change,, 1
began, 1
to, 1

gardener, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
mad., 1
As, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left-hand, 1
one,, 1
he, 1
conscientiously, 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
same, 1
signals,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
finally, 1
transmitted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Minister, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Interior., 1
"Now, 1
you, 1
are, 1
rich,", 1

friend,", 1

wronged, 1
no, 1
man,, 1

on, 1
the, 1
contrary, 1
have, 1
benefited, 1
mankind.", 1
The, 1
man, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bank-notes,, 1
felt, 1
them,, 1
counted, 1
them,, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
then, 1
red,, 1
then, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
his, 1
room, 1
to, 1
drink, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
water,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
water-jug,, 1
and, 1
fainted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dried, 1
herbs., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
the, 1
new, 1
telegram, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
minister,, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
put, 1
to, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
to, 1
Danglars', 1
house., 1
"Has, 1
your, 1
husband, 1
any, 1
Spanish, 1
bonds?", 1
he, 1
asked, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
indeed!, 1
He, 1
has, 1
six, 1
millions', 1
worth.", 1
"He, 1
must, 1
sell, 1
them, 1
at, 1
whatever, 1
price.", 1
"Why?", 1
"Because, 1
Don, 1
Carlos, 1
has, 1
fled, 1
from, 1
Bourges,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Spain.", 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know?", 1
Debray, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"The, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
asking, 1
how, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
news,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
did, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
a, 1
repetition;, 1
she, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
who, 1
immediately, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
his, 1
agent,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
to, 1
sell, 1
at, 1
any, 1
price., 1
When, 1
it, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
sold,, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
funds, 1
fell, 1
directly., 1
Danglars, 1
lost, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
rid, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
all, 1
his, 1
Spanish, 1
shares., 1
The, 1
same, 1
evening, 1
the, 1
following, 1
was, 1
read, 1
in, 1
Le, 1
Messager:, 1

All, 1
that, 1
evening, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
but, 1
the, 1
foresight, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
sold, 1
his, 1
shares,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
the, 1
luck, 1
of, 1

only, 1
lost, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1

Those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
their, 1
shares,, 1
or, 1
bought, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
themselves, 1
as, 1
ruined,, 1
and, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
very, 1
bad, 1
night., 1
Next, 1
morning, 1
Le, 1
Moniteur, 1
contained, 1
the, 1
following:, 1

higher, 1

This,, 1
reckoning, 1
his, 1
loss,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
missed, 1

made, 1

"Good,", 1

Monte, 1

to, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house, 1
when, 1
the, 1

arrived, 1

the, 1
strange, 1

"What, 1

you, 1
discovered?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1

At, 1
first, 1
sight,, 1
the, 1
exterior, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
at, 1
Auteuil, 1
gave, 1
no, 1

nothing, 1
one, 1

expect, 1
from, 1
the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
magnificent, 1
Count, 1
of, 1

this, 1
simplicity, 1
was, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
its, 1
master,, 1
who, 1
positively, 1
ordered, 1
nothing, 1

was, 1

that, 1
morning, 1
laid, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
the, 1
water, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
glistening., 1
For, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
the, 1
orders, 1
had, 1
been, 1
issued, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
given, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
to, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
marking, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
each, 1
tree, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
planted,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
shape, 1
and, 1
extent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lawn, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paving-stones., 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
house, 1
had, 1
become, 1
unrecognizable,, 1
and, 1
Bertuccio, 1
himself, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
scarcely, 1
knew, 1
it,, 1
encircled, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
by, 1
a, 1
framework, 1
of, 1
trees., 1
The, 1
overseer, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
objected,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
it,, 1
to, 1
have, 1
made, 1
some, 1
improvements, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
positively, 1
forbidden, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
touched., 1
Bertuccio, 1
made, 1
amends,, 1
however,, 1
by, 1
loading, 1
the, 1
ante-chambers,, 1
staircases,, 1
and, 1
mantle-pieces, 1
with, 1
flowers., 1
What,, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
manifested, 1
the, 1
shrewdness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
profound, 1
science, 1
of, 1
the, 1
master,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
in, 1
carrying, 1
out, 1
the, 1
ideas, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
was, 1
that, 1
this, 1
house, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
only, 1
the, 1
night, 1
before, 1
so, 1
sad, 1
and, 1
gloomy,, 1
impregnated, 1
with, 1
that, 1
sickly, 1
smell, 1
one, 1
can, 1
almost, 1
fancy, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
had, 1
in, 1
a, 1
single, 1
day, 1
acquired, 1
the, 1
aspect, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
was, 1
scented, 1
with, 1
its, 1
master's, 1
favorite, 1
perfumes,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
the, 1
very, 1
light, 1
regulated, 1
according, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wish., 1
When, 1
the, 1
count, 1
arrived,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
under, 1
his, 1
touch, 1
his, 1
books, 1
and, 1
arms,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
rested, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
favorite, 1
pictures;, 1
his, 1
dogs,, 1
whose, 1
caresses, 1
he, 1
loved,, 1
welcomed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber;, 1
the, 1
birds,, 1
whose, 1
songs, 1
delighted, 1
him,, 1
cheered, 1
him, 1
with, 1
their, 1
music;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
awakened, 1
from, 1
its, 1
long, 1
sleep,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
sleeping, 1
beauty, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wood,, 1
lived,, 1
sang,, 1
and, 1
bloomed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
houses, 1
we, 1
have, 1
long, 1
cherished,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
which,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
are, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
them,, 1
we, 1
leave, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
our, 1
souls., 1
The, 1
servants, 1
passed, 1
gayly, 1
along, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
court-yard;, 1
some,, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
kitchens,, 1
gliding, 1
down, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
restored, 1
but, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
day,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
they, 1
had, 1
always, 1
inhabited, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
others, 1
filling, 1
the, 1
coach-houses,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
equipages,, 1
encased, 1
and, 1
numbered,, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
installed, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fifty, 1
years;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
stables, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
replied, 1
with, 1
neighs, 1
to, 1
the, 1
grooms,, 1
who, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
them, 1
with, 1
much, 1
more, 1
respect, 1
than, 1
many, 1
servants, 1
pay, 1
their, 1
masters., 1
The, 1
library, 1
was, 1
divided, 1
into, 1
two, 1
parts, 1
on, 1
either, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
contained, 1
upwards, 1
of, 1
two, 1
thousand, 1
volumes;, 1
one, 1
division, 1
was, 1
entirely, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
novels,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
the, 1
volume, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
published, 1
but, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
its, 1
place, 1
in, 1
all, 1
the, 1
dignity, 1
of, 1
its, 1
red, 1
and, 1
gold, 1
binding., 1
On, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
to, 1
match, 1
with, 1
the, 1
library,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
conservatory,, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
rare, 1
flowers,, 1
that, 1
bloomed, 1
in, 1
china, 1
jars;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greenhouse,, 1
marvellous, 1
alike, 1
to, 1
sight, 1
and, 1
smell,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
billiard-table, 1
which, 1
looked, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
abandoned, 1
during, 1
the, 1
past, 1
hour, 1
by, 1
players, 1
who, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
balls, 1
on, 1
the, 1
cloth., 1
One, 1
chamber, 1
alone, 1
had, 1
been, 1
respected, 1
by, 1
the, 1
magnificent, 1
Bertuccio., 1
Before, 1
this, 1
room,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
you, 1
could, 1
ascend, 1
by, 1
the, 1
grand,, 1
and, 1
go, 1
out, 1
by, 1
the, 1
back, 1
staircase,, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
passed, 1
with, 1
curiosity,, 1
and, 1
Bertuccio, 1
with, 1
terror., 1
At, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
precisely,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
arrived, 1
before, 1
the, 1
house, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Ali., 1
Bertuccio, 1
was, 1
awaiting, 1
this, 1
arrival, 1
with, 1
impatience,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
uneasiness;, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
for, 1
some, 1
compliments,, 1
while,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
frowns., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
descended, 1
into, 1
the, 1
courtyard,, 1
walked, 1
all, 1
over, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
without, 1
giving, 1
any, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
approbation, 1
or, 1
pleasure,, 1
until, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
bedroom,, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side, 1
to, 1
the, 1
closed, 1
room;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
a, 1
little, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
furniture,, 1
made, 1
of, 1
rosewood,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
at, 1
a, 1
previous, 1
visit., 1
"That, 1
can, 1
only, 1
be, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
gloves,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"Will, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
deign, 1
to, 1
open, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
delighted, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
gloves, 1
in, 1
it.", 1
Elsewhere, 1
the, 1
count, 1
found, 1
everything, 1
he, 1
required--smelling-bottles,, 1
cigars,, 1
knick-knacks., 1
"Good,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio, 1
left, 1
enraptured,, 1
so, 1
great,, 1
so, 1
powerful,, 1
and, 1
real, 1
was, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
exercised, 1
by, 1
this, 1
man, 1
over, 1
all, 1
who, 1
surrounded, 1
him., 1
At, 1
precisely, 1
six, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
clatter, 1
of, 1
horses', 1
hoofs, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
at, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
door;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
our, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
Spahis,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
on, 1
Medeah., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
first,", 1
cried, 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
it, 1
on, 1
purpose, 1
to, 1
have, 1
you, 1
a, 1
minute, 1
to, 1
myself,, 1
before, 1
every, 1
one, 1
came., 1
Julie, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel, 1
have, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
things, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you., 1
Ah,, 1
really, 1
this, 1
is, 1
magnificent!, 1
But, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
count,, 1
will, 1
your, 1
people, 1
take, 1
care, 1
of, 1
my, 1
horse?", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
alarm, 1
yourself,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Maximilian--they, 1
understand.", 1
"I, 1
mean,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
wants, 1
petting., 1
If, 1
you, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
what, 1
a, 1
pace, 1
he, 1
came--like, 1
the, 1
wind!", 1
"I, 1
should, 1
think, 1
so,--a, 1
horse, 1
that, 1
cost, 1
5,000, 1
francs!", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
a, 1
father, 1
would, 1
use, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
son., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
regret, 1
them?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
open, 1
laugh., 1
"I?, 1
Certainly, 1
not,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
only, 1
regret, 1
if, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
had, 1
not, 1
proved, 1
good.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
so, 1
good,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
distanced, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
riders, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
both, 1
mount, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
Arabians;, 1
and, 1
close, 1
on, 1
their, 1
heels, 1
are, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
always, 1
go, 1
at, 1
six, 1
leagues, 1
an, 1
hour.", 1
"Then, 1
they, 1
follow, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"See,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
here.", 1
And, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
minute, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
smoking, 1
horses,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
two, 1
mounted, 1
gentlemen,, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
which, 1
opened, 1
before, 1
them., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
drove, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
horsemen., 1
The, 1
instant, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
carriage-door., 1
He, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
who,, 1
descending,, 1
took, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
peculiarity, 1
of, 1
manner, 1
imperceptible, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one, 1
but, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
But, 1
nothing, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
notice,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
observed, 1
a, 1
little, 1
note,, 1
passed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
facility, 1
that, 1
indicates, 1
frequent, 1
practice,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
secretary., 1
After, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
descended,, 1
as, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
issued, 1
from, 1
his, 1
tomb, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carriage., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
and, 1
inquiring, 1
glance, 1
which, 1
could, 1
only, 1
be, 1
interpreted, 1
by, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
around, 1
the, 1
court-yard,, 1
over, 1
the, 1
peristyle,, 1
and, 1
across, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
then,, 1
repressing, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
emotion,, 1
which, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
if, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
kept, 1
her, 1
color,, 1
she, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
"Sir,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
if, 1
you, 1
would, 1
sell, 1
your, 1
horse.", 1
Morrel, 1
smiled, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
very, 1
like, 1
a, 1
grimace,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
him, 1
to, 1
extricate, 1
him, 1
from, 1
his, 1
embarrassment., 1
The, 1
count, 1
understood, 1
him., 1
"Ah,, 1
madame,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
make, 1
that, 1
request, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
"With, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"one, 1
can, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
nothing,, 1
one, 1
is, 1
so, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
it., 1
If, 1
it, 1
were, 1
so, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel"--, 1
"Unfortunately,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
witness, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
cannot, 1
give, 1
up, 1
his, 1
horse,, 1
his, 1
honor, 1
being, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
keeping, 1
it.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"He, 1
laid, 1
a, 1
wager, 1
he, 1
would, 1
tame, 1
Medeah, 1
in, 1
the, 1
space, 1
of, 1
six, 1
months., 1
You, 1
understand, 1
now, 1
that, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
to, 1
get, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
animal, 1
before, 1
the, 1
time, 1
named,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
only, 1
lose, 1
his, 1
bet,, 1
but, 1
people, 1
would, 1
say, 1
he, 1
was, 1
afraid;, 1
and, 1
a, 1
brave, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
Spahis, 1
cannot, 1
risk, 1
this,, 1
even, 1
to, 1
gratify, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
woman,, 1
which, 1
is,, 1
in, 1
my, 1
opinion,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
sacred, 1
obligations, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"You, 1
see, 1
my, 1
position,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
bestowing, 1
a, 1
grateful, 1
smile, 1
on, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"It, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
coarse, 1
tone,, 1
ill-concealed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
forced, 1
smile,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
already, 1
got, 1
horses, 1
enough.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
seldom, 1
allowed, 1
remarks, 1
of, 1
this, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
unnoticed,, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surprise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
people,, 1
she, 1
pretended, 1
not, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
nothing., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
smiled, 1
at, 1
her, 1
unusual, 1
humility,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
her, 1
two, 1
immense, 1
porcelain, 1
jars,, 1
over, 1
which, 1
wound, 1
marine, 1
plants,, 1
of, 1

The, 1
baroness, 1
was, 1
astonished., 1
"Why,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"you, 1
could, 1
plant, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chestnut-trees, 1

How, 1
can, 1

"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
only, 1
heard, 1
that, 1
an, 1
emperor, 1
of, 1
China, 1
had, 1
an, 1
oven, 1
built, 1
expressly,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
in, 1
this, 1
oven, 1
twelve, 1
jars, 1
like, 1
this, 1
were, 1
successively, 1
baked., 1
Two, 1
broke,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fire;, 1

other, 1
ten, 1
were, 1
sunk, 1
three, 1
hundred, 1
fathoms, 1
deep, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
The, 1
sea,, 1
knowing, 1
what, 1
was, 1
required, 1
of, 1
her,, 1
threw, 1
over, 1
them, 1
her, 1
weeds,, 1
encircled, 1
them, 1
with, 1
coral,, 1
and, 1
encrusted, 1
them, 1
with, 1
shells;, 1
the, 1

two, 1
hundred, 1
years, 1

almost, 1
impervious, 1
depths,, 1

a, 1
revolution, 1

away, 1
the, 1
emperor, 1
who, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
trial,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
left, 1
the, 1
documents, 1
proving, 1
the, 1
manufacture, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jars, 1

the, 1

Meanwhile,, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
cared, 1
little, 1
for, 1
curiosities,, 1
was, 1
mechanically, 1
tearing, 1
off, 1
the, 1
blossoms, 1
of, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
orange-tree,, 1
one, 1
after, 1
another., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
with, 1
the, 1
orange-tree,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
at, 1
the, 1
cactus;, 1
but, 1
this,, 1
not, 1
being, 1
so, 1
easily, 1
plucked, 1
as, 1
the, 1
orange-tree,, 1
pricked, 1
him, 1
dreadfully., 1
He, 1
shuddered,, 1
and, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
as, 1
though, 1
awaking, 1
from, 1
a, 1

"Sir,", 1

"Why?", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"You, 1
pretend, 1
not, 1
to, 1

enough,, 1

Danglars., 1

Danglars,, 1
shrugging, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
which,, 1
at, 1
any, 1
other, 1
time,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
indicated, 1
a, 1
storm,, 1

for, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
she, 1
controlled, 1
herself., 1
"The, 1
baron, 1
appears, 1
thoughtful, 1
to-day,", 1

to, 1
her;, 1

"Not, 1

"M., 1

Baptistin., 1

entered., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
self-control,, 1
was, 1
visibly, 1
affected,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
touched, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
it, 1
tremble., 1
"Certainly,, 1

know, 1
how, 1
to, 1
dissimulate,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
glancing, 1
at, 1

Danglars,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
smiling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
and, 1
embracing, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
After, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
saw, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
who,, 1
until, 1
then,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
occupied, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1

went, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"What, 1

you, 1
want,, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio?", 1

"Is, 1
every, 1
one, 1
here,, 1

"Yes.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
glanced, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door,, 1

was, 1
ajar., 1
The, 1
count, 1
watched, 1
him., 1
"Good, 1

he, 1
exclaimed., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
said, 1
the, 1

"That, 1

woman!", 1
"Which?", 1

his, 1
eyes, 1
starting, 1

his, 1
hair, 1
on, 1

"Waiting, 1
for, 1

Bertuccio,, 1
without, 1
answering,, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
Villefort, 1
with, 1
something, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gesture, 1
Macbeth, 1
uses, 1
to, 1
point, 1
out, 1
Banquo., 1
"Oh,, 1
oh,", 1

at, 1
length, 1

"What?, 1
Who?", 1
"Him!", 1
"Him!--M., 1

him?", 1
"Really,, 1

mad,, 1
good, 1

is, 1
not, 1
dead?", 1
"No;, 1

Bertuccio,, 1
leaning, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
dining-room., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
were, 1
thrown, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
Bertuccio, 1
appearing, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort,, 1
"The, 1
dinner, 1
waits.", 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
conduct, 1
the, 1
Baroness, 1
Danglars?", 1
Villefort, 1
complied,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dining-room., 1
Chapter, 1
63., 1
The, 1
Dinner., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
one, 1
sentiment, 1
affected, 1
all, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
on, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
dining-room., 1
Each, 1
one, 1
asked, 1
what, 1
strange, 1
influence, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
to, 1
this, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
astonished,, 1
even, 1
uneasy, 1
though, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
they, 1
still, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1
be, 1
absent., 1
The, 1
recent, 1
events,, 1
the, 1
solitary, 1
and, 1
eccentric, 1
position, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
his, 1
enormous,, 1
nay,, 1
almost, 1
incredible, 1
fortune,, 1
should, 1
have, 1
made, 1
men, 1
cautious,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
altogether, 1
prevented, 1
ladies, 1
visiting, 1
a, 1
house, 1
where, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
one, 1
of, 1
their, 1
own, 1
sex, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
them;, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
curiosity, 1
had, 1
been, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
them, 1
to, 1
overleap, 1
the, 1
bounds, 1
of, 1
prudence, 1
and, 1
decorum., 1
And, 1
all, 1
present,, 1
even, 1
including, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
stiffness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
one, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carelessness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
were, 1
thoughtful,, 1
on, 1
finding, 1
themselves, 1
assembled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
this, 1
incomprehensible, 1
man., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
started, 1
when, 1
Villefort,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
invitation,, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm;, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
his, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
uneasy, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
gold, 1
spectacles,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
press, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
own., 1
None, 1
of, 1
this, 1
had, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
by, 1
this, 1
mere, 1
contact, 1
of, 1
individuals, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
had, 1
already, 1
acquired, 1
considerable, 1
interest, 1
for, 1
an, 1
observer., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
left, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
between, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Danglars;, 1
the, 1
other, 1
seats, 1
were, 1
filled, 1
by, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
seated, 1
between, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
repast, 1
was, 1
magnificent;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
endeavored, 1
completely, 1
to, 1
overturn, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
ideas,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
feed, 1
the, 1
curiosity, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
the, 1
appetite, 1
of, 1
his, 1
guests., 1
It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
Oriental, 1
feast, 1
that, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
but, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Arabian, 1
fairies, 1
might, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
prepare., 1
Every, 1
delicious, 1
fruit, 1
that, 1
the, 1
four, 1
quarters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
globe, 1
could, 1
provide, 1
was, 1
heaped, 1
in, 1
vases, 1
from, 1
China, 1
and, 1
jars, 1
from, 1
Japan., 1
Rare, 1
birds,, 1
retaining, 1
their, 1
most, 1
brilliant, 1
plumage,, 1
enormous, 1
fish,, 1
spread, 1
upon, 1
massive, 1
silver, 1
dishes,, 1
together, 1
with, 1
every, 1
wine, 1
produced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Archipelago,, 1
Asia, 1
Minor,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
Cape,, 1
sparkling, 1
in, 1
bottles,, 1
whose, 1
grotesque, 1
shape, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
give, 1
an, 1
additional, 1
flavor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
draught,--all, 1
these,, 1
like, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
displays, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Apicius, 1
of, 1
old, 1
gratified, 1
his, 1
guests,, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
review, 1
before, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
astonished, 1
Parisians,, 1
who, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
expend, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
louis, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
dinner, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
persons,, 1
but, 1
only, 1
on, 1
the, 1
condition, 1
of, 1
eating, 1
pearls,, 1
like, 1
Cleopatra,, 1
or, 1
drinking, 1
refined, 1
gold,, 1
like, 1
Lorenzo, 1
de', 1
Medici., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
general, 1
astonishment,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
laughing, 1
and, 1
joking, 1
about, 1
it., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
admit, 1
that,, 1
when, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
fortune,, 1
the, 1
superfluities, 1
of, 1
life, 1
are, 1
all, 1
that, 1
can, 1
be, 1
desired;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
that,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
risen, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
eminence, 1
of, 1
position,, 1
the, 1
ideal, 1
alone, 1
can, 1
be, 1
more, 1
exalted., 1
Now,, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
out, 1
this, 1
reasoning,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
marvellous?--that, 1
which, 1
we, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand., 1
What, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
we, 1
really, 1
desire?--that, 1
which, 1
we, 1
cannot, 1
obtain., 1
Now,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
things, 1
which, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
understand,, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
impossibilities,, 1
these, 1
are, 1
the, 1
study, 1
of, 1
my, 1
life., 1
I, 1
gratify, 1
my, 1
wishes, 1
by, 1
two, 1
means--my, 1
will, 1
and, 1
my, 1
money., 1
I, 1
take, 1
as, 1
much, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pursuit, 1
of, 1
some, 1
whim, 1
as, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
promoting, 1
a, 1
new, 1
railway, 1
line;, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
condemning, 1
a, 1
culprit, 1
to, 1
death;, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
in, 1
pacifying, 1
a, 1
kingdom;, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
in, 1
pleasing, 1
a, 1
woman;, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
Morrel,, 1
in, 1
breaking, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
can, 1
ride., 1
For, 1
example,, 1
you, 1
see, 1
these, 1
two, 1
fish;, 1
one, 1
brought, 1
from, 1
fifty, 1
leagues, 1
beyond, 1
St., 1
Petersburg,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
five, 1
leagues, 1
from, 1
Naples., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
amusing, 1
to, 1
see, 1
them, 1
both, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
table?", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
the, 1
two, 1
fish?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
"M., 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
Russia,, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
Major, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
an, 1
Italian,, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other.", 1
"This, 1
one, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
a, 1
sterlet,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"And, 1
that, 1
one,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
mistake, 1
not,, 1
a, 1
lamprey.", 1
"Just, 1
so., 1
Now,, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
ask, 1
these, 1
gentlemen, 1
where, 1
they, 1
are, 1
caught.", 1
"Sterlets,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"are, 1
only, 1
found, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Volga.", 1
"And,", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
Lake, 1
Fusaro, 1
alone, 1
supplies, 1
lampreys, 1
of, 1
that, 1
size.", 1
"Exactly;, 1
one, 1
comes, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Volga,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
from, 1
Lake, 1
Fusaro.", 1
"Impossible!", 1
cried, 1
all, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
simultaneously., 1
"Well,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
just, 1
what, 1
amuses, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
like, 1
Nero--cupitor, 1
impossibilium;, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
what, 1
is, 1
amusing, 1
you, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment., 1
This, 1
fish,, 1
which, 1
seems, 1
so, 1
exquisite, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
is, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
no, 1
better, 1
than, 1
perch, 1
or, 1
salmon;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
here, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"But, 1
how, 1
could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
these, 1
fish, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
France?", 1
"Oh,, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
easy., 1
Each, 1
fish, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
over, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cask--one, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
river, 1
herbs, 1
and, 1
weeds,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
rushes, 1
and, 1
lake, 1
plants;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
wagon, 1
built, 1
on, 1
purpose,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
the, 1
sterlet, 1
lived, 1
twelve, 1
days,, 1
the, 1
lamprey, 1
eight,, 1
and, 1
both, 1
were, 1
alive, 1
when, 1
my, 1
cook, 1
seized, 1
them,, 1
killing, 1
one, 1
with, 1
milk, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
wine., 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
me,, 1
M., 1
Danglars!", 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
doubting,", 1
answered, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
his, 1
stupid, 1
smile., 1
"Baptistin,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"have, 1
the, 1
other, 1
fish, 1
brought, 1
in--the, 1
sterlet, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lamprey, 1
which, 1
came, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other, 1
casks,, 1

which, 1
are, 1
yet, 1
alive.", 1
Danglars, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
bewildered, 1
eyes;, 1
the, 1
company, 1
clapped, 1
their, 1
hands., 1
Four, 1
servants, 1
carried, 1
in, 1
two, 1
casks, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
aquatic, 1
plants,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
each, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
breathing, 1
a, 1
fish, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
those, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"But, 1
why, 1
have, 1
two, 1
of, 1
each, 1
sort?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
"Merely, 1
because, 1
one, 1
might, 1
have, 1
died,", 1
carelessly, 1
answered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
certainly, 1
an, 1
extraordinary, 1
man,", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
"and, 1
philosophers, 1
may, 1
well, 1
say, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
rich.", 1
"And, 1
to, 1

ideas,", 1
added, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
give, 1
me, 1
credit, 1
for, 1
this,, 1
madame;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
done, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Romans,, 1
who, 1
much, 1
esteemed, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
Pliny, 1
relates, 1
that, 1
they, 1
sent, 1
slaves, 1
from, 1
Ostia, 1
to, 1
Rome,, 1
who, 1
carried, 1
on, 1
their, 1
heads, 1
fish, 1
which, 1
he, 1
calls, 1
the, 1
mulus,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
description,, 1
must, 1
probably, 1
be, 1
the, 1

was, 1
also, 1

luxury, 1

part, 1
of, 1

merit--if, 1
they, 1
were, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
alive,, 1

were, 1
despised, 1

dead.", 1
"Yes,", 1

only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
leagues, 1
from, 1
Rome.", 1
"True,", 1

"Yes,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
preferred, 1
having, 1
an, 1

extraordinary!", 1

Chateau-Renaud,, 1

seems, 1

a, 1
new, 1

an, 1
old, 1
one;, 1

at, 1

to, 1

it?", 1
"It, 1
appears, 1
so,", 1

it, 1
possible, 1
that, 1
you, 1

is, 1

ten, 1
years, 1

a, 1
short, 1
time, 1

*, 1
Elisabeth, 1
de, 1
Rossan,, 1

court, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1

where, 1
she, 1
was, 1
known, 1
as, 1
"La, 1
Belle, 1
Provencale.", 1

was, 1
the, 1

of, 1

misfortune, 1
to, 1
excite, 1

enmity, 1
of, 1
her, 1

brothers-in-law,, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
by, 1
them, 1
to, 1
take, 1
poison;, 1

they, 1
finished, 1
her, 1
off, 1
with, 1
pistol, 1
and, 1
dagger.--Ed., 1
"We, 1
must, 1
go,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
offering, 1
his, 1
arm., 1
The, 1
others,, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
curiosity,, 1
were, 1
already, 1
scattered, 1
in, 1
different, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
for, 1
they, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
limited, 1
to, 1
the, 1
one, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
that,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
they, 1
would, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
view, 1
of, 1

rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
building,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
created, 1
a, 1
palace., 1
Each, 1
one, 1
went, 1
out, 1
by, 1
the, 1
open, 1
doors., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
the, 1
two, 1
who, 1
remained;, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
had, 1
passed,, 1
he, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
the, 1
rear,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
his, 1
face, 1
was, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
which,, 1
if, 1
they, 1
could, 1
have, 1
understood, 1
it,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
alarmed, 1
them, 1
much, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
room, 1
they, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
They, 1
began, 1
by, 1
walking, 1
through, 1
the, 1
apartments,, 1
many, 1
of, 1
which, 1
were, 1
fitted, 1
up, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Eastern, 1
style,, 1
with, 1
cushions, 1
and, 1
divans, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
beds,, 1
and, 1
pipes, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
furniture., 1
The, 1
drawing-rooms, 1
were, 1
decorated, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rarest, 1
pictures, 1
by, 1
the, 1
old, 1
masters,, 1
the, 1
boudoirs, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
draperies, 1
from, 1
China,, 1
of, 1
fanciful, 1
colors,, 1
fantastic, 1
design,, 1
and, 1
wonderful, 1
texture., 1
At, 1
length, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
room., 1
There, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
particular, 1
about, 1
it,, 1
excepting, 1
that,, 1
although, 1
daylight, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
lighted,, 1
and, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
it, 1
was, 1
old-fashioned,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
had, 1
been, 1
redecorated., 1
These, 1
two, 1
causes, 1
were, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
give, 1
it, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
aspect., 1
"Oh.", 1
cried, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
really, 1
frightful.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words,, 1
but, 1
was, 1
not, 1
heard., 1
Many, 1
observations, 1
were, 1
made,, 1
the, 1
import, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
a, 1
unanimous, 1
opinion, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
sinister, 1
about, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
so?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Look, 1
at, 1
that, 1
large, 1
clumsy, 1
bed,, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
such, 1
gloomy,, 1
blood-colored, 1
drapery!, 1
And, 1
those, 1
two, 1
crayon, 1
portraits,, 1
that, 1
have, 1
faded, 1
from, 1
the, 1
dampness;, 1
do, 1
they, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
with, 1
their, 1
pale, 1
lips, 1
and, 1
staring, 1
eyes,, 1
'We, 1
have, 1
seen'?", 1
Villefort, 1
became, 1
livid;, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
long, 1
seat, 1
placed, 1
near, 1
the, 1
chimney., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
smiling,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
courageous, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
very, 1
seat, 1
perhaps, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
was, 1
committed?", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
rose, 1
suddenly., 1
"And, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
all.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
there, 1
more?", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
failed, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
agitation, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Ah,, 1
what, 1
else, 1
is, 1
there?", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
"for,, 1
at, 1
present,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
anything, 1
extraordinary., 1
What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
at, 1
Pisa,, 1
Ugolino's, 1
tower;, 1
at, 1
Ferrara,, 1

at, 1

and, 1
Paolo.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
this, 1
little, 1
staircase,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
opening, 1
a, 1
door, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
drapery., 1
"Look, 1
at, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"What, 1
a, 1
wicked-looking,, 1
crooked, 1
staircase,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
wine, 1
of, 1
Chios, 1
produces, 1
melancholy,, 1
but, 1
certainly, 1
everything, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
me, 1
black, 1
in, 1
this, 1
house,", 1
said, 1
Debray., 1
Ever, 1
since, 1
Valentine's, 1
dowry, 1
had, 1
been, 1
mentioned,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
been, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
sad., 1
"Can, 1
you, 1
imagine,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"some, 1
Othello, 1

Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
half, 1
fainted, 1
on, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1

to, 1
support, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
"Ah,, 1

cried, 1
Debray,, 1

with, 1
you?, 1
how, 1

is, 1
very, 1
evident, 1

"really,, 1
count,, 1

"What, 1
is, 1

asked, 1
Debray,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
whisper,, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Nothing,", 1
she, 1
replied, 1
with, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort., 1

that, 1
mysterious, 1
staircase,, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
through, 1
which,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
disturb, 1
their, 1
sleep,, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
nurse, 1
pass,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
the, 1
father, 1
carrying, 1
the, 1
sleeping, 1
child?", 1
Here, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
being, 1
calmed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
soft, 1
picture,, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
groan, 1
and, 1
fainted., 1
"Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
ill,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
better, 1
to, 1
take, 1
her, 1
to, 1
her, 1
carriage.", 1
"Oh,, 1
mon, 1
Dieu,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
forgotten, 1
my, 1
smelling-bottle!", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
mine,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
and, 1
she, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
full, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
red, 1
liquid, 1
whose, 1
good, 1
properties, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
tested, 1
on, 1
Edward., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
taking, 1
it, 1
from, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
"Yes,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"at, 1
your, 1
advice, 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
the, 1
trial.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
succeeded?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
carried, 1
into, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
dropped, 1
a, 1
very, 1
small, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
red, 1
liquid, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
lips;, 1
she, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
consciousness., 1
"Ah,", 1
she, 1
cried,, 1
"what, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
dream!", 1
Villefort, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
let, 1
her, 1
know, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
They, 1
looked, 1
for, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
especially, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
poetical, 1
ideas,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
talking, 1
with, 1
Major, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
on, 1
the, 1
projected, 1
railway, 1
from, 1
Leghorn, 1
to, 1
Florence., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
seemed, 1
in, 1
despair., 1
He, 1
took, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
conducted, 1
her, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
where, 1
they, 1
found, 1
Danglars, 1
taking, 1
coffee, 1
between, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
"Really,, 1
madame,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"did, 1
I, 1
alarm, 1
you, 1
much?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
sir,", 1
she, 1
answered;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
things, 1
impress, 1
us, 1
differently,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
mood, 1
of, 1
our, 1
minds.", 1
Villefort, 1
forced, 1
a, 1
laugh., 1
"And, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
know,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"an, 1
idea,, 1
a, 1
supposition,, 1
is, 1
sufficient.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"you, 1
may, 1
believe, 1
me, 1
if, 1
you, 1
like,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
my, 1
opinion, 1
that, 1
a, 1
crime, 1
has, 1
been, 1
committed, 1
in, 1
this, 1
house.", 1
"Take, 1
care,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"the, 1
king's, 1
attorney, 1
is, 1
here.", 1
"Ah,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"since, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
to, 1
make, 1
my, 1
declaration.", 1
"Your, 1
declaration?", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Yes,, 1
before, 1
witnesses.", 1
"Oh,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
very, 1
interesting,", 1
said, 1
Debray;, 1
"if, 1
there, 1
really, 1
has, 1
been, 1
a, 1
crime,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
investigate, 1
it.", 1
"There, 1
has, 1
been, 1
a, 1
crime,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Come, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
gentlemen;, 1
come,, 1
M., 1
Villefort,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
declaration, 1
to, 1
be, 1
available,, 1
should, 1
be, 1
made, 1
before, 1
the, 1
competent, 1
authorities.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
Villefort's, 1
arm,, 1
and,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
holding, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
under, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
to, 1
the, 1
plantain-tree,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
was, 1
thickest., 1
All, 1
the, 1
other, 1
guests, 1
followed., 1
"Stay,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"here,, 1
in, 1
this, 1
very, 1
spot", 1
(and, 1
he, 1
stamped, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
ground),, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
dug, 1
up, 1
and, 1
fresh, 1
mould, 1
put, 1
in,, 1
to, 1
refresh, 1
these, 1
old, 1
trees;, 1
well,, 1
my, 1
man,, 1
digging,, 1
found, 1
a, 1
box,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
the, 1
iron-work, 1
of, 1
a, 1
box,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
skeleton, 1
of, 1
a, 1
newly, 1
born, 1
infant.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
stiffen,, 1
while, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Villefort, 1
trembled., 1
"A, 1
newly, 1
born, 1
infant,", 1
repeated, 1
Debray;, 1
"this, 1
affair, 1
becomes, 1
serious!", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
wrong, 1
just, 1
now, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
said, 1
that, 1
houses, 1
had, 1
souls, 1
and, 1
faces, 1
like, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
their, 1
exteriors, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
impress, 1
of, 1
their, 1
characters., 1
This, 1
house, 1
was, 1
gloomy, 1
because, 1
it, 1
was, 1
remorseful:, 1
it, 1
was, 1
remorseful, 1
because, 1
it, 1
concealed, 1
a, 1
crime.", 1
"Who, 1
said, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
crime?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
last, 1
effort., 1
"How?, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
a, 1
crime, 1
to, 1
bury, 1
a, 1
living, 1
child, 1
in, 1
a, 1
garden?", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"And, 1
pray, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
call, 1
such, 1
an, 1
action?", 1
"But, 1
who, 1
said, 1
it, 1
was, 1
buried, 1
alive?", 1
"Why, 1
bury, 1
it, 1
there, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
dead?, 1
This, 1
garden, 1
has, 1
never, 1
been, 1
a, 1
cemetery.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
done, 1
to, 1
infanticides, 1
in, 1
this, 1
country?", 1
asked, 1
Major, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
innocently., 1
"Oh,, 1
their, 1
heads, 1
are, 1
soon, 1
cut, 1
off,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so;, 1
am, 1
I, 1
not, 1
right,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Yes,, 1
count,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
now, 1
scarcely, 1
human., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
prepared, 1
this, 1
scene, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
endure, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
it, 1
too, 1
far,, 1
said,, 1
"Come,, 1
gentlemen,--some, 1
coffee,, 1
we, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
have, 1
forgotten, 1
it,", 1
and, 1
he, 1
conducted, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
table, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lawn., 1
"Indeed,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
ashamed, 1
to, 1
own, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
all, 1
your, 1
frightful, 1
stories, 1
have, 1
so, 1
upset, 1
me,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
must, 1
beg, 1
you, 1
to, 1
let, 1
me, 1
sit, 1
down;", 1
and, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
bowed,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
again, 1
requires, 1
your, 1
bottle,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
But, 1
before, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
could, 1
reach, 1
her, 1
friend, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
had, 1
found, 1
time, 1
to, 1
whisper, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"When?", 1
"To-morrow.", 1
"Where?", 1
"In, 1
my, 1
office,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
like,--that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
surest, 1
place.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
there."--At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
approached., 1
"Thanks,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
smile;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
over, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
much, 1
better.", 1
Chapter, 1
64., 1
The, 1
Beggar., 1
The, 1
evening, 1
passed, 1
on;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
which, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
not, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
uneasiness, 1
she, 1
experienced., 1
On, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
request,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
give, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
of, 1
departure., 1
He, 1
offered, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
in, 1
his, 1
landau, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
might, 1
be, 1
under, 1
the, 1
care, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
As, 1
for, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
an, 1
interesting, 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
he, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
anything, 1
that, 1
was, 1
passing., 1
While, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
begged, 1
the, 1
smelling-bottle, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
guessed, 1
all, 1
that, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
between, 1
them,, 1
though, 1
the, 1
words, 1
had, 1
been, 1
uttered, 1
in, 1
so, 1
low, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
as, 1
hardly, 1
to, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
Without, 1
opposing, 1
their, 1
arrangements,, 1
he, 1
allowed, 1
Morrel,, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
and, 1
Debray, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
in, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
carriage., 1
Danglars,, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
delighted, 1
with, 1
Major, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
had, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
found, 1
his, 1
tilbury, 1
waiting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
the, 1
groom,, 1
in, 1
every, 1
respect, 1
a, 1
caricature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English, 1
fashion,, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
on, 1
tiptoe, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
a, 1
large, 1
iron-gray, 1
horse., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
very, 1
little, 1
during, 1
dinner;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
an, 1
intelligent, 1
lad,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
some, 1
absurdity, 1
before, 1
so, 1
many, 1
grand, 1
people,, 1
amongst, 1
whom,, 1
with, 1
dilating, 1
eyes,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
seized, 1
upon, 1
by, 1
Danglars,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
stiff-necked, 1
old, 1
major, 1
and, 1
his, 1
modest, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
into, 1
consideration, 1
the, 1
hospitality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
made, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
society, 1
of, 1
some, 1
nabob, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Paris, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
the, 1
worldly, 1
education, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heir., 1
He, 1
contemplated, 1
with, 1
unspeakable, 1
delight, 1
the, 1
large, 1
diamond, 1
which, 1
shone, 1
on, 1
the, 1
major's, 1
little, 1
finger;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
major,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
prudent, 1
man,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
any, 1
accident, 1
happening, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bank-notes,, 1
had, 1
immediately, 1
converted, 1
them, 1
into, 1
an, 1
available, 1
asset., 1
Then,, 1
after, 1
dinner,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pretext, 1
of, 1
business,, 1
he, 1
questioned, 1
the, 1
father, 1
and, 1
son, 1
upon, 1
their, 1
mode, 1
of, 1
living;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
father, 1
and, 1
son,, 1
previously, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
through, 1
Danglars, 1
the, 1
one, 1
was, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
his, 1
48,000, 1
francs, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
50,000, 1
livres, 1
annually,, 1
were, 1
so, 1
full, 1
of, 1
affability, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
shaken, 1
hands, 1
even, 1
with, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
servants,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
did, 1
their, 1
gratitude, 1
need, 1
an, 1
object, 1
to, 1
expend, 1
itself, 1
upon., 1
One, 1
thing, 1
above, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
heightened, 1
the, 1
respect,, 1
nay, 1
almost, 1
the, 1
veneration,, 1
of, 1
Danglars, 1
for, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
The, 1
latter,, 1
faithful, 1
to, 1
the, 1
principle, 1
of, 1
Horace,, 1
nil, 1
admirari,, 1
had, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
showing, 1
his, 1
knowledge, 1
by, 1
declaring, 1
in, 1
what, 1
lake, 1
the, 1
best, 1
lampreys, 1
were, 1
caught., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
eaten, 1
some, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word, 1
more;, 1
Danglars,, 1
therefore,, 1
concluded, 1
that, 1
such, 1
luxuries, 1
were, 1
common, 1
at, 1
the, 1
table, 1
of, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
descendant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
who, 1
most, 1
likely, 1
in, 1
Lucca, 1
fed, 1
upon, 1
trout, 1
brought, 1
from, 1
Switzerland,, 1
and, 1
lobsters, 1
sent, 1
from, 1
England,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
same, 1
means, 1
used, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
lampreys, 1
from, 1
Lake, 1
Fusaro,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sterlet, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Volga., 1
Thus, 1
it, 1
was, 1
with, 1
much, 1
politeness, 1
of, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
pronounce, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
"To-morrow,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
waiting, 1
upon, 1
you, 1
on, 1
business.", 1
"And, 1
I,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"shall, 1
be, 1
most, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
you.", 1
Upon, 1
which, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
take, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
in, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
des, 1
Princes,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
depriving, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
company, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son., 1
To, 1
this, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
past, 1
his, 1
son, 1
had, 1
lived, 1
independently, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
his, 1
own, 1
horses, 1
and, 1
carriages,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
not, 1
having, 1
come, 1
together,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
difficult, 1
for, 1
them, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
separately., 1
The, 1
major, 1
seated, 1
himself,, 1
therefore,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
charmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
ideas, 1
of, 1
order, 1
and, 1
economy, 1
which, 1
ruled, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
who,, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
his, 1
son, 1
60,000, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
might, 1
be, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
500,000, 1
or, 1
600,000, 1
livres., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Andrea,, 1
he, 1
began,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
showing, 1
off,, 1
to, 1
scold, 1
his, 1
groom,, 1
who,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
bringing, 1
the, 1
tilbury, 1
to, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
door,, 1
thus, 1
giving, 1
him, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
of, 1
walking, 1
thirty, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
it., 1
The, 1
groom, 1
heard, 1
him, 1
with, 1
humility,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
bit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
impatient, 1
animal, 1
with, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
right, 1
held, 1
out, 1
the, 1
reins, 1
to, 1
Andrea,, 1
who,, 1
taking, 1
them, 1
from, 1
him,, 1
rested, 1
his, 1
polished, 1
boot, 1
lightly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
step., 1
At, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
touched, 1
his, 1
shoulder., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
thinking, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
or, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
something, 1
they, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
just, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
starting., 1
But, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
either, 1
of, 1
these,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
face,, 1
sunburnt,, 1
and, 1
encircled, 1
by, 1
a, 1
beard,, 1
with, 1
eyes, 1
brilliant, 1
as, 1
carbuncles,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
which, 1
displayed, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
set, 1
of, 1
white, 1
teeth,, 1
pointed, 1
and, 1
sharp, 1
as, 1
the, 1
wolf's, 1
or, 1
jackal's., 1
A, 1
red, 1
handkerchief, 1
encircled, 1
his, 1
gray, 1
head;, 1
torn, 1
and, 1
filthy, 1
garments, 1
covered, 1
his, 1
large, 1
bony, 1
limbs,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though,, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
skeleton,, 1
they, 1
would, 1
rattle, 1
as, 1
he, 1
walked;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
leaned, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
shoulder,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
thing, 1
Andrea, 1
saw,, 1
seemed, 1
of, 1
gigantic, 1
size., 1
Did, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
recognize, 1
that, 1
face, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lantern, 1
in, 1
his, 1
tilbury,, 1
or, 1
was, 1
he, 1
merely, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
horrible, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
interrogator?, 1
We, 1
cannot, 1
say;, 1
but, 1
only, 1
relate, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
he, 1
shuddered, 1
and, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
suddenly., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
disturb, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
red, 1
handkerchief,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
want, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
no, 1
right, 1
to, 1
beg, 1
at, 1
night,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
groom,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
rid, 1
his, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
troublesome, 1
intruder., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
begging,, 1
my, 1
fine, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
the, 1
servant,, 1
with, 1
so, 1
ironical, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
eye,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
frightful, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
withdrew;, 1
"I, 1
only, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
say, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
words, 1
to, 1
your, 1
master,, 1
who, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
commission, 1
to, 1
execute, 1
about, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1
ago.", 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
with, 1
sufficient, 1
nerve, 1
for, 1
his, 1
servant, 1
not, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
his, 1
agitation,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?, 1
Speak, 1
quickly,, 1
friend.", 1
The, 1
man, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice:, 1
"I, 1
wish--I, 1
wish, 1
you, 1
to, 1
spare, 1
me, 1
the, 1
walk, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Paris., 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
tired,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
eaten, 1
so, 1
good, 1
a, 1
dinner, 1
as, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
stand.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
familiarity., 1
"Tell, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
said--"tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
want, 1
you, 1
to, 1
take, 1
me, 1
up, 1
in, 1
your, 1
fine, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
carry, 1
me, 1
back.", 1
Andrea, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
but, 1
said, 1
nothing., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
thrusting, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pockets,, 1
and, 1
looking, 1
impudently, 1
at, 1
the, 1
youth;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
whim, 1
into, 1
my, 1
head;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
understand,, 1
Master, 1
Benedetto?", 1
At, 1
this, 1
name,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
reflected, 1
a, 1
little,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
groom,, 1
saying,, 1
"This, 1
man, 1
is, 1
right;, 1
I, 1
did, 1
indeed, 1
charge, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
commission,, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
must, 1
tell, 1
me;, 1
walk, 1
to, 1
the, 1
barrier,, 1
there, 1
take, 1
a, 1
cab,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
too, 1
late.", 1
The, 1
surprised, 1
groom, 1
retired., 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
at, 1
least, 1
reach, 1
a, 1
shady, 1
spot,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"Oh,, 1
as, 1
for, 1
that,, 1
I'll, 1
take, 1
you, 1
to, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
place,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man, 1
with, 1
the, 1
handkerchief;, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
horse's, 1
bit, 1
he, 1
led, 1
the, 1
tilbury, 1
where, 1
it, 1
was, 1
certainly, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
any, 1
one, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
that, 1
Andrea, 1
conferred, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
"Don't, 1
think, 1
I, 1
want, 1
the, 1
glory, 1
of, 1
riding, 1
in, 1
your, 1
fine, 1
carriage,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"oh,, 1
no,, 1
it's, 1
only, 1
because, 1
I, 1
am, 1
tired,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
little, 1
business, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
over, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
"Come,, 1
step, 1
in,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
pity, 1
this, 1
scene, 1
had, 1
not, 1
occurred, 1
in, 1
daylight,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
curious, 1
to, 1
see, 1
this, 1
rascal, 1
throwing, 1
himself, 1
heavily, 1
down, 1
on, 1
the, 1
cushion, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
young, 1
and, 1
elegant, 1
driver, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tilbury., 1
Andrea, 1
drove, 1
past, 1
the, 1
last, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
village, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
who, 1
smiled, 1
complacently,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
well-pleased, 1
to, 1
find, 1
himself, 1
travelling, 1
in, 1
so, 1
comfortable, 1
a, 1
vehicle., 1
Once, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Auteuil,, 1
Andrea, 1
looked, 1
around,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
neither, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
nor, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
stopping, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
and, 1
crossing, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
before, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
he, 1
asked,--"Now,, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
why, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
disturb, 1
my, 1
tranquillity?", 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
why, 1
you, 1
deceived, 1
me?", 1
"How, 1
have, 1
I, 1
deceived, 1
you?", 1
"'How,', 1
do, 1
you, 1
ask?, 1
When, 1
we, 1
parted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Var,, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
you, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
travel, 1
through, 1
Piedmont, 1
and, 1
Tuscany;, 1
but, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Paris.", 1
"How, 1
does, 1
that, 1
annoy, 1
you?", 1
"It, 1
does, 1
not;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
my, 1
purpose.", 1
"So,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
speculating, 1
upon, 1
me?", 1
"What, 1
fine, 1
words, 1
he, 1
uses!", 1
"I, 1
warn, 1
you,, 1
Master, 1
Caderousse,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
mistaken.", 1
"Well,, 1
well,, 1
don't, 1
be, 1
angry,, 1
my, 1
boy;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
well, 1
enough, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
unfortunate;, 1
and, 1
misfortunes, 1
make, 1
us, 1
jealous., 1
I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
were, 1
earning, 1
a, 1
living, 1
in, 1
Tuscany, 1
or, 1
Piedmont, 1
by, 1
acting, 1
as, 1
facchino, 1
or, 1
cicerone,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
pitied, 1
you, 1
sincerely,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
would, 1
a, 1
child, 1
of, 1
my, 1
own., 1
You, 1
know, 1
I, 1
always, 1
did, 1
call, 1
you, 1
my, 1
child.", 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
what, 1
then?", 1
"Patience--patience!", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
patient,, 1
but, 1
go, 1
on.", 1
"All, 1
at, 1
once, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
with, 1
a, 1
groom,, 1
a, 1
tilbury,, 1
and, 1
fine, 1
new, 1
clothes., 1
You, 1
must, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
a, 1
mine,, 1
or, 1
else, 1
become, 1
a, 1
stockbroker.", 1
"So, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
confess,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
jealous?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
pleased--so, 1
pleased, 1
that, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
congratulate, 1
you;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
quite, 1
properly, 1
dressed,, 1
I, 1
chose, 1
my, 1
opportunity,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
not, 1
compromise, 1
you.", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
opportunity, 1
you, 1
have, 1
chosen!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Andrea;, 1
"you, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
before, 1
my, 1
servant.", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I, 1
help, 1
that,, 1
my, 1
boy?, 1
I, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you, 1
when, 1
I, 1
can, 1
catch, 1
you., 1
You, 1
have, 1
a, 1
quick, 1
horse,, 1
a, 1
light, 1
tilbury,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
naturally, 1
as, 1
slippery, 1
as, 1
an, 1
eel;, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
missed, 1
you, 1
to-night,, 1
I, 1
might, 1
not, 1
have, 1
had, 1
another, 1
chance.", 1
"You, 1
see,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
conceal, 1
myself.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
lucky;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
I, 1
could, 1
say, 1
as, 1
much,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
do, 1
conceal, 1
myself;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
was, 1
afraid, 1
you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
did,", 1
added, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
his, 1
unpleasant, 1
smile., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
very, 1
polite, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
affectionately, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
Benedetto,, 1
my, 1
old, 1
friend,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
right--take, 1
care,, 1
or, 1
I, 1
may, 1
become, 1
troublesome.", 1
This, 1
menace, 1
smothered, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
passion., 1
He, 1
urged, 1
the, 1
horse, 1
again, 1
into, 1
a, 1
trot., 1
"You, 1
should, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
so, 1
to, 1
an, 1
old, 1
friend, 1
like, 1
me,, 1
Caderousse,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
said, 1
just, 1
now;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
native, 1
of, 1

"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
then, 1
now, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are?", 1
"No,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
in, 1
Corsica;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
old, 1

out, 1
of, 1

everything, 1

it, 1

fault, 1
if, 1
fortune,, 1

has, 1

Good,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
sparkling, 1
with, 1
avarice., 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
well, 1
enough, 1
before, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
becoming, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
excited., 1
"If, 1

had, 1
been, 1

handkerchief, 1

"You, 1
wrong, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
boy;, 1
now, 1
I, 1
have, 1
found, 1
you,, 1
nothing, 1
prevents, 1
my, 1
being, 1
as, 1
well-dressed, 1

coats, 1
you, 1
will, 1
give, 1
me, 1
one, 1
of, 1

I, 1
used, 1
to, 1
divide, 1
my, 1
soup, 1

beans, 1
with, 1
you, 1
when, 1
you, 1
were, 1
hungry.", 1
"True,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"What, 1
an, 1
appetite, 1
you, 1
used, 1
to, 1
have!, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
as, 1
good, 1
now?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea,, 1
laughing., 1
"How, 1
did, 1
you, 1
come, 1
to, 1
be, 1
dining, 1
with, 1
that, 1
prince, 1
whose, 1
house, 1
you, 1

"He, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
prince;, 1
simply, 1
a, 1
count.", 1
"A, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
one, 1
too,, 1

"Yes;, 1

you, 1
had, 1
better, 1
not, 1
have, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
him,, 1

gentleman.", 1
"Oh,, 1
be, 1
easy!, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
design, 1
upon, 1
your, 1
count,, 1

you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
him, 1
all, 1
to, 1
yourself., 1
But,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
again, 1
smiling, 1
with, 1
the, 1
disagreeable, 1
expression, 1
he, 1
had, 1
before, 1
assumed,, 1
"you, 1
must, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
it--you, 1
understand?", 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
month"--, 1
"Well?", 1
"I, 1
could, 1
live"--, 1
"Upon, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
francs!", 1
"Come--you, 1

me;, 1

that, 1
with"--, 1
"With?", 1
"With, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
francs, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
happy.", 1
"Here, 1
are, 1
two, 1
hundred,", 1
said, 1
Andrea;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
ten, 1
gold, 1
louis, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Good!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Apply, 1
to, 1
the, 1
steward, 1

"There, 1
now,, 1
again, 1
you, 1
degrade, 1
me.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"By, 1
making, 1
me, 1

Take, 1
it, 1
from, 1
me, 1

"Come,, 1
come;, 1
I, 1
always, 1
said, 1
you, 1
were, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
fellow,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
blessing, 1
when, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
happens, 1
to, 1
such, 1

me, 1
all, 1
about, 1
it?", 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know?", 1
asked, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
"What?, 1
do, 1
you, 1
again, 1
defy, 1
me?", 1
"No;, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1

my, 1

a, 1
real, 1
father?", 1
"Yes,, 1

he, 1
pays, 1
me"--, 1
"You'll, 1
honor, 1
and, 1
believe, 1
him--that's, 1
right., 1
What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"Major, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
pleased, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"So, 1
far, 1
I, 1
have, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
his, 1
purpose.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
found, 1
this, 1
father, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"The, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
house, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
left?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1

would, 1
try, 1
and, 1
find, 1
me, 1
a, 1

him., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you, 1

"I?", 1
"Yes,, 1
you.", 1

you--what, 1
will, 1
you, 1

peer, 1
of, 1
France?", 1

said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"who, 1
knows?", 1
"Major, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
is, 1
already, 1
one,, 1
perhaps;, 1

abolished.", 1
"No, 1
politics,, 1
Caderousse., 1

now, 1
that, 1

Not, 1
at, 1
all?", 1

for, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
with, 1

head,, 1
with, 1

was, 1
there, 1

in, 1
all, 1
about, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs,--why,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
certainly, 1
be, 1
arrested, 1
at, 1
the, 1
barriers., 1
Then,, 1
to, 1
justify, 1
myself,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say, 1
that, 1
you, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
the, 1
money;, 1
this, 1
would, 1
cause, 1
inquiries,, 1

left, 1

no,, 1
my, 1
boy;, 1
I, 1
prefer, 1
remaining, 1
honorably, 1
in, 1
the, 1
capital.", 1
Andrea, 1
scowled., 1
Certainly,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
owned,, 1
the, 1
reputed, 1
son, 1
of, 1
Major, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
was, 1
a, 1
wilful, 1
fellow., 1
He, 1
drew, 1
up, 1
for, 1
a, 1
minute,, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
fell, 1
instantly, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
began, 1
playing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pistol., 1
But,, 1
meanwhile,, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
never, 1
taken, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
off, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
behind, 1
his, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
long, 1
Spanish, 1
knife,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
always, 1
carried, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
need., 1
The, 1
two, 1
friends,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
see,, 1
were, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
and, 1
understood, 1
one, 1
another., 1
Andrea's, 1
hand, 1
left, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
inoffensively,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
carried, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
red, 1
mustache,, 1
which, 1
it, 1
played, 1
with, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time., 1
"Good, 1
Caderousse,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"how, 1
happy, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
my, 1
best,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
du, 1
Gard,, 1
shutting, 1
up, 1
his, 1
knife., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
go, 1
into, 1
Paris., 1
But, 1
how, 1
will, 1
you, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
without, 1
exciting, 1
suspicion?, 1
It, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
in, 1
more, 1
danger, 1
riding, 1
than, 1
on, 1
foot.", 1
"Wait,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"we, 1
shall, 1
see.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
took, 1
the, 1
great-coat, 1
with, 1
the, 1
large, 1
collar,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
groom, 1
had, 1
left, 1
behind, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tilbury,, 1
and, 1
put, 1
it, 1
on, 1
his, 1
back;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
took, 1
off, 1
Cavalcanti's, 1
hat,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
own, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
he, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
careless, 1
attitude, 1
of, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
whose, 1
master, 1
drives, 1
himself., 1
"But,, 1
tell, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
bareheaded?", 1
"Pooh,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
so, 1
windy, 1
that, 1
your, 1
hat, 1
can, 1
easily, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
have, 1
blown, 1
off.", 1
"Come,, 1
come;, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
this,", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
waiting, 1
for?", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
the, 1
cause.", 1
"Hush,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
They, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
without, 1
accident., 1
At, 1
the, 1
first, 1
cross, 1
street, 1
Andrea, 1
stopped, 1
his, 1
horse,, 1
and, 1
Caderousse, 1
leaped, 1
out., 1
"Well!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,--"my, 1
servant's, 1
coat, 1
and, 1
my, 1
hat?", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
like, 1
me, 1
to, 1
risk, 1
taking, 1
cold?", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
"You?, 1
Oh,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
young, 1
while, 1
I, 1
am, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
get, 1
old., 1
Au, 1
revoir,, 1
Benedetto;", 1
and, 1
running, 1
into, 1
a, 1
court,, 1
he, 1
disappeared., 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
sighing,, 1
"one, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
completely, 1
happy, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world!", 1

the, 1
three, 1
young, 1
people, 1
separated--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1

Morrel, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Boulevards,, 1

to, 1
the, 1
Pont, 1
de, 1

Debray, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Quai., 1
Most, 1
probably, 1
Morrel, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
their, 1
"domestic, 1
hearths,", 1
as, 1
they, 1
say, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
of, 1

well-turned, 1
speeches,, 1
and, 1
in, 1

theatre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Richelieu, 1
in, 1
well-written, 1
pieces;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
case, 1
with, 1
Debray., 1
When, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
wicket, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Louvre,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
galloped, 1
across, 1
the, 1
Carrousel,, 1
passed, 1
through, 1

and,, 1
issuing, 1
from, 1

after, 1
having, 1
deposited, 1
him, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Honore,, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
at, 1
her, 1
own, 1
house., 1
Debray,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
familiar, 1
with, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
entered, 1
first, 1
into, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
threw, 1
his, 1
bridle, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
a, 1
footman,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
her, 1
to, 1
her, 1
apartments., 1
The, 1
gate, 1
once, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
Debray, 1
and, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
he, 1
asked,--"What, 1
was, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
Hermine?, 1
and, 1
why, 1
were, 1
you, 1
so, 1
affected, 1
at, 1
that, 1
story,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
fable,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
related?", 1
"Because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
in, 1
such, 1
shocking, 1
spirits, 1
all, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"No,, 1
Hermine,", 1
replied, 1
Debray;, 1
"you, 1
cannot, 1
make, 1
me, 1
believe, 1
that;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
in, 1
excellent, 1
spirits, 1
when, 1
you, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count's., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
disagreeable,, 1
certainly,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
know, 1
how, 1
much, 1
you, 1
care, 1
for, 1
his, 1
ill-humor., 1
Some, 1
one, 1
has, 1
vexed, 1
you;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
no, 1
one, 1
to, 1
annoy, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
deceived,, 1
Lucien,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
"and, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you, 1
is, 1
really, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ill-humor, 1
you, 1
remarked,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
it, 1
worth, 1
while, 1
to, 1
allude, 1
to.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
suffering, 1
from, 1
that, 1
nervous, 1
irritability, 1
which, 1
women, 1
frequently, 1
cannot, 1
account, 1
for, 1
even, 1
to, 1
themselves;, 1
or, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
guessed,, 1
she, 1
had, 1
experienced, 1
some, 1
secret, 1
agitation, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
not, 1
acknowledge, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one., 1
Being, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
former, 1
of, 1
these, 1
symptoms, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inherent, 1
penalties, 1
of, 1
womanhood,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
then, 1
press, 1
his, 1
inquiries,, 1
but, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
a, 1
more, 1
appropriate, 1
opportunity, 1
when, 1
he, 1
should, 1
again, 1
interrogate, 1
her,, 1
or, 1
receive, 1
an, 1
avowal, 1
proprio, 1
motu., 1
At, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
her, 1
apartment, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
met, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Cornelie,, 1
her, 1
confidential, 1
maid., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
doing?", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"She, 1
practiced, 1
all, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed,", 1
replied, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Cornelie., 1
"Yet, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
her, 1
piano.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
playing, 1
while, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
in, 1
bed.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"come, 1
and, 1
undress, 1
me.", 1
They, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
bedroom., 1
Debray, 1
stretched, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
large, 1
couch,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
her, 1
dressing-room, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Cornelie., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Lucien,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
always, 1
complaining, 1
that, 1
Eugenie, 1
will, 1
not, 1
address, 1
a, 1
word, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
Lucien,, 1
playing, 1
with, 1
a, 1
little, 1
dog,, 1
who,, 1
recognizing, 1
him, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
be, 1
caressed,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
who, 1
makes, 1
similar, 1
complaints,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
Morcerf, 1
say, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
extract, 1
a, 1
word, 1
from, 1
his, 1
betrothed.", 1
"True,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
"yet, 1
I, 1
think, 1
this, 1
will, 1
all, 1
pass, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
one, 1
day, 1
see, 1
her, 1
enter, 1
your, 1
study.", 1
"My, 1
study?", 1
"At, 1
least, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister.", 1
"Why, 1
so!", 1
"To, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
an, 1
engagement, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Opera., 1
Really,, 1
I, 1
never, 1
saw, 1
such, 1
an, 1
infatuation, 1
for, 1
music;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
ridiculous, 1
for, 1
a, 1
young, 1
lady, 1
of, 1
fashion.", 1
Debray, 1
smiled., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"let, 1
her, 1
come,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
consent, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baron,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
will, 1
try, 1
and, 1
give, 1
her, 1
an, 1
engagement,, 1
though, 1
we, 1
are, 1
very, 1
poor, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
such, 1
talent, 1
as, 1
hers.", 1
"Go,, 1
Cornelie,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
require, 1
you, 1
any, 1
longer.", 1
Cornelie, 1
obeyed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
next, 1
minute, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
left, 1
her, 1
room, 1
in, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
loose, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
came, 1
and, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
close, 1
to, 1
Debray., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
began, 1
thoughtfully, 1
to, 1
caress, 1
the, 1
little, 1
spaniel., 1
Lucien, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
silence., 1
"Come,, 1
Hermine,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time,, 1
"answer, 1
candidly,--something, 1
vexes, 1
you--is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
so?", 1
"Nothing,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
And, 1
yet,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
breathe,, 1
she, 1
rose, 1
and, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
looking-glass., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
frightful, 1
to-night,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
Debray, 1
rose,, 1
smiling,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
contradict, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
latter, 1
point,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened, 1
suddenly., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
appeared;, 1
Debray, 1
reseated, 1
himself., 1
At, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
with, 1
an, 1
astonishment, 1
she, 1
took, 1
no, 1
trouble, 1
to, 1
conceal., 1
"Good-evening,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker;, 1
"good-evening,, 1
M., 1
Debray.", 1
Probably, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
visit, 1
signified, 1
a, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sharp, 1
words, 1
he, 1
had, 1
uttered, 1
during, 1
the, 1
day., 1
Assuming, 1
a, 1
dignified, 1
air,, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
to, 1
Debray,, 1
without, 1
answering, 1
her, 1
husband., 1
"Read, 1
me, 1
something,, 1
M., 1
Debray,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
slightly, 1
disturbed, 1
at, 1
this, 1
visit,, 1
recovered, 1
himself, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
calmness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
up, 1
a, 1
book, 1
marked, 1
by, 1
a, 1
mother-of-pearl, 1
knife, 1
inlaid, 1
with, 1
gold., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
will, 1
tire, 1
yourself,, 1
baroness,, 1
by, 1
such, 1
late, 1
hours,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Debray, 1
lives, 1
some, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
here.", 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
petrified,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
Danglars, 1
speak, 1
so, 1
calmly, 1
and, 1
politely,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
it, 1
was, 1
apparent, 1
that, 1
beneath, 1
outward, 1
politeness, 1
there, 1
really, 1
lurked, 1
a, 1
determined, 1
spirit, 1
of, 1
opposition, 1
to, 1
anything, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
might, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
do., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
was, 1
also, 1
surprised,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
her, 1
astonishment, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
which, 1
would, 1
doubtless, 1
have, 1
had, 1
some, 1
effect, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
intently, 1
occupied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
closing, 1
stock, 1
quotations., 1
The, 1
result, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
proud, 1
look, 1
entirely, 1
failed, 1
of, 1
its, 1
purpose., 1
"M., 1
Lucien,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
sleep,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
things, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
this, 1
evening,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
must, 1
listen, 1
to,, 1
even, 1
though, 1
you, 1
slept, 1
while, 1
hearing, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Lucien, 1
coldly., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Debray,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
kill, 1
yourself, 1
to-night, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
the, 1
follies, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
can, 1
hear, 1
them, 1
as, 1
well, 1
to-morrow;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
claim, 1
to-night, 1
and, 1
will, 1
devote, 1
it,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
allow, 1
me,, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
over, 1
some, 1
serious, 1
matters, 1
with, 1
my, 1
wife.", 1
This, 1
time, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
was, 1
so, 1
well, 1
aimed,, 1
and, 1
hit, 1
so, 1
directly,, 1
that, 1
Lucien, 1
and, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
were, 1
staggered,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
interrogated, 1
each, 1
other, 1
with, 1
their, 1
eyes,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
help, 1
against, 1
this, 1
aggression,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
irresistible, 1
will, 1
of, 1
the, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
prevailed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
husband, 1
was, 1
victorious., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
you, 1
out,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Debray,", 1
continued, 1
Danglars;, 1
"oh,, 1
no,, 1
not, 1
at, 1
all., 1
An, 1
unexpected, 1
occurrence, 1
forces, 1
me, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
little, 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
me;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
so, 1
rarely, 1
I, 1
make, 1
such, 1
a, 1
request,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
cannot, 1
grudge, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
Debray, 1
muttered, 1
something,, 1
bowed, 1
and, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
knocking, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
like, 1
Nathan, 1
in, 1
"Athalie.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
extraordinary,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
"how, 1
easily, 1
these, 1
husbands,, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
ridicule,, 1
gain, 1
an, 1
advantage, 1
over, 1
us.", 1
Lucien, 1
having, 1
left,, 1
Danglars, 1
took, 1
his, 1
place, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sofa,, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
open, 1
book,, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dreadfully, 1
dictatorial, 1
attitude,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
playing, 1
with, 1
the, 1
dog;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
animal,, 1
not, 1
liking, 1
him, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
Debray,, 1
and, 1
attempting, 1
to, 1
bite, 1
him,, 1
Danglars, 1
seized, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
skin, 1
of, 1
his, 1
neck, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
him, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
couch, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
The, 1
animal, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
during, 1
the, 1
transit,, 1
but,, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
its, 1
destination,, 1
it, 1
crouched, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
cushions,, 1
and, 1
stupefied, 1
at, 1
such, 1
unusual, 1
treatment, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
motionless., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
sir,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
improving?, 1
Generally, 1
you, 1
are, 1
only, 1
rude,, 1
but, 1
to-night, 1
you, 1
are, 1
brutal.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
because, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
a, 1
worse, 1
humor, 1
than, 1
usual,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars., 1
Hermine, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
with, 1
supreme, 1
disdain., 1
These, 1
glances, 1
frequently, 1
exasperated, 1
the, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
but, 1
this, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
took, 1
no, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
them., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
have, 1
I, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
your, 1
ill-humor?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
irritated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
impassibility, 1
of, 1
her, 1
husband;, 1
"do, 1
these, 1
things, 1
concern, 1
me?, 1
Keep, 1
your, 1
ill-humor, 1
at, 1
home, 1
in, 1
your, 1
money, 1
boxes,, 1
or,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
clerks, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
pay,, 1
vent, 1
it, 1
upon, 1
them.", 1
"Not, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars;, 1

were, 1

who, 1
told, 1
me, 1
of, 1

Haitian, 1
funds., 1
You, 1
had, 1
dreamed, 1

had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
harbor, 1
at, 1
Havre,, 1
that, 1

had, 1
looked, 1

made., 1
I, 1
know, 1
how, 1
clear-sighted, 1
your, 1
dreams, 1
are;, 1
I, 1
therefore, 1
purchased, 1
immediately, 1
as, 1
many, 1
shares, 1
as, 1
I, 1
could, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Haitian, 1
debt,, 1

I, 1
gained, 1
400,000, 1

it,, 1

100,000, 1
have, 1

you., 1
You, 1
spent, 1
it, 1
as, 1
you, 1
pleased;, 1

was, 1
your, 1

In, 1
March, 1

a, 1
railway., 1
Three, 1
companies, 1
presented, 1
themselves,, 1
each, 1
offering, 1
equal, 1
securities., 1
You, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
your, 1
instinct,--and, 1
although, 1
you, 1
pretend, 1
to, 1
know, 1
nothing, 1
about, 1
speculations,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
that, 1
your, 1
comprehension, 1
is, 1
very, 1
clear, 1
upon, 1
certain, 1
affairs,--well,, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
your, 1
instinct, 1

you, 1
to, 1

grant, 1
would, 1
be, 1
given, 1
to, 1
the, 1
company, 1
called, 1

I, 1
bought, 1
two, 1

shares, 1
of, 1

company;, 1
as, 1
you, 1
had, 1
foreseen,, 1

trebled, 1

am, 1

it.", 1
"That's, 1
fortunate.", 1
"In, 1
April, 1
you, 1
went, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
at, 1

what, 1
then?", 1

yes,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
just, 1
after, 1

returned, 1
to, 1

out,, 1

I, 1
no, 1

away,, 1

day, 1

find, 1
the, 1
news, 1
was, 1
false,, 1

by, 1
this, 1
false, 1
report, 1

lost, 1
700,000, 1

"Well?", 1
"Well,, 1

gave, 1
you, 1
a, 1
fourth, 1

enraged., 1

cried,, 1

time, 1

wished, 1
to, 1
study, 1
music,, 1
under, 1

celebrated, 1
baritone, 1

made, 1
such, 1
a, 1
successful, 1
appearance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Theatre, 1
Italien;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
dancing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
danseuse, 1
who, 1
acquired, 1
such, 1
a, 1
reputation, 1
in, 1
London., 1
This, 1
cost, 1
me,, 1
on, 1
your, 1
account, 1
and, 1
mine,, 1
100,000, 1
francs., 1
I, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1
for, 1
we, 1
must, 1
have, 1
peace, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
and, 1
100,000, 1

lady, 1

gentleman, 1
to, 1
be, 1
properly, 1
instructed, 1
in, 1
music, 1

not, 1
too, 1
much., 1
Well,, 1
you, 1
soon, 1
become, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
singing,, 1

you, 1
take, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
to, 1
study, 1
diplomacy, 1
with, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
secretary., 1
You, 1
understand,, 1
it, 1
signifies, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
me, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
your, 1
lessons, 1
out, 1
of, 1
your, 1
own, 1
cashbox., 1
But, 1
to-day, 1
I, 1
find, 1
you, 1
are, 1
drawing, 1
on, 1
mine,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
your, 1
apprenticeship, 1
may, 1
cost, 1
me, 1
700,000, 1
francs, 1
per, 1
month., 1
Stop, 1
there,, 1
madame,, 1
for, 1
this, 1
cannot, 1
last., 1
Either, 1
the, 1
diplomatist, 1
must, 1
give, 1
his, 1
lessons, 1
gratis,, 1

I, 1
will, 1
tolerate, 1
him,, 1

set, 1

despicable.", 1
"But,", 1
continued, 1
Danglars,, 1

pause, 1
there"--, 1
"Insults!", 1

are, 1
right;, 1

Besides,, 1
how, 1
do, 1
I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
political, 1
trick,, 1

excite,, 1

concerted, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Debray, 1

"A, 1

said, 1
Hermine, 1
suddenly,, 1
"if, 1

fell, 1
upon, 1

day, 1
following, 1
this, 1
scene,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
banker, 1

about, 1
half-past, 1
twelve,, 1
Madame, 1

ordered, 1
her, 1

went, 1
out., 1

hidden, 1
behind, 1

curtain,, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
departure, 1

had, 1
been, 1
waiting, 1
for., 1

gave, 1
orders, 1

should, 1
be, 1
informed, 1

at, 1
two, 1

called, 1
for, 1

horses,, 1

to, 1
the, 1
Chamber,, 1

inscribed, 1

against, 1

From, 1
twelve, 1
to, 1
two, 1
o'clock, 1

had, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
unsealing, 1

from, 1

been, 1
more, 1
bitter, 1
than, 1

was, 1
engaged, 1
with, 1

one, 1

begged, 1

to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room., 1
While, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
in, 1
the, 1
anteroom,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1

a, 1
man, 1
dressed, 1
as, 1
an, 1
abbe, 1

doubtless, 1
more, 1
familiar, 1
with, 1
the, 1
house, 1
than, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
came, 1
in, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
waiting,, 1
merely, 1
bowed,, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
apartments,, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
A, 1
minute, 1
after, 1
the, 1
door, 1
by, 1
which, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
reopened,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1

that,, 1
I, 1
hold, 1
bills, 1
of, 1
exchange, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
400,000., 1
francs,, 1
payable, 1
at, 1
his, 1
correspondent's, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
this, 1
month., 1
To-day, 1
is, 1
the, 1
30th., 1
I, 1
present, 1
them;, 1
but, 1
my, 1
correspondent, 1
has, 1
disappeared., 1
This,, 1
with, 1
my, 1
Spanish, 1
affairs,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
end, 1
to, 1
the, 1
month.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
really, 1
lost, 1
by, 1
that, 1
affair, 1
in, 1
Spain?", 1
"Yes;, 1
only, 1
700,000, 1
francs, 1
out, 1
of, 1
my, 1
cash-box--nothing, 1
more!", 1
"Why,, 1
how, 1
could, 1
you, 1
make, 1
such, 1
a, 1
mistake--such, 1
an, 1
old, 1
stager?", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
all, 1
my, 1
wife's, 1
fault., 1
She, 1
dreamed, 1
Don, 1
Carlos, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Spain;, 1
she, 1
believes, 1
in, 1
dreams., 1
It, 1
is, 1
magnetism,, 1
she, 1
says,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
she, 1
dreams, 1
a, 1
thing, 1
it, 1
is, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
happen,, 1
she, 1
assures, 1
me., 1
On, 1
this, 1
conviction, 1
I, 1
allow, 1
her, 1
to, 1
speculate,, 1
she, 1
having, 1
her, 1
bank, 1
and, 1
her, 1
stockbroker;, 1
she, 1
speculated, 1
and, 1
lost., 1
It, 1
is, 1
true, 1
she, 1
speculates, 1
with, 1
her, 1
own, 1
money,, 1
not, 1
mine;, 1
nevertheless,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
when, 1
700,000, 1
francs, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
wife's, 1
pocket,, 1
the, 1
husband, 1
always, 1
finds, 1
it, 1
out., 1
But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
this?, 1
Why,, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
has, 1
made, 1
a, 1
tremendous, 1
noise.", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
spoken, 1
of,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
the, 1
details,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
no, 1
one, 1
can, 1
be, 1
more, 1
ignorant, 1
than, 1
I, 1
am, 1
of, 1
the, 1
affairs, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Bourse.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
speculate?", 1
"I?--How, 1
could, 1
I, 1
speculate, 1
when, 1
I, 1
already, 1
have, 1
so, 1
much, 1
trouble, 1
in, 1
regulating, 1
my, 1
income?, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
obliged,, 1
besides, 1
my, 1
steward,, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
a, 1
clerk, 1
and, 1
a, 1
boy., 1
But, 1
touching, 1
these, 1
Spanish, 1
affairs,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
did, 1
not, 1
dream, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Don, 1
Carlos, 1
matter., 1
The, 1
papers, 1
said, 1
something, 1
about, 1
it,, 1
did, 1
they, 1
not?", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
the, 1
papers?", 1
"I?--not, 1
the, 1
least, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world;, 1
only, 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
the, 1
honest, 1
Messager, 1
was, 1
an, 1
exception, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rule,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
it, 1
only, 1
announced, 1
telegraphic, 1
despatches.", 1
"Well,, 1
that's, 1
what, 1
puzzles, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars;, 1
"the, 1
news, 1
of, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
Don, 1
Carlos, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
by, 1
telegraph.", 1
"So, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
nearly, 1
1,700,000, 1
francs, 1
this, 1
month.", 1
"Not, 1
nearly,, 1
indeed;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
exactly, 1
my, 1
loss.", 1
"Diable,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
compassionately,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
hard, 1
blow, 1
for, 1
a, 1
third-rate, 1
fortune.", 1
"Third-rate,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
rather, 1
humble,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
that?", 1
"Certainly,", 1
continued, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
make, 1
three, 1
assortments, 1
in, 1
fortune--first-rate,, 1
second-rate,, 1
and, 1
third-rate, 1
fortunes., 1
I, 1
call, 1
those, 1
first-rate, 1
which, 1
are, 1
composed, 1
of, 1
treasures, 1
one, 1
possesses, 1
under, 1
one's, 1
hand,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
mines,, 1

property,, 1

such, 1
states, 1

France,, 1
Austria,, 1
and, 1
England,, 1

these, 1
treasures, 1

property, 1
form, 1
a, 1
total, 1
of, 1
about, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
millions;, 1
I, 1
call, 1
those, 1
second-rate, 1
fortunes,, 1
that, 1
are, 1
gained, 1
by, 1
manufacturing, 1
enterprises,, 1
joint-stock, 1
companies,, 1
viceroyalties,, 1

principalities,, 1
not, 1
drawing, 1
more, 1

1,500,000, 1
francs,, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
forming, 1
a, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
about, 1
fifty, 1
millions;, 1
finally,, 1
I, 1
call, 1
those, 1
third-rate, 1
fortunes,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
composed, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fluctuating, 1
capital,, 1
dependent, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
others,, 1
or, 1
upon, 1
chances, 1
which, 1
a, 1
bankruptcy, 1
involves, 1
or, 1
a, 1
false, 1
telegram, 1
shakes,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
banks,, 1
speculations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day--in, 1
fact,, 1
all, 1
operations, 1
under, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
greater, 1

less, 1
mischances,, 1

whole, 1
bringing, 1
in, 1
a, 1
real, 1
or, 1
fictitious, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
about, 1
fifteen, 1
millions., 1
I, 1
think, 1
this, 1
is, 1
about, 1
your, 1
position,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Confound, 1
it,, 1
yes!", 1
replied, 1
Danglars., 1
"The, 1
result,, 1
then,, 1
of, 1
six, 1
more, 1
such, 1
months, 1
as, 1
this, 1
would, 1
be, 1

"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
becoming, 1
very, 1
pale,, 1
how, 1
you, 1
are, 1
running, 1
on!", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
imagine, 1
seven, 1
such, 1
months,", 1
continued, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone., 1
"Tell, 1
me,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
seven, 1
times, 1
1,700,000, 1
francs, 1
make, 1
nearly, 1
twelve, 1
millions?, 1
No,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not;--well,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
for, 1
if, 1
you, 1
indulged, 1
in, 1
such, 1
reflections,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
never, 1
risk, 1
your, 1
principal,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
to, 1
the, 1
speculator, 1

our, 1
clothes,, 1
some, 1
more, 1
splendid, 1

is, 1
our, 1
credit;, 1

when, 1
a, 1
man, 1

he, 1
has, 1
only, 1
his, 1
skin;, 1
in, 1
the, 1

way,, 1
on, 1
retiring, 1
from, 1
business,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1

your, 1
real, 1
principal, 1
of, 1
about, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
millions,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
most;, 1
for, 1
third-rate, 1
fortunes, 1
are, 1
never, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
fourth, 1
of, 1
what, 1
they, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
be,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
locomotive, 1
on, 1
a, 1
railway,, 1
the, 1
size, 1
of, 1
which, 1
is, 1
magnified, 1
by, 1
the, 1
smoke, 1
and, 1
steam, 1
surrounding, 1
it., 1
Well,, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
millions, 1
which, 1
form, 1
your, 1
real, 1
capital,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
lost, 1
nearly, 1
two, 1
millions,, 1
which, 1
must,, 1
of, 1
course,, 1
in, 1
the, 1

degree, 1
diminish, 1
your, 1
credit, 1
and, 1
fictitious, 1
fortune;, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
out, 1
my, 1
simile,, 1
your, 1
skin, 1
has, 1
been, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
bleeding,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
if, 1
repeated, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
times, 1
will, 1
cause, 1
death--so, 1
pay, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Monsieur, 1
Danglars., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
money?, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
lend, 1
you, 1
some?", 1
"What, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
calculator, 1
you, 1
are!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Danglars,, 1
calling, 1
to, 1
his, 1
assistance, 1
all, 1
his, 1
philosophy, 1
and, 1
dissimulation., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
money, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
by, 1
speculations, 1
which, 1
have, 1
succeeded., 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
up, 1
the, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
by, 1
nutrition., 1
I, 1
lost, 1
a, 1
battle, 1
in, 1
Spain,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
defeated, 1
in, 1
Trieste,, 1
but, 1
my, 1
naval, 1
army, 1
in, 1
India, 1
will, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
some, 1
galleons,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
Mexican, 1
pioneers, 1
will, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
some, 1
mine.", 1
"Very, 1
good,, 1
very, 1
good!, 1
But, 1
the, 1
wound, 1
remains, 1
and, 1
will, 1
reopen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
loss.", 1
"No,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
am, 1
only, 1
embarked, 1
in, 1
certainties,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mountebank, 1
sounding, 1
his, 1
own, 1
praises;, 1
"to, 1
involve, 1
me,, 1
three, 1
governments, 1
must, 1
crumble, 1
to, 1
dust.", 1
"Well,, 1
such, 1
things, 1
have, 1
been.", 1
"That, 1
there, 1
should, 1
be, 1
a, 1
famine!", 1
"Recollect, 1
the, 1
seven, 1
fat, 1
and, 1
the, 1
seven, 1
lean, 1
kine.", 1
"Or,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
should, 1
become, 1
dry,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
the, 1
days, 1
of, 1
Pharaoh,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
then, 1
my, 1
vessels, 1
would, 1
become, 1
caravans.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better., 1
I, 1
congratulate, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Danglars,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
I, 1
was, 1
deceived,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
the, 1
class, 1
of, 1
second-rate, 1
fortunes.", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
may, 1
aspire, 1
to, 1
that, 1
honor,", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
which, 1
reminded, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sickly, 1
moons, 1
which, 1
bad, 1
artists, 1
are, 1
so, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
daubing, 1
into, 1
their, 1
pictures, 1
of, 1
ruins., 1
"But,, 1
while, 1
we, 1
are, 1
speaking, 1
of, 1
business,", 1
Danglars, 1
added,, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
find, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
changing, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
do, 1
for, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
"Give, 1
him, 1
money,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
is, 1
recommended, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
recommendation, 1
seems, 1
good.", 1
"Excellent;, 1
he, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bond, 1
of, 1
40,000, 1
francs,, 1
payable, 1
at, 1
sight,, 1
on, 1
you,, 1
signed, 1
by, 1
Busoni,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
by, 1
you, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
indorsement--of, 1
course,, 1
I, 1
immediately, 1
counted, 1
him, 1
over, 1
the, 1
forty, 1
bank-notes.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
nodded, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
assent., 1
"But, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
all,", 1
continued, 1
Danglars;, 1
"he, 1
has, 1
opened, 1
an, 1
account, 1
with, 1
my, 1
house, 1
for, 1
his, 1
son.", 1
"May, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
how, 1
much, 1
he, 1
allows, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man?", 1
"Five, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
per, 1
month.", 1
"Sixty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
per, 1
year., 1
I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
was, 1
right, 1
in, 1
believing, 1
that, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
stingy, 1
fellow., 1
How, 1
can, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
live, 1
upon, 1
5,000, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
month?", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
if, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
should, 1
want, 1
a, 1
few, 1
thousands, 1
more"--, 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
advance, 1
it;, 1
the, 1
father, 1
will, 1
never, 1
repay, 1
it., 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
these, 1
ultramontane, 1
millionaires;, 1
they, 1
are, 1
regular, 1
misers., 1
And, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
were, 1
they, 1
recommended, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Fenzi,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
in, 1
Florence.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
mean, 1
to, 1

you, 1
will, 1
lose,, 1
but,, 1
nevertheless,, 1
mind, 1
you, 1
hold, 1
to, 1
the, 1
terms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agreement.", 1
"Would, 1
you, 1
not, 1
trust, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
"I?, 1
oh,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
advance, 1
six, 1
millions, 1
on, 1
his, 1
signature., 1
I, 1
was, 1
only, 1
speaking, 1
in, 1
reference, 1
to, 1
the, 1
second-rate, 1
fortunes, 1
we, 1
were, 1
mentioning, 1
just, 1
now.", 1
"And, 1
with, 1
all, 1
this,, 1
how, 1
unassuming, 1
he, 1
is!, 1
I, 1
should, 1
never, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
him, 1
for, 1
anything, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
major.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
would, 1
have, 1
flattered, 1
him,, 1
for, 1
certainly,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
no, 1
manner., 1
The, 1
first, 1
time, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
me, 1
like, 1
an, 1
old, 1
lieutenant, 1

had, 1
grown, 1
mouldy, 1
under, 1

they, 1
are, 1
like, 1
old, 1
Jews, 1
when, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not, 1
glittering, 1
in, 1
Oriental, 1
splendor.", 1
"The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
is, 1
better,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Yes;, 1
a, 1
little, 1
nervous,, 1
perhaps,, 1
but,, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
whole,, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
tolerable., 1
I, 1
was, 1
uneasy, 1
about, 1
him.", 1
"Why?", 1
"Because, 1
you, 1
met, 1
him, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
just, 1
after, 1
his, 1
introduction, 1
into, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
told, 1
me., 1
He, 1
has, 1
been, 1
travelling, 1
with, 1
a, 1
very, 1
severe, 1
tutor,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
to, 1
Paris, 1
before.", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
noblemen, 1
marry, 1
amongst, 1
themselves,, 1
do, 1
they, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars, 1
carelessly;, 1
"they, 1
like, 1
to, 1
unite, 1
their, 1
fortunes.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
usual,, 1
certainly;, 1
but, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
is, 1
an, 1
original, 1
who, 1
does, 1
nothing, 1
like, 1
other, 1
people., 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
thinking, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
brought, 1
his, 1
son, 1
to, 1
France, 1
to, 1
choose, 1
a, 1
wife.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
mentioned?", 1
"Nothing, 1
else, 1
was, 1
talked, 1
of;, 1
only, 1
some, 1
said, 1
he, 1
was, 1
worth, 1
millions,, 1

others, 1
that, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
farthing.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
your, 1
opinion?", 1
"I, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
influence, 1
you,, 1
because, 1
it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
my, 1
own, 1
personal, 1
impression.", 1
"Well,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
that"--, 1
"My, 1
opinion, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
all, 1
these, 1
old, 1
podestas,, 1
these, 1
ancient, 1
condottieri,--for, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
have, 1
commanded, 1
armies, 1
and, 1
governed, 1
provinces,--my, 1
opinion,, 1
I, 1
say,, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
have, 1
buried, 1
their, 1
millions, 1
in, 1
corners,, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1

have, 1
done, 1

to, 1
generation;, 1

the, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
this, 1
is, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
their, 1
yellow, 1
and, 1
dry, 1
appearance,, 1

the, 1
florins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
republic,, 1
which,, 1
from, 1
being, 1
constantly, 1
gazed, 1
upon,, 1
have, 1
become, 1
reflected, 1
in, 1
them.", 1
"Certainly,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
further, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
of, 1
their, 1
not, 1
possessing, 1
an, 1
inch, 1
of, 1

"Very, 1
little,, 1
at, 1

Lucca.", 1
"Ah,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
palace?", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
laughing;, 1
"come,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
something.", 1
"Yes;, 1

more, 1
than, 1
that,, 1

lets, 1
it, 1
to, 1

Minister, 1

I, 1
told, 1
you, 1

fellow, 1
is, 1

you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
flatter, 1
him.", 1
"I, 1
scarcely, 1
know, 1
him;, 1
I, 1

him, 1

times, 1

of, 1

property, 1
lie, 1
dormant, 1
in, 1

is, 1

method,, 1

in, 1

place, 1
great, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1

for, 1
this, 1

of, 1

humility, 1

Cristo., 1
"Well,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
clerk,, 1

was, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
fisherman.", 1

Fernand?", 1

why, 1
did, 1

"Everywhere.", 1
"Well,, 1
write, 1
to, 1
your, 1
correspondent, 1
in, 1

ask, 1
him, 1

"You, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Danglars,, 1
rising, 1
quickly,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
write, 1
to-day.", 1
"Do, 1
so.", 1
"I, 1
will.", 1
"And, 1

it, 1

you.", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
oblige, 1
me.", 1
Danglars, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
but, 1
one, 1
leap, 1
into, 1
his, 1
coupe., 1
Chapter, 1
67., 1
At, 1
the, 1
Office, 1
of, 1
the, 1
King's, 1
Attorney., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
driving, 1
his, 1
horses, 1
at, 1
their, 1
fullest, 1
speed,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
in, 1
her, 1
morning, 1
excursion., 1
We, 1
have, 1
said, 1
that, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
ordered, 1
her, 1
horses,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
left, 1
home, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
She, 1
directed, 1
her, 1
course, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint, 1
Germain,, 1
went, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Mazarine,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Passage, 1
du, 1
Pont-Neuf., 1
She, 1
descended,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
through, 1
the, 1
passage., 1
She, 1
was, 1
very, 1
plainly, 1
dressed,, 1
as, 1
would, 1
be, 1
the, 1
case, 1
with, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
taste, 1
walking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
At, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Guenegaud, 1
she, 1
called, 1
a, 1
cab,, 1
and, 1
directed, 1
the, 1
driver, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Harlay., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
in, 1
the, 1
vehicle,, 1
she, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
her, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
very, 1
thick, 1
black, 1
veil,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
tied, 1
on, 1
to, 1
her, 1
straw, 1
bonnet., 1
She, 1
then, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
bonnet,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
with, 1
pleasure,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
little, 1
pocket-mirror,, 1
that, 1
her, 1
white, 1
complexion, 1
and, 1
brilliant, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
alone, 1
visible., 1
The, 1
cab, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
Pont-Neuf, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Harlay, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Place, 1
Dauphine;, 1
the, 1
driver, 1
was, 1
paid, 1
as, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
stepping, 1
lightly, 1
up, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
soon, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
Salle, 1
des, 1
Pas-Perdus., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
going, 1
on, 1
that, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
many, 1
business-like, 1
persons, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Palais;, 1
business-like, 1
persons, 1
pay, 1
very, 1
little, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
women,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
without, 1
exciting, 1
any, 1
more, 1
attention, 1
than, 1
any, 1
other, 1
woman, 1
calling, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
lawyer., 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
great, 1
press, 1
of, 1
people, 1
in, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
ante-chamber,, 1
but, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
even, 1
to, 1
pronounce, 1
her, 1
name., 1
The, 1
instant, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
the, 1
door-keeper, 1
rose,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
her, 1
whether, 1
she, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
person, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
had, 1
made, 1
an, 1
appointment;, 1
and, 1
on, 1
her, 1
affirmative, 1
answer, 1
being, 1
given,, 1
he, 1
conducted, 1
her, 1
by, 1
a, 1
private, 1
passage, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
office., 1
The, 1
magistrate, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arm-chair,, 1
writing,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
back, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
move, 1
as, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door-keeper, 1
pronounce, 1
the, 1
words,, 1
"Walk, 1
in,, 1
madame,", 1
and, 1
then, 1
reclose, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
no, 1
sooner, 1
had, 1
the, 1
man's, 1
footsteps, 1
ceased,, 1
than, 1
he, 1
started, 1
up,, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
bolts,, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
curtains,, 1
and, 1
examined, 1
every, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Then,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
assured, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
neither, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
nor, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
consequently, 1
relieved, 1
of, 1
doubts,, 1
he, 1
said,--"Thanks,, 1
madame,--thanks, 1
for, 1
your, 1
punctuality;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
accepted,, 1
for, 1
her, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
so, 1
violently, 1
that, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
nearly, 1
suffocated., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
describing, 1
a, 1
half-circle, 1
with, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
place, 1
himself, 1
exactly, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,--"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
since, 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
speaking, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
regret, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
only, 1
now, 1
met, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
painful, 1
conversation.", 1
"Nevertheless,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
have, 1
answered, 1
your, 1
first, 1
appeal,, 1
although, 1
certainly, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
must, 1
be, 1
much, 1
more, 1
painful, 1
for, 1
me, 1
than, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
Villefort, 1
smiled, 1
bitterly., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
then,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
rather, 1
uttering, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
aloud, 1
than, 1
addressing, 1
his, 1
companion,--"it, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
all, 1
our, 1
actions, 1
leave, 1
their, 1
traces--some, 1
sad,, 1
others, 1
bright--on, 1
our, 1
paths;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true, 1
that, 1
every, 1
step, 1
in, 1
our, 1
lives, 1
is, 1
like, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
an, 1
insect, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sands;--it, 1
leaves, 1
its, 1
track!, 1
Alas,, 1
to, 1
many, 1
the, 1
path, 1
is, 1
traced, 1
by, 1
tears.", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
feel, 1
for, 1
my, 1
emotion,, 1
can, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
Spare, 1
me,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you., 1
When, 1
I, 1
look, 1
at, 1
this, 1
room,--whence, 1
so, 1
many, 1
guilty, 1
creatures, 1
have, 1
departed,, 1
trembling, 1
and, 1
ashamed,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
look, 1
at, 1
that, 1
chair, 1
before, 1
which, 1
I, 1
now, 1
sit, 1
trembling, 1
and, 1
ashamed,--oh,, 1
it, 1
requires, 1
all, 1
my, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
me, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
a, 1
very, 1
guilty, 1
woman, 1
and, 1
you, 1
a, 1
menacing, 1
judge.", 1
Villefort, 1
dropped, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
sighed., 1
"And, 1
I,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
my, 1
place, 1
is, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
judge's, 1
seat,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
prisoner's, 1
stool.", 1
"You?", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"Yes,, 1
I.", 1
"I, 1
think,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
exaggerate, 1
your, 1
situation,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
whose, 1
beautiful, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"The, 1
paths, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
were, 1
just, 1
speaking, 1
have, 1
been, 1
traced, 1
by, 1
all, 1
young, 1
men, 1
of, 1
ardent, 1
imaginations., 1
Besides, 1
the, 1
pleasure,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
always, 1
remorse, 1
from, 1
the, 1
indulgence, 1
of, 1
our, 1
passions,, 1
and,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
men, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
from, 1
all, 1
this?, 1
the, 1
world, 1
excuses,, 1
and, 1
notoriety, 1
ennobles, 1
you.", 1
"Madame,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
hypocrite,, 1
or,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
never, 1
deceive, 1
without, 1
a, 1
reason., 1
If, 1
my, 1
brow, 1
be, 1
severe,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
because, 1
many, 1
misfortunes, 1
have, 1
clouded, 1
it;, 1
if, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
be, 1
petrified,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
sustain, 1
the, 1
blows, 1
it, 1
has, 1
received., 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
so, 1
in, 1
my, 1
youth,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
so, 1
on, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
the, 1
betrothal,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
were, 1
all, 1
seated, 1
around, 1
a, 1
table, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
du, 1
Cours, 1
at, 1
Marseilles., 1
But, 1
since, 1
then, 1
everything, 1
has, 1
changed, 1
in, 1
and, 1
about, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
brave, 1
difficulties,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
conflict, 1
to, 1
crush, 1
those, 1
who,, 1
by, 1
their, 1
own, 1
free, 1
will,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
chance,, 1
voluntarily, 1
or, 1
involuntarily,, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
me, 1
in, 1
my, 1
career., 1
It, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
the, 1
case, 1
that, 1
what, 1
we, 1
most, 1
ardently, 1
desire, 1
is, 1
as, 1
ardently, 1
withheld, 1
from, 1
us, 1
by, 1
those, 1
who, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
it,, 1
or, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
snatch, 1
it., 1
Thus,, 1
the, 1
greater, 1
number, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man's, 1
errors, 1
come, 1
before, 1
him, 1
disguised, 1
under, 1
the, 1
specious, 1
form, 1
of, 1
necessity;, 1
then,, 1
after, 1
error, 1
has, 1
been, 1
committed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
excitement,, 1
of, 1
delirium,, 1
or, 1
of, 1
fear,, 1
we, 1
see, 1
that, 1
we, 1
might, 1
have, 1
avoided, 1
and, 1
escaped, 1
it., 1
The, 1
means, 1
we, 1
might, 1
have, 1
used,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
in, 1
our, 1
blindness, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see,, 1
then, 1
seem, 1
simple, 1
and, 1
easy,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
say,, 1
'Why, 1
did, 1
I, 1
not, 1
do, 1
this,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
that?', 1
Women,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
are, 1
rarely, 1
tormented, 1
with, 1
remorse;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
decision, 1
does, 1
not, 1
come, 1
from, 1
you,--your, 1
misfortunes, 1
are, 1
generally, 1
imposed, 1
upon, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
faults, 1
the, 1
results, 1
of, 1
others', 1
crimes.", 1
"In, 1
any, 1
case,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
allow,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
the, 1
fault, 1
were, 1
alone, 1
mine,, 1
I, 1
last, 1
night, 1
received, 1
a, 1
severe, 1
punishment, 1
for, 1
it.", 1
"Poor, 1
thing,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
pressing, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
too, 1
severe, 1
for, 1
your, 1
strength,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
were, 1
twice, 1
overwhelmed,, 1
and, 1
yet"--, 1
"Well?", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
tell, 1
you., 1
Collect, 1
all, 1
your, 1
courage,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
heard, 1
all.", 1
"Ah,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
alarmed,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
there, 1
more, 1
to, 1
hear?", 1
"You, 1
only, 1
look, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is,, 1
indeed,, 1
bad, 1
enough., 1
Well,, 1
picture, 1
to, 1
yourself, 1
a, 1
future, 1
more, 1
gloomy, 1
still--certainly, 1
frightful,, 1
perhaps, 1
sanguinary.", 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
knew, 1
how, 1
calm, 1
Villefort, 1
naturally, 1
was,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
present, 1
excitement, 1
frightened, 1
her, 1
so, 1
much, 1
that, 1
she, 1
opened, 1
her, 1
mouth, 1
to, 1
scream,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
died, 1
in, 1
her, 1
throat., 1
"How, 1
has, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
past, 1
been, 1
recalled?", 1
cried, 1
Villefort;, 1
"how, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
it, 1
has, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tomb, 1
and, 1
the, 1
recesses, 1
of, 1
our, 1
hearts,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
was, 1
buried,, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
us, 1
now,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
phantom,, 1
whitening, 1
our, 1
cheeks, 1
and, 1
flushing, 1
our, 1
brows, 1
with, 1
shame?", 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Hermine,, 1
"doubtless, 1
it, 1
is, 1
chance.", 1
"Chance?", 1
replied, 1
Villefort;, 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
madame,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
such, 1
thing, 1
as, 1
chance.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
has, 1
not, 1
a, 1
fatal, 1
chance, 1
revealed, 1
all, 1
this?, 1
Was, 1
it, 1
not, 1
by, 1
chance, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
bought, 1
that, 1
house?, 1
Was, 1
it, 1
not, 1
by, 1
chance, 1
he, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
to, 1
be, 1
dug, 1
up?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
by, 1
chance, 1
that, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
child, 1
was, 1
disinterred, 1
under, 1
the, 1
trees?--that, 1
poor, 1
innocent, 1
offspring, 1
of, 1
mine,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
never, 1
even, 1
kissed,, 1
but, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
wept, 1
many,, 1
many, 1
tears., 1
Ah,, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
clung, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
when, 1
he, 1
mentioned, 1
the, 1
dear, 1
spoil, 1
found, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
flowers.", 1
"Well,, 1
no,, 1
madame,--this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
news, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hollow, 1
voice--"no,, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
found, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
flowers;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
child, 1
disinterred--no., 1
You, 1
must, 1
not, 1
weep,, 1
no,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
groan,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
tremble!", 1
"What, 1
can, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
shuddering., 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
digging, 1
underneath, 1
these, 1
trees,, 1
found, 1
neither, 1
skeleton, 1
nor, 1
chest,, 1
because, 1
neither, 1
of, 1
them, 1
was, 1
there!", 1
"Neither, 1
of, 1
them, 1
there?", 1
repeated, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
her, 1
staring,, 1
wide-open, 1
eyes, 1
expressing, 1
her, 1
alarm., 1
"Neither, 1
of, 1
them, 1
there!", 1
she, 1
again, 1
said,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
impress, 1
herself, 1
with, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
words, 1
which, 1
escaped, 1
her., 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
burying, 1
his, 1
face, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
"no,, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times, 1
no!", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
bury, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
child, 1
there,, 1
sir?, 1
Why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
deceive, 1
me?, 1
Where, 1
did, 1
you, 1
place, 1
it?, 1
tell, 1
me--where?", 1
"There!, 1
But, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
me--listen--and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
pity, 1
me, 1
who, 1
has, 1
for, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
alone, 1
borne, 1
the, 1
heavy, 1
burden, 1
of, 1
grief, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
reveal,, 1
without, 1
casting, 1
the, 1
least, 1
portion, 1
upon, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
frighten, 1
me!, 1
But, 1
speak;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
listen.", 1
"You, 1
recollect, 1
that, 1
sad, 1
night,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
were, 1
half-expiring, 1
on, 1
that, 1
bed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
red, 1
damask, 1
room,, 1
while, 1
I,, 1
scarcely, 1
less, 1
agitated, 1
than, 1
you,, 1
awaited, 1
your, 1
delivery., 1
The, 1
child, 1
was, 1
born,, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
me--motionless,, 1
breathless,, 1
voiceless;, 1
we, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
dead.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
moved, 1
rapidly,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
she, 1
would, 1
spring, 1
from, 1
her, 1
chair,, 1
but, 1
Villefort, 1
stopped,, 1
and, 1
clasped, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
implore, 1
her, 1
attention., 1
"We, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
dead,", 1
he, 1
repeated;, 1
"I, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chest,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
a, 1
coffin;, 1
I, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
I, 1
dug, 1
a, 1
hole,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
flung, 1
it, 1
down, 1
in, 1
haste., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
I, 1
covered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
earth,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
was, 1
stretched, 1
towards, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
rise,, 1
and,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
a, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
light., 1
I, 1
felt, 1
pain;, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
cry, 1
out,, 1
but, 1
an, 1
icy, 1
shiver, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
my, 1
veins, 1
and, 1
stifled, 1
my, 1
voice;, 1
I, 1
fell, 1
lifeless,, 1
and, 1
fancied, 1
myself, 1
killed., 1
Never, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
forget, 1
your, 1
sublime, 1
courage,, 1
when,, 1
having, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
consciousness,, 1
I, 1
dragged, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
almost, 1
dying, 1
yourself,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
me., 1
We, 1
were, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
silent, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
dreadful, 1
catastrophe., 1
You, 1
had, 1
the, 1
fortitude, 1
to, 1
regain, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
assisted, 1
by, 1
your, 1
nurse., 1
A, 1
duel, 1
was, 1
the, 1
pretext, 1
for, 1
my, 1
wound., 1
Though, 1
we, 1
scarcely, 1
expected, 1
it,, 1
our, 1
secret, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
our, 1
own, 1
keeping, 1
alone., 1
I, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
Versailles;, 1
for, 1
three, 1
months, 1
I, 1
struggled, 1
with, 1
death;, 1
at, 1
last,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
cling, 1
to, 1
life,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
the, 1
South., 1
Four, 1
men, 1
carried, 1
me, 1
from, 1
Paris, 1
to, 1
Chalons,, 1
walking, 1
six, 1
leagues, 1
a, 1
day;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
litter, 1
in, 1
her, 1
carriage., 1
At, 1
Chalons, 1
I, 1
was, 1
put, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
Saone,, 1
thence, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rhone,, 1
whence, 1
I, 1
descended,, 1
merely, 1
with, 1
the, 1
current,, 1
to, 1
Arles;, 1
at, 1
Arles, 1
I, 1
was, 1
again, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
my, 1
litter,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
my, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
Marseilles., 1
My, 1
recovery, 1
lasted, 1
six, 1
months., 1
I, 1
never, 1
heard, 1
you, 1
mentioned,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
dare, 1
inquire, 1
for, 1
you., 1
When, 1
I, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
you,, 1
the, 1
widow, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Nargonne,, 1
had, 1
married, 1
M., 1
Danglars., 1
"What, 1
was, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
my, 1
thoughts, 1
from, 1
the, 1
time, 1
consciousness, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
me?, 1
Always, 1
the, 1
same--always, 1
the, 1
child's, 1
corpse,, 1
coming, 1
every, 1
night, 1
in, 1
my, 1
dreams,, 1
rising, 1
from, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
and, 1
hovering, 1
over, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
with, 1
menacing, 1
look, 1
and, 1
gesture., 1
I, 1
inquired, 1
immediately, 1
on, 1
my, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris;, 1
the, 1
house, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
inhabited, 1
since, 1
we, 1
left, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
had, 1
just, 1
been, 1
let, 1
for, 1
nine, 1
years., 1
I, 1
found, 1
the, 1
tenant., 1
I, 1
pretended, 1
that, 1
I, 1
disliked, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
a, 1
house, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
my, 1
wife's, 1
father, 1
and, 1
mother, 1
should, 1
pass, 1
into, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
strangers., 1
I, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
them, 1
for, 1
cancelling, 1
the, 1
lease;, 1
they, 1
demanded, 1
6,000, 1
francs., 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
given, 1
10,000--I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
given, 1
20,000., 1
I, 1
had, 1
the, 1
money, 1
with, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
made, 1
the, 1
tenant, 1
sign, 1
the, 1
deed, 1
of, 1
resilition,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
had, 1
obtained, 1
what, 1
I, 1
so, 1
much, 1
wanted,, 1
I, 1
galloped, 1
to, 1
Auteuil., 1
"No, 1
one, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
house, 1
since, 1
I, 1
had, 1
left, 1
it., 1
It, 1
was, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
afternoon;, 1
I, 1
ascended, 1
into, 1
the, 1
red, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
night., 1
There, 1
all, 1
the, 1
thoughts, 1
which, 1
had, 1
disturbed, 1
me, 1
during, 1
my, 1
year, 1
of, 1
constant, 1
agony, 1
came, 1
back, 1
with, 1
double, 1
force., 1
The, 1
Corsican,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
declared, 1
the, 1
vendetta, 1
against, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
me, 1
from, 1
Nimes, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
hid, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
me,, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
me, 1
dig, 1
the, 1
grave,, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
me, 1
inter, 1
the, 1
child,--he, 1
might, 1
become, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
your, 1
person,--nay,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
even, 1
then, 1
have, 1
known, 1
it., 1
Would, 1
he, 1
not, 1
one, 1
day, 1
make, 1
you, 1
pay, 1
for, 1
keeping, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
secret?, 1
Would, 1
it, 1
not, 1
be, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
revenge, 1
for, 1
him, 1
when, 1
he, 1
found, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
died, 1
from, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dagger?, 1
It, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
necessary,, 1
before, 1
everything, 1
else,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
all, 1
risks,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
cause, 1
all, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past, 1
to, 1
disappear--that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
destroy, 1
every, 1
material, 1
vestige;, 1
too, 1
much, 1
reality, 1
would, 1
always, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
my, 1
recollection., 1
It, 1
was, 1
for, 1
this, 1
I, 1
had, 1
annulled, 1
the, 1
lease--it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
this, 1
I, 1
had, 1
come--it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
this, 1
I, 1
was, 1
waiting., 1
Night, 1
arrived;, 1
I, 1
allowed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
become, 1
quite, 1
dark., 1
I, 1
was, 1
without, 1
a, 1
light, 1
in, 1
that, 1
room;, 1
when, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
shook, 1
all, 1
the, 1
doors,, 1
behind, 1
which, 1
I, 1
continually, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
see, 1
some, 1
spy, 1
concealed,, 1
I, 1
trembled., 1
I, 1
seemed, 1
everywhere, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
your, 1
moans, 1
behind, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
dared, 1
not, 1
turn, 1
around., 1
My, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
so, 1
violently, 1
that, 1
I, 1
feared, 1
my, 1
wound, 1
would, 1
open., 1
At, 1
length,, 1
one, 1
by, 1
one,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
noises, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
ceased., 1
I, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
fear,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
neither, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
nor, 1
heard,, 1
so, 1
I, 1
decided, 1
upon, 1
descending, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
"Listen,, 1
Hermine;, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
myself, 1
as, 1
brave, 1
as, 1
most, 1
men,, 1
but, 1
when, 1
I, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
my, 1
breast, 1
the, 1
little, 1
key, 1
of, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
found, 1
in, 1
my, 1
coat--that, 1
little, 1
key, 1
we, 1
both, 1
used, 1
to, 1
cherish, 1
so, 1
much,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
have, 1
fastened, 1
to, 1
a, 1
golden, 1
ring--when, 1
I, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
moon, 1
shedding, 1
a, 1
long, 1
stream, 1
of, 1
white, 1
light, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spiral, 1
staircase, 1
like, 1
a, 1
spectre,, 1
I, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
nearly, 1
shrieked., 1
I, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
going, 1
mad., 1
At, 1
last, 1
I, 1
mastered, 1
my, 1
agitation., 1
I, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
step, 1
by, 1
step;, 1
the, 1
only, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
conquer, 1
was, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
trembling, 1
in, 1
my, 1
knees., 1
I, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
railings;, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
relaxed, 1
my, 1
hold, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
fallen., 1
I, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
door., 1
Outside, 1
this, 1
door, 1
a, 1
spade, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
I, 1
took, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
thicket., 1
I, 1
had, 1
provided, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
lantern., 1
In, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lawn, 1
I, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
light, 1
it,, 1
then, 1
I, 1
continued, 1
my, 1
path., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
November,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
verdure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
the, 1
trees, 1
were, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
skeletons, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
bony, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
leaves, 1
sounded, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gravel, 1
under, 1
my, 1
feet., 1
My, 1
terror, 1
overcame, 1
me, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
degree, 1
as, 1
I, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
thicket,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
took, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
from, 1
my, 1
pocket, 1
and, 1
armed, 1
myself., 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
continually, 1
that, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
figure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
between, 1
the, 1
branches., 1
I, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
thicket, 1
with, 1
my, 1
dark, 1
lantern;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
empty., 1
I, 1
looked, 1
carefully, 1
around;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
alone,--no, 1
noise, 1
disturbed, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
but, 1
the, 1
owl,, 1
whose, 1
piercing, 1
cry, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
calling, 1
up, 1
the, 1
phantoms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night., 1
I, 1
tied, 1
my, 1
lantern, 1
to, 1
a, 1
forked, 1
branch, 1
I, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
a, 1
year, 1
before, 1
at, 1
the, 1
precise, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
I, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
dig, 1
the, 1
hole., 1
"The, 1
grass, 1
had, 1
grown, 1
very, 1
thickly, 1
there, 1
during, 1
the, 1
summer,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
autumn, 1
arrived, 1
no, 1
one, 1
had, 1
been, 1
there, 1
to, 1
mow, 1
it., 1
Still, 1
one, 1
place, 1
where, 1
the, 1
grass, 1
was, 1
thin, 1
attracted, 1
my, 1
attention;, 1
it, 1
evidently, 1
was, 1
there, 1
I, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
up, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
work., 1
The, 1
hour,, 1
then,, 1
for, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
waiting, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
year, 1
had, 1
at, 1
length, 1
arrived., 1
How, 1
I, 1
worked,, 1
how, 1
I, 1
hoped,, 1
how, 1
I, 1
struck, 1
every, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
turf,, 1
thinking, 1
to, 1
find, 1
some, 1
resistance, 1
to, 1
my, 1
spade!, 1
But, 1
no,, 1
I, 1
found, 1
nothing,, 1
though, 1
I, 1
had, 1
made, 1
a, 1
hole, 1
twice, 1
as, 1
large, 1
as, 1
the, 1
first., 1
I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
deceived--had, 1
mistaken, 1
the, 1
spot., 1
I, 1
turned, 1
around,, 1
I, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
I, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
the, 1
details, 1
which, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
me, 1
at, 1
the, 1
time., 1
A, 1
cold,, 1
sharp, 1
wind, 1
whistled, 1
through, 1
the, 1
leafless, 1
branches,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
drops, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
my, 1
forehead., 1
I, 1
recollected, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
stabbed, 1
just, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
trampling, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
to, 1
fill, 1
up, 1
the, 1
hole;, 1
while, 1
doing, 1
so, 1
I, 1
had, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
a, 1
laburnum;, 1
behind, 1
me, 1
was, 1
an, 1
artificial, 1
rockery,, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
serve, 1
as, 1
a, 1
resting-place, 1
for, 1
persons, 1
walking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden;, 1
in, 1
falling,, 1
my, 1
hand,, 1
relaxing, 1
its, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
laburnum,, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
coldness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stone., 1
On, 1
my, 1
right, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
tree,, 1
behind, 1
me, 1
the, 1
rock., 1
I, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
attitude,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
myself, 1
down., 1
I, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
began, 1
digging, 1
and, 1
enlarging, 1
the, 1
hole;, 1
still, 1
I, 1
found, 1
nothing,, 1
nothing--the, 1
chest, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
there!", 1
"The, 1
chest, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
there?", 1
murmured, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
choking, 1
with, 1
fear., 1
"Think, 1
not, 1
I, 1
contented, 1
myself, 1
with, 1
this, 1
one, 1
effort,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort., 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
searched, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
thicket., 1
I, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
assassin,, 1
having, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
chest,, 1
and, 1
supposing, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
treasure,, 1
had, 1
intended, 1
carrying, 1
it, 1
off,, 1
but,, 1
perceiving, 1
his, 1
error,, 1
had, 1
dug, 1
another, 1
hole,, 1
and, 1
deposited, 1
it, 1
there;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
could, 1
find, 1
nothing., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
struck, 1
me, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
these, 1
precautions,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
simply, 1
thrown, 1
it, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner., 1
In, 1
the, 1
last, 1
case, 1
I, 1
must, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
daylight, 1
to, 1
renew, 1
my, 1
search., 1
I, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
and, 1
waited.", 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens!", 1
When, 1
daylight, 1
dawned, 1
I, 1
went, 1
down, 1
again., 1
My, 1
first, 1
visit, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
thicket., 1
I, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
find, 1
some, 1
traces, 1
which, 1
had, 1
escaped, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
I, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
up, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
over, 1
a, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twenty, 1
feet, 1
square,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
depth, 1
of, 1
two, 1
feet., 1
A, 1
laborer, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
done, 1
in, 1
a, 1
day, 1
what, 1
occupied, 1
me, 1
an, 1
hour., 1
But, 1
I, 1
could, 1
find, 1
nothing--absolutely, 1
nothing., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
renewed, 1
the, 1
search., 1
Supposing, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
thrown, 1
aside,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
probably, 1
be, 1
on, 1
the, 1
path, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
little, 1
gate;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
examination, 1
was, 1
as, 1
useless, 1
as, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bursting, 1
heart, 1
I, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
thicket,, 1
which, 1
now, 1
contained, 1
no, 1
hope, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
drive, 1
you, 1
mad!", 1
"I, 1
hoped, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
happiness, 1
was, 1
denied, 1
me., 1
However,, 1
recovering, 1
my, 1
strength, 1
and, 1
my, 1
ideas,, 1
'Why,', 1
said, 1
I,, 1
'should, 1
that, 1
man, 1
have, 1
carried, 1
away, 1
the, 1
corpse?'", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
said,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"he, 1
would, 1
require, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
proof.", 1
"Ah,, 1
no,, 1
madame,, 1
that, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be., 1
Dead, 1
bodies, 1
are, 1
not, 1
kept, 1
a, 1
year;, 1
they, 1
are, 1
shown, 1
to, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
evidence, 1
is, 1
taken., 1
Now,, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kind, 1
has, 1
happened.", 1
"What, 1
then?", 1
asked, 1
Hermine,, 1
trembling, 1
violently., 1
"Something, 1
more, 1
terrible,, 1
more, 1
fatal,, 1
more, 1
alarming, 1
for, 1
us--the, 1
child, 1
was,, 1
perhaps,, 1
alive,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
assassin, 1
may, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
it!", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
piercing, 1
cry,, 1
and,, 1
seizing, 1
Villefort's, 1
hands,, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"My, 1
child, 1
was, 1
alive?", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"you, 1
buried, 1
my, 1
child, 1
alive?, 1
You, 1
were, 1
not, 1
certain, 1
my, 1
child, 1
was, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
buried, 1
it?, 1
Ah"--, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
risen,, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
whose, 1
hands, 1
she, 1
wrung, 1
in, 1
her, 1
feeble, 1
grasp., 1
"I, 1
know, 1
not;, 1
I, 1
merely, 1
suppose, 1
so,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
might, 1
suppose, 1
anything, 1
else,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
so, 1
fixed,, 1
it, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
his, 1
powerful, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
verge, 1
of, 1
despair, 1
and, 1
madness., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
child,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
child!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
her, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
stifling, 1
her, 1
sobs, 1
in, 1
her, 1
handkerchief., 1
Villefort,, 1
becoming, 1
somewhat, 1
reassured,, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
to, 1
avert, 1
the, 1
maternal, 1
storm, 1
gathering, 1
over, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
inspire, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
he, 1
felt., 1
"You, 1
understand,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
rising, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
her, 1
in, 1
a, 1
lower, 1
tone,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
lost., 1
This, 1
child, 1
lives,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
one, 1
knows, 1
it, 1
lives--some, 1
one, 1
is, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
our, 1
secret;, 1
and, 1
since, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
speaks, 1
before, 1
us, 1
of, 1
a, 1
child, 1
disinterred,, 1
when, 1
that, 1
child, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
found,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
he, 1
who, 1
is, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
our, 1
secret.", 1
"Just, 1
God,, 1
avenging, 1
God!", 1
murmured, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
Villefort's, 1
only, 1
answer, 1
was, 1
a, 1
stifled, 1
groan., 1
"But, 1
the, 1
child--the, 1
child,, 1
sir?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
agitated, 1
mother., 1
"How, 1
I, 1
have, 1
searched, 1
for, 1
him,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
wringing, 1
his, 1
hands;, 1
"how, 1
I, 1
have, 1
called, 1
him, 1
in, 1
my, 1
long, 1
sleepless, 1
nights;, 1
how, 1
I, 1
have, 1
longed, 1
for, 1
royal, 1
wealth, 1
to, 1
purchase, 1
a, 1
million, 1
of, 1
secrets, 1
from, 1
a, 1
million, 1
of, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
find, 1
mine, 1
among, 1
them!, 1
At, 1
last,, 1
one, 1
day,, 1
when, 1
for, 1
the, 1
hundredth, 1
time, 1
I, 1
took, 1
up, 1
my, 1
spade,, 1
I, 1
asked, 1
myself, 1
again, 1
and, 1
again, 1
what, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
could, 1
have, 1
done, 1
with, 1
the, 1
child., 1
A, 1
child, 1
encumbers, 1
a, 1
fugitive;, 1
perhaps,, 1
on, 1
perceiving, 1
it, 1
was, 1
still, 1
alive,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
river.", 1
"Impossible!", 1
cried, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars:, 1
"a, 1
man, 1
may, 1
murder, 1
another, 1
out, 1
of, 1
revenge,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
deliberately, 1
drown, 1
a, 1
child.", 1
"Perhaps,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort,, 1
"he, 1
had, 1
put, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
foundling, 1
hospital.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
baroness;, 1
"my, 1
child, 1
is, 1
there!", 1
"I, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hospital,, 1
and, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
the, 1
same, 1
night--the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
the, 1
20th, 1
of, 1
September--a, 1
child, 1
had, 1
been, 1
brought, 1
there,, 1
wrapped, 1
in, 1
part, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
linen, 1
napkin,, 1
purposely, 1
torn, 1
in, 1
half., 1
This, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
napkin, 1
was, 1
marked, 1
with, 1
half, 1
a, 1
baron's, 1
crown,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
H.", 1
"Truly,, 1
truly,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"all, 1
my, 1
linen, 1
is, 1
marked, 1
thus;, 1
Monsieur, 1
de, 1
Nargonne, 1
was, 1
a, 1
baronet,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
name, 1
is, 1
Hermine., 1
Thank, 1
God,, 1
my, 1
child, 1
was, 1
not, 1
then, 1
dead!", 1
"No,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
dead.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
so, 1
without, 1
fearing, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
die, 1
of, 1
joy?, 1
Where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
child?", 1
Villefort, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"Do, 1
I, 1
know?", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"and, 1
do, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
if, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
I, 1
would, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
you, 1
all, 1
its, 1
trials, 1
and, 1
all, 1
its, 1
adventures, 1

would, 1
a, 1
dramatist, 1
or, 1
a, 1
novel, 1
writer?, 1
Alas,, 1
no,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
not., 1
A, 1
woman,, 1
about, 1
six, 1
months, 1
after,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
claim, 1
it, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
half, 1
of, 1
the, 1
napkin., 1
This, 1
woman, 1
gave, 1
all, 1
the, 1
requisite, 1
particulars,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
intrusted, 1
to, 1
her.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
should, 1
have, 1
inquired, 1
for, 1
the, 1
woman;, 1
you, 1
should, 1
have, 1
traced, 1
her.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
I, 1
did?, 1
I, 1
feigned, 1
a, 1
criminal, 1
process,, 1
and, 1
employed, 1
all, 1
the, 1
most, 1
acute, 1
bloodhounds, 1
and, 1
skilful, 1
agents, 1
in, 1
search, 1
of, 1
her., 1
They, 1
traced, 1
her, 1
to, 1
Chalons,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
they, 1
lost, 1
her.", 1
"They, 1
lost, 1
her?", 1
"Yes,, 1
forever.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
this, 1
recital, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
a, 1
tear,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
shriek, 1
for, 1
every, 1
detail., 1
"And, 1
this, 1
is, 1
all?", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
stopped, 1
there?", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"I, 1
never, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
search, 1
and, 1
to, 1
inquire., 1
However,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
years, 1
I, 1
had, 1
allowed, 1
myself, 1
some, 1
respite., 1
But, 1
now, 1
I, 1
will, 1
begin, 1
with, 1
more, 1
perseverance, 1
and, 1
fury, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
since, 1
fear, 1
urges, 1
me,, 1
not, 1
my, 1
conscience.", 1
"But,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
can, 1
know, 1
nothing,, 1

would, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
our, 1
society, 1
as, 1
he, 1
does.", 1
"Oh,, 1
the, 1
wickedness, 1
of, 1
man, 1
is, 1
very, 1
great,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"since, 1
it, 1
surpasses, 1
the, 1
goodness, 1
of, 1
God., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
observe, 1
that, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
us?", 1
"No.", 1
"But, 1
have, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
carefully?", 1
"Doubtless, 1
he, 1
is, 1
capricious,, 1

that, 1
is, 1
all;, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
alone, 1
struck, 1
me,--of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
exquisite, 1
things, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
before, 1
us,, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
nothing., 1
I, 1
might, 1
have, 1
suspected, 1
he, 1
was, 1
poisoning, 1
us.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
see, 1
you, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deceived.", 1
"Yes,, 1
doubtless.", 1
"But, 1
believe, 1
me,, 1
that, 1

has, 1
other, 1
projects., 1
For, 1
that, 1
reason, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you,, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
to, 1
warn, 1
you, 1
against, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
especially, 1
against, 1
him., 1
Tell, 1
me,", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
more, 1
steadfastly, 1
on, 1
her, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
done, 1
before,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
reveal, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
our, 1
connection?", 1
"Never,, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one.", 1
"You, 1
understand, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
affectionately;, 1
"when, 1
I, 1
say, 1
any, 1
one,--pardon, 1
my, 1
urgency,--to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
living, 1
I, 1
mean?", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
very, 1
well,", 1
ejaculated, 1
the, 1
baroness;, 1
"never,, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Were, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
writing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
what, 1
had, 1
transpired, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning?, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
keep, 1
a, 1
journal?", 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
life, 1
has, 1
been, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
frivolity;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
it, 1
myself.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
talk, 1
in, 1
your, 1
sleep?", 1
"I, 1
sleep, 1
soundly,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
child;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
remember?", 1
The, 1
color, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness's, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
turned, 1
awfully, 1
pale., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
so, 1
low, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
hardly, 1
be, 1
heard., 1
"Well?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
what, 1
I, 1
now, 1
have, 1
to, 1
do,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort., 1
"In, 1
less, 1
than, 1
one, 1
week, 1
from, 1
this, 1
time, 1
I, 1
will, 1
ascertain, 1
who, 1
this, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is,, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
comes,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
goes,, 1
and, 1
why, 1
he, 1
speaks, 1
in, 1
our, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
children, 1
that, 1
have, 1
been, 1
disinterred, 1
in, 1
a, 1
garden.", 1
Villefort, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
made, 1
the, 1
count, 1
shudder, 1
had, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
him., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
reluctantly, 1
gave, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
led, 1
her, 1
respectfully, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
returned, 1
in, 1
another, 1
cab, 1
to, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
which, 1
she, 1
found, 1
her, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
coachman, 1
sleeping, 1
peacefully, 1
on, 1
his, 1
box, 1
while, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
her., 1

A, 1
Summer, 1

The, 1

day, 1
during, 1
the, 1
interview, 1
between, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
a, 1
travelling-carriage, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
du, 1
Helder,, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
gateway, 1
of, 1
No., 1
27,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
in, 1
the, 1
yard., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
alighted,, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
arm., 1
Albert, 1
soon, 1
left, 1
her,, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
horses,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
arranged, 1
his, 1
toilet,, 1
drove, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
The, 1
count, 1
received, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
habitual, 1
smile., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
ever, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
advance, 1
a, 1
step, 1
in, 1
that, 1
man's, 1
favor., 1
Those, 1
who, 1
would,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
were,, 1
force, 1
a, 1
passage, 1
to, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
found, 1
an, 1
impassable, 1
barrier., 1
Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
ran, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
with, 1
open, 1
arms,, 1
was, 1
chilled, 1
as, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
near,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
the, 1
friendly, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
simply, 1
held, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
shook, 1
it, 1
coldly,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
his, 1
invariable, 1
practice., 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
dear, 1
count.", 1
"Welcome, 1
home, 1
again.", 1
"I, 1
arrived, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
since.", 1
"From, 1
Dieppe?", 1
"No,, 1
from, 1
Treport.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
extremely, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
perfect, 1
indifference., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
news?", 1
"You, 1
should, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
a, 1
stranger,, 1
a, 1
foreigner,, 1
for, 1
news.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1

in, 1
asking, 1
for, 1
news,, 1
I, 1
mean,, 1

you, 1
done, 1
anything, 1
for, 1
me?", 1
"Had, 1
you, 1
commissioned, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
feigning, 1
uneasiness., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
assume, 1
so, 1
much, 1
indifference., 1

is, 1

sympathy, 1

rapidly,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
at, 1
Treport,, 1

felt, 1
the, 1
electric, 1
shock;, 1

have, 1
either, 1
been, 1
working, 1
for, 1
me, 1

of, 1
me.", 1
"Possibly,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
indeed, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
magnetic, 1
wire, 1
I, 1
was, 1
guiding, 1
acted,, 1
indeed,, 1
without, 1
my, 1
knowledge.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
Pray, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
how, 1
it, 1
happened?", 1
"Willingly., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
dined, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it;, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1

him,, 1
my, 1
mother, 1

met, 1
here, 1

Cavalcanti.", 1
"Your, 1
Italian, 1
prince?", 1

Andrea, 1
only, 1
calls, 1
himself, 1

"Calls, 1
himself,, 1

you, 1
say?", 1
"Yes,, 1
calls, 1
himself.", 1

he, 1

a, 1
count?", 1

know, 1
of, 1
him?, 1

give, 1
him, 1
the, 1

strange, 1
man, 1
you, 1
are!, 1
What, 1
next?, 1

a, 1
word.", 1

much, 1
the, 1
worse.", 1
"Why, 1
so?, 1

sympathy!, 1

Morcerf--"if, 1

he, 1
has, 1
done, 1
much, 1
good.", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
ordering, 1
the, 1
strictest, 1
inquiries, 1
to, 1
be, 1
made, 1
respecting, 1
these, 1
two, 1
persons;, 1
his, 1
orders, 1
were, 1
executed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
following, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
received, 1
these, 1
details:--, 1
"The, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
only, 1
for, 1
a, 1
month,, 1
inhabited, 1
a, 1
small, 1
two-storied, 1
house, 1
behind, 1
Saint-Sulpice;, 1
there, 1
were, 1
two, 1
rooms, 1
on, 1
each, 1
floor, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
tenant., 1
The, 1
two, 1
lower, 1
rooms, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dining-room,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
chairs,, 1
and, 1
side-board, 1
of, 1
walnut,--and, 1
a, 1
wainscoted, 1
parlor,, 1
without, 1
ornaments,, 1
carpet,, 1
or, 1
timepiece., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
limited, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
objects, 1
of, 1
strict, 1
necessity., 1
He, 1
preferred, 1
to, 1
use, 1
the, 1
sitting-room, 1
upstairs,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
more, 1
library, 1
than, 1
parlor,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
furnished, 1
with, 1
theological, 1
books, 1
and, 1
parchments,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
bury, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
months, 1
at, 1
a, 1
time,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre., 1
His, 1
valet, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
visitors, 1
through, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
wicket;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
their, 1
faces, 1
were, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
him, 1
or, 1
displeased, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
replied, 1
that, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
an, 1
answer, 1
which, 1
satisfied, 1
most, 1
persons,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
known, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
great, 1
traveller., 1
Besides,, 1
whether, 1
at, 1
home, 1
or, 1
not,, 1
whether, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
or, 1
Cairo,, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
always, 1
left, 1
something, 1
to, 1
give, 1
away,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
distributed, 1
through, 1
this, 1
wicket, 1
in, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
name., 1
The, 1
other, 1
room, 1
near, 1
the, 1
library, 1
was, 1
a, 1
bedroom., 1
A, 1
bed, 1
without, 1
curtains,, 1
four, 1
arm-chairs,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
couch,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
yellow, 1
Utrecht, 1
velvet,, 1
composed,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
prie-Dieu,, 1
all, 1
its, 1
furniture., 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
resided, 1
in, 1
Rue, 1
Fontaine-Saint-George., 1
He, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
English, 1
tourists, 1
who, 1
consume, 1
a, 1
large, 1
fortune, 1
in, 1
travelling., 1
He, 1
hired, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
lived, 1
furnished,, 1
passed, 1
only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hours, 1
in, 1
the, 1
day, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
rarely, 1
slept, 1
there., 1
One, 1
of, 1
his, 1
peculiarities, 1
was, 1
never, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
French,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
however, 1
wrote, 1
with, 1
great, 1
facility.", 1
The, 1
day, 1
after, 1
this, 1
important, 1
information, 1
had, 1
been, 1
given, 1
to, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
alighted, 1
from, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Ferou,, 1
and, 1
rapping, 1
at, 1
an, 1
olive-green, 1
door,, 1
asked, 1
if, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
were, 1
within., 1
"No,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out, 1
early, 1
this, 1
morning,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
valet., 1
"I, 1
might, 1
not, 1
always, 1
be, 1
content, 1
with, 1
that, 1
answer,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
visitor,, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
come, 1
from, 1
one, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
everyone, 1
must, 1
be, 1
at, 1
home., 1
But, 1
have, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
to, 1
give, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni"--, 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
at, 1
home,", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
valet., 1
"Then, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return, 1
give, 1
him, 1
that, 1
card, 1
and, 1
this, 1
sealed, 1
paper., 1
Will, 1
he, 1
be, 1
at, 1
home, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
this, 1
evening?", 1
"Doubtless,, 1
unless, 1
he, 1
is, 1
at, 1
work,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
out.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
again, 1
at, 1
that, 1
time,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
visitor,, 1
who, 1
then, 1
retired., 1
At, 1
the, 1
appointed, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
same, 1
man, 1
returned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
carriage,, 1
which,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
stopping, 1
this, 1
time, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Ferou,, 1
drove, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
green, 1
door., 1
He, 1
knocked,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
opened, 1
immediately, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
him., 1
From, 1
the, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
respect, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
paid, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
his, 1
note, 1
had, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
good, 1
effect., 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
at, 1
home?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"Yes;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
at, 1
work, 1
in, 1
his, 1
library,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
expects, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
valet., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1
ascended, 1
a, 1
rough, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
before, 1
a, 1
table,, 1
illumined, 1
by, 1
a, 1
lamp, 1
whose, 1
light, 1
was, 1
concentrated, 1
by, 1
a, 1
large, 1
shade, 1
while, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
was, 1
in, 1
partial, 1
darkness,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
in, 1
a, 1
monk's, 1
dress,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cowl, 1
on, 1
his, 1
head, 1
such, 1
as, 1
was, 1
used, 1
by, 1
learned, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Middle, 1
Ages., 1
"Have, 1
I, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
addressing, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
visitor., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
person, 1
whom, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
formerly, 1
an, 1
inspector, 1
of, 1
prisons,, 1
sends, 1
to, 1
me, 1
from, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
of, 1
police?", 1
"Exactly,, 1
sir.", 1
"One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
agents, 1
appointed, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
the, 1
safety, 1
of, 1
Paris?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
with, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
hesitation,, 1
and, 1
blushing., 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
large, 1
spectacles,, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
not, 1
only, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
but, 1
his, 1
temples,, 1
and, 1
sitting, 1
down, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
visitor, 1
to, 1
do, 1
the, 1
same., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
marked, 1
Italian, 1
accent., 1
"The, 1
mission, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
charged,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
visitor,, 1
speaking, 1
with, 1
hesitation,, 1
"is, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
one, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
him, 1
who, 1
fulfils, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
him, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
is, 1
employed.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
bowed., 1
"Your, 1
probity,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
stranger,, 1
"is, 1
so, 1
well, 1
known, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
that, 1
he, 1
wishes, 1
as, 1
a, 1
magistrate, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
from, 1
you, 1
some, 1
particulars, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
public, 1
safety,, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
deputed, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you., 1
It, 1
is, 1
hoped, 1
that, 1
no, 1
ties, 1
of, 1
friendship, 1
or, 1
humane, 1
consideration, 1
will, 1
induce, 1
you, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
truth.", 1
"Provided,, 1
sir,, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
do, 1
not, 1
interfere, 1
with, 1
my, 1
scruples, 1
or, 1
my, 1
conscience., 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
priest,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
secrets, 1
of, 1
confession,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
must, 1
remain, 1
between, 1
me, 1
and, 1
God,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
between, 1
me, 1
and, 1
human, 1
justice.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
alarm, 1
yourself,, 1
monsieur,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
duly, 1
respect, 1
your, 1
conscience.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
pressed, 1
down, 1
his, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
and, 1
so, 1
raised, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
throwing, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
light, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stranger's, 1
face,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
own, 1
remained, 1
obscured., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
abbe,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
envoy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
of, 1
the, 1
police,, 1
"but, 1
the, 1
light, 1
tries, 1
my, 1
eyes, 1
very, 1
much.", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
lowered, 1
the, 1
shade., 1
"Now,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
listening--go, 1
on.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"You, 1
mean, 1
Monsieur, 1
Zaccone,, 1
I, 1
presume?", 1
"Zaccone?--is, 1
not, 1
his, 1
name, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
an, 1
estate,, 1
or,, 1
rather,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rock,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
a, 1
family, 1
name.", 1
"Well,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
so--let, 1
us, 1
not, 1
dispute, 1
about, 1
words;, 1
and, 1
since, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Zaccone, 1
are, 1
the, 1
same"--, 1
"Absolutely, 1
the, 1
same.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Zaccone.", 1
"Agreed.", 1
"I, 1
asked, 1
you, 1
if, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
him?", 1
"Extremely, 1
well.", 1
"Who, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"The, 1
son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
shipbuilder, 1
in, 1
Malta.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
report;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are, 1
aware,, 1
the, 1
police, 1
does, 1
not, 1
content, 1
itself, 1
with, 1
vague, 1
reports.", 1
"However,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
affable, 1
smile,, 1
"when, 1
that, 1
report, 1
is, 1
in, 1
accordance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
everybody, 1
must, 1
believe, 1
it,, 1
the, 1
police, 1

well, 1
as, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
what, 1
you, 1
assert?", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
that, 1
question?", 1
"Understand,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
suspect, 1
your, 1
veracity;, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
"I, 1
knew, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
M., 1
Zaccone.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1
"And, 1
when, 1
a, 1
child, 1
I, 1
often, 1
played, 1
with, 1
the, 1
son, 1
in, 1
the, 1
timber-yards.", 1
"But, 1
whence, 1
does, 1
he, 1
derive, 1
the, 1
title, 1
of, 1
count?", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
may, 1
be, 1
bought.", 1
"In, 1
Italy?", 1
"Everywhere.", 1
"And, 1
his, 1
immense, 1
riches,, 1
whence, 1
does, 1
he, 1
procure, 1
them?", 1
"They, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
so, 1
very, 1
great.", 1
"How, 1
much, 1
do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
he, 1
possesses?", 1
"From, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
to, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
livres, 1
per, 1
annum.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
reasonable,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
visitor;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
he, 1
had, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
millions.", 1
"Two, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
per, 1
annum, 1
would, 1
make, 1
four, 1
millions, 1
of, 1
capital.", 1

I, 1
was, 1
told, 1
he, 1
had, 1
four, 1
millions, 1
per, 1
annum.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
not, 1
probable.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"Certainly,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
who, 1
has, 1
come, 1
from, 1
Palermo,, 1
Naples,, 1
or, 1
Rome, 1
to, 1
France, 1
by, 1
sea, 1
must, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
has, 1
passed, 1
close, 1
to, 1
it, 1

must, 1
have, 1

it.", 1

am, 1
told, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
place?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
rock.", 1
"And, 1
why, 1
has, 1
the, 1
count, 1
bought, 1
a, 1
rock?", 1
"For, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
being, 1
a, 1
count., 1
In, 1
Italy, 1
one, 1
must, 1
have, 1
territorial, 1
possessions, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
count.", 1
"You, 1
have,, 1
doubtless,, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
adventures, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Zaccone's, 1
youth?", 1
"The, 1
father's?", 1
"No,, 1
the, 1
son's.", 1

know, 1
nothing, 1
certain;, 1
at, 1
that, 1
period, 1
of, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
I, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
my, 1
young, 1
comrade.", 1
"Was, 1
he, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wars?", 1

think, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
service.", 1

what, 1
branch?", 1

the, 1
navy.", 1

you, 1
not, 1
his, 1
confessor?", 1
"No,, 1
sir;, 1

he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
Lutheran.", 1

stopped, 1
at, 1
No., 1
5,, 1
where, 1
Lord, 1

lived., 1
The, 1
stranger, 1

to, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
requesting, 1
an, 1
interview,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
had, 1

for, 1
ten, 1
o'clock., 1
As, 1
the, 1
envoy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
of, 1
police, 1
arrived, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
before, 1
ten,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
told, 1
that, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
precision, 1
and, 1
punctuality, 1
personified,, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
come, 1
in,, 1

that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
return, 1
as, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck., 1
The, 1
visitor, 1
was, 1
introduced, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
like, 1
all, 1
other, 1
furnished, 1
drawing-rooms., 1
A, 1
mantle-piece,, 1
with, 1
two, 1
modern, 1
Sevres, 1
vases,, 1
a, 1
timepiece, 1
representing, 1
Cupid, 1
with, 1
his, 1
bent, 1
bow,, 1
a, 1
mirror, 1
with, 1
an, 1
engraving, 1
on, 1
each, 1
side--one, 1
representing, 1
Homer, 1
carrying, 1
his, 1
guide,, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
Belisarius, 1
begging--a, 1
grayish, 1
paper;, 1
red, 1
and, 1
black, 1
tapestry--such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore's, 1
drawing-room., 1
It, 1
was, 1
illuminated, 1
by, 1
lamps, 1
with, 1
ground-glass, 1
shades, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
only, 1
a, 1
feeble, 1
light,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
out, 1
of, 1
consideration, 1
for, 1
the, 1
envoy's, 1
weak, 1
sight., 1
After, 1
ten, 1
minutes', 1
expectation, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
ten;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
stroke, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore, 1
appeared., 1
He, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
above, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
height,, 1
with, 1
thin, 1
reddish, 1
whiskers,, 1
light, 1
complexion, 1
and, 1
light, 1
hair,, 1
turning, 1
rather, 1
gray., 1
He, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
English, 1
peculiarity,, 1
namely,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
coat,, 1
with, 1
gilt, 1
buttons, 1
and, 1
high, 1
collar,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fashion, 1
of, 1
1811,, 1
a, 1
white, 1
kerseymere, 1
waistcoat,, 1
and, 1
nankeen, 1
pantaloons,, 1
three, 1
inches, 1
too, 1
short,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
were, 1
prevented, 1
by, 1
straps, 1
from, 1
slipping, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
knee., 1
His, 1
first, 1
remark, 1
on, 1
entering, 1
was,--"You, 1
know,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
French?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1
converse, 1
in, 1
our, 1
language,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
envoy., 1
"But, 1
you, 1
may, 1
use, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore;, 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
it.", 1
"And, 1
I,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
visitor,, 1
changing, 1
his, 1
idiom,, 1
"know, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
English, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
the, 1
conversation., 1
Do, 1
not, 1
put, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
inconvenience.", 1
"Aw?", 1
said, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
is, 1
only, 1
known, 1
to, 1
natives, 1
of, 1
Great, 1
Britain., 1
The, 1
envoy, 1
presented, 1
his, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
introduction,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
read, 1
with, 1
English, 1
coolness,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
finished,--"I, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"perfectly.", 1
Then, 1
began, 1
the, 1
questions,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
those, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni., 1
But, 1
as, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
character, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
enemy,, 1
was, 1
less, 1
restrained, 1
in, 1
his, 1
answers,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
more, 1
numerous;, 1
he, 1
described, 1
the, 1
youth, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
who, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
service, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
petty, 1
sovereigns, 1
of, 1
India, 1
who, 1
make, 1
war, 1
on, 1
the, 1
English., 1
It, 1
was, 1
there, 1
Wilmore, 1
had, 1
first, 1
met, 1
him, 1
and, 1
fought, 1
against, 1
him;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
that, 1
war, 1
Zaccone, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
prisoner,, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
England,, 1
and, 1
consigned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hulks,, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
had, 1
escaped, 1
by, 1
swimming., 1
Then, 1
began, 1
his, 1
travels,, 1
his, 1
duels,, 1
his, 1
caprices;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
insurrection, 1
in, 1
Greece, 1
broke, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
served, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Grecian, 1
ranks., 1
While, 1
in, 1
that, 1
service, 1
he, 1
had, 1
discovered, 1
a, 1
silver, 1
mine, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mountains, 1
of, 1
Thessaly,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
careful, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
it, 1
from, 1
every, 1
one., 1
After, 1
the, 1
battle, 1
of, 1
Navarino,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
government, 1
was, 1
consolidated,, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
of, 1
King, 1
Otho, 1
a, 1
mining, 1
grant, 1
for, 1
that, 1
district,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
given, 1
him., 1
Hence, 1
that, 1
immense, 1
fortune,, 1
which,, 1
in, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore's, 1
opinion,, 1
possibly, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
one, 1
or, 1
two, 1
millions, 1
per, 1
annum,--a, 1
precarious, 1
fortune,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
be, 1
momentarily, 1
lost, 1
by, 1
the, 1
failure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mine., 1
"But,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
visitor,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
why, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
France?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
speculating, 1
in, 1
railways,", 1
said, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
"and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
is, 1
an, 1
expert, 1
chemist, 1
and, 1
physicist,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
invented, 1
a, 1
new, 1
system, 1
of, 1
telegraphy,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
is, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
to, 1
perfection.", 1
"How, 1
much, 1
does, 1
he, 1
spend, 1
yearly?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
prefect., 1
"Not, 1
more, 1
than, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs,", 1
said, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
miser.", 1
Hatred, 1
evidently, 1
inspired, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
who,, 1
knowing, 1
no, 1
other, 1
reproach, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
accused, 1
him, 1
of, 1
avarice., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
his, 1
house, 1
at, 1
Auteuil?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
respecting, 1
it?", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know, 1
why, 1
he, 1
bought, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"The, 1
count, 1
is, 1
a, 1
speculator,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
certainly, 1
ruin, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
experiments., 1
He, 1
supposes, 1
there, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
he, 1

being, 1
unsuccessful,, 1

will, 1
soon, 1
purchase, 1
all, 1

contiguous, 1
houses., 1

I, 1
dislike, 1

of, 1
your, 1
quarrel?", 1
"When, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
England, 1

seduced, 1
the, 1

one, 1
of, 1

you, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
revenge?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
fought, 1
three, 1
duels, 1
with, 1
him,", 1

the, 1
Englishman,, 1
"the, 1
first, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pistol,, 1

first, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
broke, 1
my, 1

he, 1
wounded, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
breast;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
third, 1

made, 1
this, 1

wound.", 1
The, 1
Englishman, 1
turned, 1
down, 1
his, 1
shirt-collar,, 1
and, 1
showed, 1
a, 1
scar,, 1
whose, 1
redness, 1
proved, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
recent, 1
one., 1
"So, 1
that,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
deadly, 1
feud, 1
between, 1
us.", 1

said, 1
the, 1
envoy,, 1
"you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
go, 1
about, 1
it, 1
in, 1

right, 1
way, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
him,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
you, 1
correctly.", 1
"Aw?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Englishman,, 1
"I, 1
practice, 1
shooting, 1
every, 1
day,, 1

every, 1

was, 1

visitor, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
ascertain,, 1

rather,, 1
all, 1

arose,, 1
and, 1

bowed, 1
to, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1

returned, 1
his, 1
salutation, 1
with, 1
the, 1
stiff, 1
politeness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
English,, 1
he, 1
retired., 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
door, 1
close, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bedroom,, 1
where, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
he, 1
pulled, 1
off, 1
his, 1
light, 1
hair,, 1
his, 1
red, 1
whiskers,, 1
his, 1
false, 1

procureur, 1
felt, 1
more, 1
at, 1
ease,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
nothing, 1
really, 1
satisfactory,, 1
and,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
since, 1
the, 1
dinner-party, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
he, 1
slept, 1
soundly., 1
Chapter, 1
70., 1
The, 1
Ball., 1
It, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
warmest, 1
days, 1
of, 1
July,, 1
when, 1
in, 1
due, 1
course, 1
of, 1
time, 1
the, 1
Saturday, 1
arrived, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
was, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place, 1
at, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf's., 1
It, 1
was, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
at, 1
night;, 1
the, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
the, 1
great, 1
trees, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
house, 1
stood, 1
out, 1
boldly, 1
against, 1
the, 1
azure, 1
canopy, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
studded, 1
with, 1
golden, 1
stars,, 1
but, 1
where, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fleeting, 1
clouds, 1
of, 1
a, 1
vanishing, 1
storm, 1
yet, 1
lingered., 1
From, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground-floor, 1
might, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
music,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
whirl, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waltz, 1
and, 1
galop,, 1
while, 1
brilliant, 1
streams, 1
of, 1
light, 1
shone, 1
through, 1
the, 1
openings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Venetian, 1
blinds., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
was, 1
only, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
servants,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
received, 1
orders, 1
from, 1
their, 1
mistress, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
the, 1
supper,, 1
the, 1
serenity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
weather, 1
continuing, 1
to, 1
increase., 1
Until, 1
now,, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
undecided, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
supper, 1
should, 1
take, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dining-room,, 1
or, 1
under, 1
a, 1
long, 1
tent, 1
erected, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lawn,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
blue, 1
sky,, 1
studded, 1
with, 1
stars,, 1
had, 1
settled, 1
the, 1
question, 1
in, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lawn., 1
The, 1
gardens, 1
were, 1
illuminated, 1
with, 1
colored, 1
lanterns,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
custom,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
usual, 1
in, 1
countries, 1
where, 1
the, 1
luxuries, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table--the, 1
rarest, 1
of, 1
all, 1
luxuries, 1
in, 1
their, 1
complete, 1
form--are, 1
well, 1
understood,, 1
the, 1
supper-table, 1
was, 1
loaded, 1
with, 1
wax-lights, 1
and, 1
flowers., 1
At, 1
the, 1
time, 1
the, 1
Countess, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rooms,, 1
after, 1
giving, 1
her, 1
orders,, 1
many, 1
guests, 1
were, 1
arriving,, 1
more, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
hospitality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
than, 1
by, 1
the, 1
distinguished, 1
position, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
for,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
good, 1
taste, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
one, 1
was, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
some, 1
devices, 1
at, 1
her, 1
entertainment, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
describing,, 1
or, 1
even, 1
copying, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
need., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
events, 1
we, 1
have, 1
related, 1
had, 1
caused, 1
deep, 1
anxiety,, 1
had, 1
hesitated, 1
about, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's,, 1
when, 1
during, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
her, 1
carriage, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Villefort., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
the, 1
carriages, 1
had, 1
drawn, 1
close, 1
together,, 1
said,--"You, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
too, 1
ill.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
wrong,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
significantly;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
important, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
there.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
two, 1
carriages, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
towards, 1
their, 1
different, 1
destinations., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
therefore, 1
came,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
beautiful, 1
in, 1
person,, 1
but, 1
radiant, 1
with, 1
splendor;, 1
she, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
one, 1
door, 1
at, 1
the, 1
time, 1
when, 1
Mercedes, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
countess, 1
took, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
He, 1
approached,, 1
paid, 1
her, 1
some, 1
well, 1
merited, 1
compliments, 1
on, 1
her, 1
toilet,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
her, 1
to, 1
a, 1
seat., 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
my, 1
daughter?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
smiling., 1
"I, 1
confess, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
"Could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
cruel, 1
as, 1
not, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
her?", 1
"Calm, 1
yourself., 1
She, 1
has, 1
met, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
her, 1
arm;, 1
see,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
following, 1
us,, 1
both, 1
in, 1
white, 1
dresses,, 1
one, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bouquet, 1
of, 1
camellias,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
myosotis., 1
But, 1
tell, 1
me"--, 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know?", 1
"Will, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
be, 1
here, 1
to-night?", 1
"Seventeen!", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"I, 1
only, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seems, 1
the, 1
rage,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
viscount,, 1
smiling,, 1
"and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
seventeenth, 1
person, 1
that, 1
has, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
the, 1
same, 1
question., 1
The, 1
count, 1
is, 1
in, 1
fashion;, 1
I, 1
congratulate, 1
him, 1
upon, 1
it.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
replied, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one, 1
as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"Ah,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sure,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
answered, 1
you;, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1

shall, 1
have, 1
this, 1
'lion;', 1

are, 1
among, 1
the, 1
privileged, 1
ones.", 1
"Were, 1
you, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
yesterday?", 1
"No.", 1
"He, 1
was, 1
there.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?, 1
And, 1
did, 1
the, 1
eccentric, 1
person, 1
commit, 1
any, 1
new, 1
originality?", 1
"Can, 1
he, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
without, 1
doing, 1
so?, 1
Elssler, 1

dancing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
'Diable, 1
Boiteux;', 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
princess, 1
was, 1
in, 1
ecstasies., 1
After, 1
the, 1
cachucha, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
ring, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stem, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bouquet,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
danseuse,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
third, 1
act,, 1
to, 1
do, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
the, 1

with, 1
it, 1
on, 1
her, 1
finger., 1
And, 1
the, 1
Greek, 1
princess,--will, 1
she, 1
be, 1
here?", 1
"No,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
deprived, 1
of, 1
that, 1
pleasure;, 1
her, 1
position, 1
in, 1

"Wait;, 1

me, 1
here,, 1

lips, 1
opened, 1
as, 1

approached., 1
"I, 1
wager, 1
anything,", 1

Albert,, 1
interrupting, 1
her,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
you, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
say.", 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"If, 1
I, 1
guess, 1
rightly,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
confess, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"On, 1
your, 1
honor?", 1
"On, 1
my, 1
honor.", 1

tell, 1
you?", 1

he, 1
was, 1
leaving, 1

being, 1
too, 1
rich.", 1
"Indeed,, 1
that, 1
doubtless, 1
would, 1
have, 1
happened, 1
if, 1
his, 1
credentials, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
so, 1
favorable.", 1
"Poor, 1
count!, 1
And, 1
is, 1
he, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
the, 1
danger, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
in?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
not.", 1
"Then, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
but, 1
charitable, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
him., 1
When, 1
he, 1
arrives,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
fail, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
Just, 1
then,, 1
a, 1
handsome, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
with, 1
bright, 1
eyes,, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
glossy, 1
mustache,, 1
respectfully, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
Albert, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
present, 1
to, 1
you, 1
M., 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
Spahis,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
our, 1
best,, 1
and,, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
of, 1
our, 1
bravest, 1
officers.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
had, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
meeting, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
turning, 1
away, 1
with, 1
marked, 1
coldness, 1
of, 1
manner., 1
This, 1
answer,, 1
and, 1
especially, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
uttered,, 1
chilled, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Morrel., 1
But, 1
a, 1
recompense, 1
was, 1
in, 1
store, 1
for, 1
him;, 1
turning, 1
around,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
near, 1
the, 1
door, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
fair, 1
face,, 1
whose, 1
large, 1
blue, 1
eyes, 1
were,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
marked, 1
expression,, 1
fixed, 1
upon, 1
him,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
bouquet, 1
of, 1
myosotis, 1
was, 1
gently, 1
raised, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
The, 1
salutation, 1
was, 1
so, 1
well, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
expression, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
handkerchief, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mouth;, 1
and, 1
these, 1
two, 1
living, 1
statues,, 1
whose, 1
hearts, 1
beat, 1
so, 1
violently, 1
under, 1
their, 1
marble, 1
aspect,, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
each, 1
other, 1
by, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
length, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
forgot, 1
themselves, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
forgot, 1
the, 1
world, 1
in, 1
their, 1
mutual, 1
contemplation., 1
They, 1
might, 1
have, 1
remained, 1
much, 1
longer, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
one, 1
noticing, 1
their, 1
abstraction., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
just, 1
entered., 1
We, 1
have, 1
already, 1
said, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count, 1
which, 1
attracted, 1
universal, 1
attention, 1
wherever, 1
he, 1
appeared., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
coat,, 1
unexceptional, 1
in, 1
its, 1
cut,, 1
though, 1
simple, 1
and, 1
unornamented;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
plain, 1
white, 1
waistcoat;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
trousers,, 1
that, 1
displayed, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
so, 1
perfectly, 1
formed--it, 1
was, 1
none, 1
of, 1
these, 1
things, 1
that, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
attention,--it, 1
was, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
complexion,, 1
his, 1
waving, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
his, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
serene, 1
expression,, 1
his, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
melancholy, 1
eye,, 1
his, 1
mouth,, 1
chiselled, 1
with, 1
such, 1
marvellous, 1
delicacy,, 1
which, 1
so, 1
easily, 1
expressed, 1
such, 1
high, 1
disdain,--these, 1
were, 1
what, 1
fixed, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
all, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
Many, 1
men, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
handsomer,, 1
but, 1
certainly, 1
there, 1
could, 1
be, 1
none, 1
whose, 1
appearance, 1
was, 1
more, 1
significant,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
may, 1
be, 1
used., 1
Everything, 1
about, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
its, 1
meaning,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
constant, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
thought, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
acquired, 1
had, 1
given, 1
an, 1
ease, 1
and, 1
vigor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
to, 1
the, 1
most, 1
trifling, 1
gesture,, 1
scarcely, 1
to, 1
be, 1
understood., 1
Yet, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
world, 1
is, 1
so, 1
strange,, 1
that, 1
even, 1
all, 1
this, 1
might, 1
not, 1
have, 1
won, 1
attention, 1
had, 1
there, 1
not, 1
been, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
it, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
story, 1
gilded, 1
by, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
fortune., 1
Meanwhile, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
through, 1
the, 1
assemblage, 1
of, 1
guests, 1
under, 1
a, 1
battery, 1
of, 1
curious, 1
glances, 1
towards, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who,, 1
standing, 1
before, 1
a, 1
mantle-piece, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
flowers,, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
entrance, 1
in, 1
a, 1
looking-glass, 1
placed, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him., 1
She, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
serene, 1
smile, 1
just, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
was, 1
bowing, 1
to, 1
her., 1
No, 1
doubt, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
the, 1
count, 1
would, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
while, 1
on, 1
his, 1
side, 1
the, 1
count, 1
thought, 1
she, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
address, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
both, 1
remained, 1
silent,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
bow,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
directed, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
received, 1
him, 1
cordially., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
seen, 1
my, 1
mother?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
had, 1
the, 1
pleasure,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
your, 1
father.", 1
"See,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
down, 1
there,, 1
talking, 1
politics, 1
with, 1
that, 1
little, 1
group, 1
of, 1
great, 1
geniuses.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"and, 1
so, 1
those, 1
gentlemen, 1
down, 1
there, 1
are, 1
men, 1
of, 1
great, 1
talent., 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
guessed, 1
it., 1
And, 1
for, 1
what, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
talent, 1
are, 1
they, 1
celebrated?, 1
You, 1
know, 1
there, 1
are, 1
different, 1
sorts.", 1
"That, 1
tall,, 1
harsh-looking, 1
man, 1
is, 1
very, 1
learned,, 1
he, 1
discovered,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
neighborhood, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
lizard, 1
with, 1
a, 1
vertebra, 1
more, 1
than, 1
lizards, 1
usually, 1
have,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
immediately, 1
laid, 1
his, 1
discovery, 1
before, 1
the, 1
Institute., 1
The, 1
thing, 1
was, 1
discussed, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
finally, 1
decided, 1
in, 1
his, 1
favor., 1
I, 1
can, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
the, 1
vertebra, 1
made, 1
a, 1
great, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
learned, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gentleman,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
knight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor,, 1
was, 1
made, 1
an, 1
officer.", 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"this, 1
cross, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
wisely, 1
awarded., 1
I, 1
suppose,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
found, 1
another, 1
additional, 1
vertebra,, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
made, 1
him, 1
a, 1
commander.", 1
"Very, 1
likely,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"And, 1
who, 1
can, 1
that, 1
person, 1
be, 1
who, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
it, 1
into, 1
his, 1

to, 1

green?", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
coat, 1
is, 1
not, 1

what, 1
is, 1
his, 1
especial, 1
talent?", 1
"His, 1
talent?, 1
I, 1
believe, 1
he, 1
thrusts, 1
pins, 1
through, 1
the, 1
heads, 1
of, 1
rabbits,, 1

makes, 1
fowls, 1

out, 1

"I, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you., 1

seems"--, 1
"That, 1
his, 1
experiments, 1
have, 1
very, 1
considerably, 1
advanced, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
science,, 1
doubtless?", 1
"No;, 1
that, 1
his, 1
style, 1
of, 1

is, 1
very, 1
good.", 1

not, 1
mention, 1
these, 1
things,", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
then,, 1
approaching, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"especially, 1
before, 1
young, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti;", 1
after, 1
which, 1
he, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
in, 1
question., 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
converse, 1
with, 1
young, 1
Cavalcanti;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
alone., 1
Meanwhile, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
became, 1
excessive., 1
The, 1
footmen, 1
were, 1
hastening, 1
through, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
with, 1
waiters, 1
loaded, 1
with, 1
ices., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
but, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
when, 1
the, 1
waiter, 1
was, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
took, 1
no, 1
refreshment., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
took, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
noticed, 1
his, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
refusal., 1
"Albert,", 1
she, 1
asked,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
notice, 1
that?", 1
"What,, 1
mother?", 1
"That, 1
the, 1
count, 1
has, 1
never, 1
been, 1
willing, 1
to, 1
partake, 1
of, 1
food, 1
under, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
then, 1
he, 1
breakfasted, 1
with, 1
me--indeed,, 1
he, 1
made, 1
his, 1
first, 1
appearance, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
on, 1
that, 1
occasion.", 1
"But, 1
your, 1
house, 1
is, 1
not, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf's,", 1
murmured, 1
Mercedes;, 1
"and, 1
since, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
here, 1
I, 1
have, 1
watched, 1
him.", 1
"Well?", 1
"Well,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
nothing, 1
yet.", 1
"The, 1
count, 1
is, 1
very, 1
temperate.", 1
Mercedes, 1
smiled, 1
sadly., 1
"Approach, 1
him,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"and, 1
when, 1
the, 1
next, 1
waiter, 1
passes,, 1
insist, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
taking, 1
something.", 1
"But, 1
why,, 1
mother?", 1
"Just, 1
to, 1
please, 1
me,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes., 1
Albert, 1
kissed, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Another, 1
salver, 1
passed,, 1
loaded, 1
like, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
ones;, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
Albert, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
persuade, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
obstinately, 1
refused., 1
Albert, 1
rejoined, 1
his, 1
mother;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
very, 1
pale., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"you, 1
see, 1
he, 1
refuses?", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
why, 1
need, 1
this, 1
annoy, 1
you?", 1
"You, 1
know,, 1
Albert,, 1
women, 1
are, 1
singular, 1
creatures., 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
count, 1
take, 1
something, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
if, 1
only, 1
an, 1
ice., 1
Perhaps, 1
he, 1
cannot, 1
reconcile, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
French, 1
style, 1
of, 1
living,, 1
and, 1
might, 1
prefer, 1
something, 1
else.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
eat, 1
of, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
Italy;, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
feel, 1
inclined, 1
this, 1
evening.", 1
"And, 1
besides,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
"accustomed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
is, 1
to, 1
burning, 1
climates,, 1
possibly, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
as, 1
we, 1
do.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
that,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
has, 1
complained, 1
of, 1
feeling, 1
almost, 1
suffocated,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
why, 1
the, 1
Venetian, 1
blinds, 1
were, 1
not, 1
opened, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
windows.", 1
"In, 1
a, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
way, 1
of, 1
assuring, 1
me, 1
that, 1
his, 1
abstinence, 1
was, 1
intended.", 1
And, 1
she, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
A, 1
minute, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
blinds, 1
were, 1
thrown, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
through, 1
the, 1
jessamine, 1
and, 1
clematis, 1
that, 1
overhung, 1
the, 1
window, 1
one, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
lanterns,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
supper, 1
laid, 1
under, 1
the, 1
tent., 1
Dancers,, 1
players,, 1
talkers,, 1
all, 1
uttered, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
joy--every, 1
one, 1
inhaled, 1
with, 1
delight, 1
the, 1
breeze, 1
that, 1
floated, 1
in., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
Mercedes, 1
reappeared,, 1
paler, 1
than, 1
before,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
that, 1
imperturbable, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
countenance, 1
which, 1
she, 1
sometimes, 1
wore., 1
She, 1
went, 1
straight, 1
to, 1
the, 1
group, 1
of, 1
which, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
centre., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
detain, 1
those, 1
gentlemen, 1
here,, 1
count,", 1
she, 1
said;, 1
"they, 1
would, 1
prefer,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
think,, 1
to, 1
breathe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
suffocate, 1
here,, 1
since, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not, 1
playing.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
gallant, 1
old, 1
general,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
1809,, 1
had, 1
sung, 1
"Partant, 1
pour, 1
la, 1
Syrie,"--"we, 1
will, 1
not, 1
go, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
lead, 1
the, 1
way.", 1
Turning, 1
towards, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
she, 1
added,, 1
"count,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
oblige, 1
me, 1
with, 1
your, 1
arm?", 1
The, 1
count, 1
almost, 1
staggered, 1
at, 1
these, 1
simple, 1
words;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
Mercedes., 1
It, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
momentary, 1
glance,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
to, 1
have, 1
lasted, 1
for, 1
a, 1
century,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
was, 1
expressed, 1
in, 1
that, 1
one, 1
look., 1
He, 1
offered, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
the, 1
countess;, 1
she, 1
took, 1
it,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
just, 1
touched, 1
it, 1
with, 1
her, 1
little, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
together, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
lined, 1
with, 1
rhododendrons, 1
and, 1
camellias., 1
Behind, 1
them,, 1
by, 1
another, 1
outlet,, 1
a, 1
group, 1
of, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
persons, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
with, 1
loud, 1
exclamations, 1
of, 1
delight., 1
Chapter, 1
71., 1
Bread, 1
and, 1
Salt., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
entered, 1
an, 1
archway, 1
of, 1
trees, 1
with, 1
her, 1
companion., 1
It, 1
led, 1
through, 1
a, 1
grove, 1
of, 1
lindens, 1
to, 1
a, 1
conservatory., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
too, 1
warm, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
was, 1
it, 1
not,, 1
count?", 1
she, 1
asked., 1
"Yes,, 1
madame;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
yours, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
and, 1
the, 1
blinds.", 1
As, 1
he, 1
ceased, 1
speaking,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Mercedes, 1
tremble., 1
"But, 1
you,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"with, 1
that, 1
light, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
cover, 1
you, 1
but, 1
that, 1
gauze, 1
scarf,, 1
perhaps, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
cold?", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
where, 1
I, 1
am, 1
leading, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
without, 1
replying, 1
to, 1
the, 1
question., 1
"No,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
make, 1
no, 1
resistance.", 1
"We, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
greenhouse, 1
that, 1
you, 1
see, 1
at, 1
the, 1
other, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grove.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Mercedes, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
interrogate, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
on, 1
in, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
refrained, 1
from, 1
speaking., 1
They, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
building,, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
magnificent, 1
fruits,, 1
which, 1
ripen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
July, 1
in, 1
the, 1
artificial, 1
temperature, 1
which, 1
takes, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun,, 1
so, 1
frequently, 1
absent, 1
in, 1
our, 1
climate., 1
The, 1
countess, 1
left, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
gathered, 1
a, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
Muscatel, 1
grapes., 1
"See,, 1
count,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
so, 1
sad, 1
in, 1
its, 1
expression, 1
that, 1
one, 1
could, 1
almost, 1
detect, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
on, 1
her, 1
eyelids--"see,, 1
our, 1
French, 1
grapes, 1
are, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
compared,, 1
I, 1
know,, 1
with, 1
yours, 1
of, 1
Sicily, 1
and, 1
Cyprus,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
will, 1
make, 1
allowance, 1
for, 1
our, 1
northern, 1
sun.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed,, 1
but, 1
stepped, 1
back., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
refuse?", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tremulous, 1
voice., 1
"Pray, 1
excuse, 1
me,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
never, 1
eat, 1
Muscatel, 1
grapes.", 1
Mercedes, 1
let, 1
them, 1
fall,, 1
and, 1
sighed., 1
A, 1
magnificent, 1
peach, 1
was, 1
hanging, 1
against, 1
an, 1
adjoining, 1
wall,, 1
ripened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
same, 1
artificial, 1
heat., 1
Mercedes, 1
drew, 1
near,, 1
and, 1
plucked, 1
the, 1
fruit., 1
"Take, 1
this, 1
peach,, 1
then,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
The, 1
count, 1
again, 1
refused., 1
"What,, 1
again?", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
in, 1
so, 1
plaintive, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
stifle, 1
a, 1
sob;, 1
"really,, 1
you, 1
pain, 1
me.", 1
A, 1
long, 1
silence, 1
followed;, 1
the, 1
peach,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
grapes,, 1
fell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
"Count,", 1
added, 1
Mercedes, 1
with, 1
a, 1
supplicating, 1
glance,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
Arabian, 1
custom,, 1
which, 1
makes, 1
eternal, 1
friends, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
together, 1
eaten, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
salt, 1
under, 1
the, 1
same, 1
roof.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"but, 1
we, 1
are, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
in, 1
Arabia,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
France, 1
eternal, 1
friendships, 1
are, 1
as, 1
rare, 1
as, 1
the, 1
custom, 1
of, 1
dividing, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
salt, 1
with, 1
one, 1
another.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
breathlessly,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
whose, 1
arm, 1
she, 1
convulsively, 1
pressed, 1
with, 1
both, 1
hands,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
friends,, 1
are, 1
we, 1
not?", 1
The, 1
count, 1
became, 1
pale, 1
as, 1
death,, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
rushed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
again, 1
rising,, 1
dyed, 1
his, 1
cheeks, 1
with, 1
crimson;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
swam, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
suddenly, 1
dazzled., 1
"Certainly,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
friends,", 1
he, 1
replied;, 1
"why, 1
should, 1
we, 1
not, 1
be?", 1
The, 1
answer, 1
was, 1
so, 1
little, 1
like, 1
the, 1
one, 1
Mercedes, 1
desired,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
to, 1
give, 1
vent, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
which, 1
sounded, 1
more, 1
like, 1
a, 1
groan., 1
"Thank, 1
you,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
And, 1
they, 1
walked, 1
on, 1
again., 1
They, 1
went, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
length, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word., 1
"Sir,", 1
suddenly, 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
after, 1
their, 1
walk, 1
had, 1
continued, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
in, 1
silence,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
true, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
so, 1
much,, 1
travelled, 1
so, 1
far,, 1
and, 1
suffered, 1
so, 1
deeply?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
deeply,, 1
madame,", 1
answered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"But, 1
now, 1
you, 1
are, 1
happy?", 1
"Doubtless,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"since, 1
no, 1
one, 1
hears, 1
me, 1
complain.", 1
"And, 1
your, 1
present, 1
happiness,, 1
has, 1
it, 1
softened, 1
your, 1
heart?", 1
"My, 1
present, 1
happiness, 1
equals, 1
my, 1
past, 1
misery,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
married?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
"I,, 1
married?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
shuddering;, 1
"who, 1
could, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you, 1
so?", 1
"No, 1
one, 1
told, 1
me, 1
you, 1
were,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
have, 1
frequently, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
with, 1
a, 1
young, 1
and, 1
lovely, 1
woman.", 1
"She, 1
is, 1
a, 1
slave, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
bought, 1
at, 1
Constantinople,, 1
madame,, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prince., 1
I, 1
have, 1
adopted, 1
her, 1

my, 1
daughter,, 1

no, 1

else, 1
to, 1
love, 1
in, 1
the, 1

"You, 1
live, 1
alone,, 1
then?", 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
no, 1
sister--no, 1
son--no, 1
father?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
one.", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
you, 1
exist, 1
thus, 1
without, 1
any, 1
one, 1
to, 1
attach, 1
you, 1
to, 1
life?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
fault,, 1
madame., 1
At, 1
Malta,, 1
I, 1
loved, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
her,, 1
when, 1
war, 1
came, 1
and, 1
carried, 1
me, 1
away., 1
I, 1
thought, 1
she, 1
loved, 1
me, 1
well, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
faithful, 1
to, 1
my, 1
memory., 1
When, 1
I, 1
returned, 1
she, 1
was, 1
married., 1
This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
most, 1
men, 1
who, 1
have, 1
passed, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age., 1
Perhaps, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
weaker, 1
than, 1
the, 1
hearts, 1
of, 1
most, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
suffered, 1
more, 1
than, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
in, 1
my, 1
place;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
The, 1
countess, 1
stopped, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
gasping, 1
for, 1
breath., 1
"Yes,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
have, 1
still, 1
preserved, 1
this, 1
love, 1
in, 1
your, 1
heart--one, 1
can, 1
only, 1
love, 1
once--and, 1
did, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
see, 1
her, 1
again?", 1
"Never.", 1
"Never?", 1
"I, 1
never, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
country, 1
where, 1
she, 1
lived.", 1
"To, 1
Malta?", 1
"Yes;, 1
Malta.", 1
"She, 1
is,, 1
then,, 1
now, 1
at, 1
Malta?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
so.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
forgiven, 1
her, 1
for, 1
all, 1
she, 1
has, 1
made, 1
you, 1
suffer?", 1
"Her,--yes.", 1
"But, 1
only, 1
her;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
then, 1
still, 1
hate, 1
those, 1
who, 1
separated, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
hate, 1
them?, 1
Not, 1
at, 1
all;, 1
why, 1
should, 1
I?", 1
The, 1
countess, 1
placed, 1
herself, 1
before, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
still, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
perfumed, 1
grapes., 1
"Take, 1
some,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
"Madame,, 1
I, 1
never, 1
eat, 1
Muscatel, 1
grapes,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
mentioned, 1
before., 1
The, 1
countess, 1
dashed, 1
the, 1
grapes, 1
into, 1
the, 1
nearest, 1
thicket,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
despair., 1
"Inflexible, 1
man!", 1
she, 1
murmured., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
remained, 1
as, 1
unmoved, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
reproach, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Albert, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
ran, 1
in., 1
"Oh,, 1
mother,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"such, 1
a, 1
misfortune, 1
has, 1
happened!", 1
"What?, 1
What, 1
has, 1
happened?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
awakening, 1
from, 1
a, 1
sleep, 1
to, 1
the, 1
realities, 1
of, 1
life;, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
say, 1
a, 1
misfortune?, 1
Indeed,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
expect, 1
misfortunes.", 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
here.", 1
"Well?", 1
"He, 1
comes, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
daughter.", 1
"Why, 1
so?", 1
"Because, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
is, 1
just, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
bringing, 1
the, 1
news, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
death,, 1
which, 1
took, 1
place, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
stage, 1
after, 1
he, 1
left, 1
Marseilles., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
very, 1
good, 1
spirits,, 1
would, 1
neither, 1
believe, 1
nor, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
misfortune,, 1
but, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
words,, 1
guessed, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
truth,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
all, 1
the, 1
precautions, 1
of, 1
her, 1
father;, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
struck, 1
her, 1
like, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
senseless.", 1
"And, 1
how, 1
was, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
related, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"He, 1
was, 1
her, 1
grandfather, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mother's, 1
side., 1
He, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
here, 1
to, 1
hasten, 1
her, 1
marriage, 1
with, 1
Franz.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1
"So, 1
Franz, 1
must, 1
wait., 1
Why, 1
was, 1
not, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
also, 1
grandfather, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Albert,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
mild, 1
reproof,, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
saying?, 1
Ah,, 1
count,, 1
he, 1
esteems, 1
you, 1
so, 1
highly,, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
spoken, 1
amiss.", 1
And, 1
she, 1
took, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
steps, 1
forward., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
so, 1
thoughtful,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
full, 1
of, 1
affectionate, 1
admiration,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
back, 1
and, 1
grasped, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
she, 1
seized, 1
that, 1
of, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
joined, 1
them, 1
together., 1
"We, 1
are, 1
friends;, 1
are, 1
we, 1
not?", 1
she, 1
asked., 1
"Oh,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
presume, 1
to, 1
call, 1
myself, 1
your, 1
friend,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
all, 1
times, 1
I, 1
am, 1
your, 1
most, 1
respectful, 1
servant.", 1
The, 1
countess, 1
left, 1
with, 1
an, 1
indescribable, 1
pang, 1
in, 1
her, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
before, 1
she, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
ten, 1
steps, 1
the, 1
count, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
raise, 1
her, 1
handkerchief, 1
to, 1
her, 1
eyes., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
you, 1
agree?", 1
asked, 1
Albert,, 1
astonished., 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
her, 1
declare, 1
that, 1
we, 1
were, 1
friends?", 1
They, 1
re-entered, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
just, 1
quitted., 1
It, 1
is, 1
perhaps, 1
needless, 1
to, 1
add, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
departed, 1
almost, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time., 1
Chapter, 1
72., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran., 1
A, 1
gloomy, 1
scene, 1
had, 1
indeed, 1
just, 1
passed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
After, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
had, 1
departed, 1
for, 1
the, 1
ball,, 1
whither, 1
all, 1
the, 1
entreaties, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
in, 1
persuading, 1
him, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
them,, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
had, 1
shut, 1
himself, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
his, 1
custom,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
heap, 1
of, 1
papers, 1
calculated, 1
to, 1
alarm, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
generally, 1
scarcely, 1
satisfied, 1
his, 1
inordinate, 1
desires., 1
But, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
were, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
form., 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
secluded, 1
himself,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
study,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
reflect;, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
door, 1
locked, 1
and, 1
orders, 1
given, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
not, 1
be, 1
disturbed, 1
excepting, 1
for, 1
important, 1
business,, 1
he, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arm-chair, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
ponder, 1
over, 1
the, 1
events,, 1
the, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
which, 1
had, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
eight, 1
days, 1
filled, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
with, 1
so, 1
many, 1
gloomy, 1
thoughts, 1
and, 1
bitter, 1
recollections., 1
Then,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
plunging, 1
into, 1
the, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
documents, 1
piled, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
drawer, 1
of, 1
his, 1
desk,, 1
touched, 1
a, 1
spring,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
a, 1
parcel, 1
of, 1
cherished, 1
memoranda,, 1
amongst, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
carefully, 1
arranged,, 1
in, 1
characters, 1
only, 1
known, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
the, 1
names, 1
of, 1
all, 1
those, 1
who,, 1
either, 1
in, 1
his, 1
political, 1
career,, 1
in, 1
money, 1
matters,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bar,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mysterious, 1
love, 1
affairs,, 1
had, 1
become, 1
his, 1
enemies., 1
Their, 1
number, 1
was, 1
formidable,, 1
now, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
begun, 1
to, 1
fear,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
these, 1
names,, 1
powerful, 1
though, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
had, 1
often, 1
caused, 1
him, 1
to, 1
smile, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
satisfaction, 1
experienced, 1
by, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
who, 1
from, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mountain, 1
beholds, 1
at, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
the, 1
craggy, 1
eminences,, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
impassable, 1
paths,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fearful, 1
chasms,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
he, 1
has, 1
so, 1
perilously, 1
climbed., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
run, 1
over, 1
all, 1
these, 1
names, 1
in, 1
his, 1
memory,, 1
again, 1
read, 1
and, 1
studied, 1
them,, 1
commenting, 1
meanwhile, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
lists,, 1
he, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"No,", 1
he, 1
murmured,, 1
"none, 1
of, 1
my, 1
enemies, 1
would, 1
have, 1
waited, 1
so, 1
patiently, 1
and, 1
laboriously, 1
for, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
space, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
now, 1
come, 1
and, 1
crush, 1
me, 1
with, 1
this, 1
secret., 1
Sometimes,, 1
as, 1
Hamlet, 1
says--, 1
'Foul, 1
deeds, 1
will, 1
rise,, 1
Tho', 1
all, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
o'erwhelm, 1
them, 1
to, 1
men's, 1
eyes;', 1
but,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
phosphoric, 1
light,, 1
they, 1
rise, 1
but, 1
to, 1
mislead., 1
The, 1
story, 1
has, 1
been, 1
told, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Corsican, 1
to, 1
some, 1
priest,, 1
who, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
has, 1
repeated, 1
it., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
may, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
enlighten, 1
himself--but, 1
why, 1
should, 1
he, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
enlighten, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
subject?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
reflection,, 1
"what, 1
interest, 1
can, 1
this, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
or, 1
M., 1
Zaccone,--son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
shipowner, 1
of, 1
Malta,, 1
discoverer, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mine, 1
in, 1
Thessaly,, 1
now, 1
visiting, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time,--what, 1
interest,, 1
I, 1
say,, 1
can, 1
he, 1
take, 1
in, 1
discovering, 1
a, 1
gloomy,, 1
mysterious,, 1
and, 1
useless, 1
fact, 1
like, 1
this?, 1
However,, 1
among, 1
all, 1
the, 1
incoherent, 1
details, 1
given, 1
to, 1
me, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
and, 1
by, 1
Lord, 1
Wilmore,, 1
by, 1
that, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
that, 1
enemy,, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
appears, 1
certain, 1
and, 1
clear, 1
in, 1
my, 1
opinion--that, 1
in, 1
no, 1
period,, 1
in, 1
no, 1
case,, 1
in, 1
no, 1
circumstance,, 1
could, 1
there, 1
have, 1
been, 1
any, 1
contact, 1
between, 1
him, 1
and, 1
me.", 1
But, 1
Villefort, 1
uttered, 1
words, 1
which, 1
even, 1
he, 1
himself, 1
did, 1
not, 1
believe., 1
He, 1
dreaded, 1
not, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
revelation,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
could, 1
reply, 1
to, 1
or, 1
deny, 1
its, 1
truth;--he, 1
cared, 1
little, 1
for, 1
that, 1
mene,, 1
tekel,, 1
upharsin,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
suddenly, 1
in, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
wall;--but, 1
what, 1
he, 1
was, 1
really, 1
anxious, 1
for, 1
was, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
whose, 1
hand, 1
had, 1
traced, 1
them., 1
While, 1
he, 1
was, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
calm, 1
his, 1
fears,--and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
dwelling, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
political, 1
future, 1
that, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
been, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
his, 1
ambitious, 1
dreams,, 1
was, 1
imagining, 1
a, 1
future, 1
limited, 1
to, 1
the, 1
enjoyments, 1
of, 1
home,, 1
in, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
awakening, 1
the, 1
enemy, 1
that, 1
had, 1
so, 1
long, 1
slept,--the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
sounded, 1
in, 1
the, 1
yard,, 1
then, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
an, 1
aged, 1
person, 1
ascending, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
tears, 1
and, 1
lamentations,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
servants, 1
always, 1
give, 1
vent, 1
to, 1
when, 1
they, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
their, 1
master's, 1
grief., 1
He, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
the, 1
bolt, 1
of, 1
his, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
directly, 1
an, 1
old, 1
lady, 1
entered,, 1
unannounced,, 1
carrying, 1
her, 1
shawl, 1
on, 1
her, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
bonnet, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
white, 1
hair, 1
was, 1
thrown, 1
back, 1
from, 1
her, 1
yellow, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
already, 1
sunken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
furrows, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
now, 1
almost, 1
disappeared, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
eyelids, 1
swollen, 1
with, 1
grief., 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
she, 1
said;, 1
"oh,, 1
sir,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
misfortune!, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
die, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
oh,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
certainly, 1
die, 1
of, 1
it!", 1
And, 1
then,, 1
falling, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
chair, 1
nearest, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
she, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
sobs., 1
The, 1
servants,, 1
standing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
doorway,, 1
not, 1
daring, 1
to, 1
approach, 1
nearer,, 1
were, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
Noirtier's, 1
old, 1
servant,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
from, 1
his, 1
master's, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
run, 1
there, 1
also,, 1
remaining, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
others., 1
Villefort, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
mother-in-law,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
she., 1
"Why,, 1
what, 1
can, 1
have, 1
happened?", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"what, 1
has, 1
thus, 1
disturbed, 1
you?, 1
Is, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
is, 1
dead,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
old, 1
marchioness,, 1
without, 1
preface, 1
and, 1
without, 1
expression;, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
stupefied., 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
together,, 1
exclaimed--"Dead!--so, 1
suddenly?", 1
"A, 1
week, 1
ago,", 1
continued, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
"we, 1
went, 1
out, 1
together, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
after, 1
dinner., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unwell, 1
for, 1
some, 1
days;, 1
still,, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
our, 1
dear, 1
Valentine, 1
again, 1
inspired, 1
him, 1
with, 1
courage,, 1
and, 1
notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
illness, 1
he, 1
would, 1
leave., 1
At, 1
six, 1
leagues, 1
from, 1
Marseilles,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
eaten, 1
some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lozenges, 1
he, 1
is, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
take,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
such, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
sleep,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
me, 1
unnatural;, 1
still, 1
I, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
wake, 1
him,, 1
although, 1
I, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
his, 1
face, 1
was, 1
flushed,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
veins, 1
of, 1
his, 1
temples, 1
throbbed, 1
more, 1
violently, 1
than, 1
usual., 1
However,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
became, 1
dark,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
could, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
see,, 1
I, 1
fell, 1
asleep;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
aroused, 1
by, 1
a, 1
piercing, 1
shriek,, 1
as, 1
from, 1
a, 1
person, 1
suffering, 1
in, 1
his, 1
dreams,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
suddenly, 1
threw, 1
his, 1
head, 1
back, 1
violently., 1
I, 1
called, 1
the, 1
valet,, 1
I, 1
stopped, 1
the, 1
postilion,, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
I, 1
applied, 1
my, 1
smelling-salts;, 1
but, 1
all, 1
was, 1
over,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
Aix, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
a, 1
corpse.", 1
Villefort, 1
stood, 1
with, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
half, 1
open,, 1
quite, 1
stupefied., 1
"Of, 1
course, 1
you, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
a, 1
doctor?", 1
"Immediately;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
too, 1
late.", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
then, 1
he, 1
could, 1
tell, 1
of, 1
what, 1
complaint, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
marquis, 1
had, 1
died.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
told, 1
me;, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
an, 1
apoplectic, 1
stroke.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
then?", 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
had, 1
always, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
desire,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
his, 1
death, 1
happened, 1
during, 1
his, 1
absence, 1
from, 1
Paris,, 1
that, 1
his, 1
body, 1
might, 1
be, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
the, 1
family, 1
vault., 1
I, 1
had, 1
him, 1
put, 1
into, 1
a, 1
leaden, 1
coffin,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
preceding, 1
him, 1
by, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days.", 1
"Oh,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
mother,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"to, 1
have, 1
such, 1
duties, 1
to, 1
perform, 1
at, 1
your, 1
age, 1
after, 1
such, 1
a, 1
blow!", 1
"God, 1
has, 1
supported, 1
me, 1
through, 1
all;, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
marquis,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
certainly, 1
have, 1
done, 1
everything, 1
for, 1
me, 1
that, 1
I, 1
performed, 1
for, 1
him., 1
It, 1
is, 1
true, 1
that, 1
since, 1
I, 1
left, 1
him,, 1
I, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
my, 1
senses., 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
cry;, 1
at, 1
my, 1
age, 1
they, 1
say, 1
that, 1
we, 1
have, 1
no, 1
more, 1
tears,--still, 1
I, 1
think, 1
that, 1
when, 1
one, 1
is, 1
in, 1
trouble, 1
one, 1
should, 1
have, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
weeping., 1
Where, 1
is, 1
Valentine,, 1
sir?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
on, 1
her, 1
account, 1
I, 1
am, 1
here;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Valentine.", 1
Villefort, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
terrible, 1
to, 1
reply, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
at, 1
a, 1
ball;, 1
so, 1
he, 1
only, 1
said, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
out, 1
with, 1
her, 1
step-mother,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
be, 1
fetched., 1
"This, 1
instant,, 1
sir--this, 1
instant,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
lady., 1
Villefort, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
within, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
conducted, 1
her, 1
to, 1
his, 1
apartment., 1
"Rest, 1
yourself,, 1
mother,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
The, 1
marchioness, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head, 1
at, 1
this, 1
word,, 1
and, 1
beholding, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
so, 1
forcibly, 1
reminded, 1
her, 1
of, 1
her, 1
deeply-regretted, 1
child,, 1
who, 1
still, 1
lived, 1
for, 1
her, 1
in, 1
Valentine,, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
touched, 1
at, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
mother,, 1
and, 1
bursting, 1
into, 1
tears,, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees, 1
before, 1
an, 1
arm-chair,, 1
where, 1
she, 1
buried, 1
her, 1
venerable, 1
head., 1
Villefort, 1
left, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
care, 1
of, 1
the, 1
women,, 1
while, 1
old, 1
Barrois, 1
ran,, 1
half-scared,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
master;, 1
for, 1
nothing, 1
frightens, 1
old, 1
people, 1
so, 1
much, 1
as, 1
when, 1
death, 1
relaxes, 1
its, 1
vigilance, 1
over, 1
them, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
strike, 1
some, 1
other, 1
old, 1
person., 1
Then,, 1
while, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
praying, 1
fervently,, 1
Villefort, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
a, 1
cab,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
daughter, 1
from, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's., 1
He, 1
was, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
when, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ball-room,, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
saying--, 1
"Oh,, 1
father,, 1
some, 1
misfortune, 1
has, 1
happened!", 1
"Your, 1
grandmamma, 1
has, 1
just, 1
arrived,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"And, 1
grandpapa?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
trembling, 1
with, 1
apprehension., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
only, 1
replied, 1
by, 1
offering, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
his, 1
daughter., 1
It, 1
was, 1
just, 1
in, 1
time,, 1
for, 1
Valentine's, 1
head, 1
swam,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
staggered;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
instantly, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
her, 1
assistance,, 1
and, 1
aided, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
in, 1
dragging, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
saying--"What, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
event!, 1
Who, 1
could, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
it?, 1
Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
indeed, 1
strange!", 1
And, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
family, 1
departed,, 1
leaving, 1
a, 1
cloud, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1
hanging, 1
over, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening., 1
At, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
Valentine, 1
found, 1
Barrois, 1
awaiting, 1
her., 1
"M., 1
Noirtier, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
to-night,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone., 1
"Tell, 1
him, 1
I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
when, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
grandmamma,", 1
she, 1
replied,, 1
feeling,, 1
with, 1
true, 1
delicacy,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
could, 1
be, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
service, 1
just, 1
then, 1
was, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran., 1
Valentine, 1
found, 1
her, 1
grandmother, 1
in, 1
bed;, 1
silent, 1
caresses,, 1
heartwrung, 1
sobs,, 1
broken, 1
sighs,, 1
burning, 1
tears,, 1
were, 1
all, 1
that, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
this, 1
sad, 1
interview,, 1
while, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
arm,, 1
maintained, 1
all, 1
outward, 1
forms, 1
of, 1
respect,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
widow., 1
She, 1
soon, 1
whispered, 1
to, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
better, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
retire,, 1
with, 1
your, 1
permission,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
me, 1
appears, 1
still, 1
to, 1
afflict, 1
your, 1
mother-in-law.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
heard, 1
her., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
softly, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
"let, 1
her, 1
leave;, 1
but, 1
do, 1
you, 1
stay.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
remained, 1
alone, 1
beside, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
overcome, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
unexpected, 1
death,, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
Barrois, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
to, 1
old, 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
had,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
sent, 1
his, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
the, 1
cause;, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return,, 1
his, 1
quick, 1
intelligent, 1
eye, 1
interrogated, 1
the, 1
messenger., 1
"Alas,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Barrois,, 1
"a, 1
great, 1
misfortune, 1
has, 1
happened., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
has, 1
arrived,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
is, 1
dead!", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
and, 1
Noirtier, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
on, 1
strict, 1
terms, 1
of, 1
friendship;, 1
still,, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
one, 1
old, 1
man, 1
always, 1
considerably, 1
affects, 1
another., 1
Noirtier, 1
let, 1
his, 1
head, 1
fall, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
chest,, 1
apparently, 1
overwhelmed, 1
and, 1
thoughtful;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
one, 1
eye,, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
inquiry., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine?", 1
Noirtier, 1
nodded, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"She, 1
is, 1
at, 1
the, 1
ball,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
since, 1
she, 1
came, 1
to, 1
say, 1
good-by, 1
to, 1
you, 1
in, 1
full, 1
dress.", 1
Noirtier, 1
again, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
left, 1
eye., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
her?", 1
Noirtier, 1
again, 1
made, 1
an, 1
affirmative, 1
sign., 1
"Well,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
her,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
from, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
await, 1
her, 1
return,, 1
and, 1
beg, 1
her, 1
to, 1
come, 1
up, 1
here., 1
Is, 1
that, 1
what, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
invalid., 1
Barrois,, 1
therefore,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
seen,, 1
watched, 1
for, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
informed, 1
her, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather's, 1
wish., 1
Consequently,, 1
Valentine, 1
came, 1
up, 1
to, 1
Noirtier,, 1
on, 1
leaving, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
who, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grief, 1
had, 1
at, 1
last, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
fatigue, 1
and, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
a, 1
feverish, 1
sleep., 1
Within, 1
reach, 1
of, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
they, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
small, 1
table, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
stood, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
orangeade,, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
beverage,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
glass., 1
Then,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
left, 1
the, 1
bedside, 1
to, 1
see, 1
M., 1
Noirtier., 1
Valentine, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
such, 1
tenderness, 1
that, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
again, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
tears,, 1
whose, 1
sources, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
must, 1
be, 1
exhausted., 1
The, 1
old, 1
gentleman, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
dwell, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
expression., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"you, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
yet, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
grandfather, 1
left,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not.", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
intimated, 1
that, 1
such, 1
was, 1
his, 1
meaning., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
happily, 1
I, 1
have,", 1
replied, 1
Valentine., 1
"Without, 1
that,, 1
what, 1
would, 1
become, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
It, 1
was, 1
one, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
Barrois,, 1
who, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
himself,, 1
observed, 1
that, 1
after, 1
such, 1
sad, 1
events, 1
every, 1
one, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
need, 1
of, 1
rest., 1
Noirtier, 1
would, 1
not, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
only, 1
rest, 1
he, 1
needed, 1
was, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
child,, 1
but, 1
wished, 1
her, 1
good-night,, 1
for, 1
grief, 1
and, 1
fatigue, 1
had, 1
made, 1
her, 1
appear, 1
quite, 1
ill., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
she, 1
found, 1
her, 1
grandmother, 1
in, 1
bed;, 1
the, 1
fever, 1
had, 1
not, 1
abated,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
glistened, 1
and, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
suffering, 1
from, 1
violent, 1
nervous, 1
irritability., 1
"Oh,, 1
dear, 1
grandmamma,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
worse?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Valentine,, 1
perceiving, 1
all, 1
these, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
agitation., 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
child,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
impatiently, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
your, 1
arrival,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
send, 1
for, 1
your, 1
father.", 1
"My, 1
father?", 1
inquired, 1
Valentine,, 1
uneasily., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
Valentine, 1
durst, 1
not, 1
oppose, 1
her, 1
grandmother's, 1
wish,, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
which, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
afterwards, 1
Villefort, 1
entered., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
without, 1
using, 1
any, 1
circumlocution,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
if, 1
fearing, 1
she, 1
had, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose,, 1
"you, 1
wrote, 1
to, 1
me, 1
concerning, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
this, 1
child?", 1
"Yes,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
only, 1
projected, 1
but, 1
arranged.", 1
"Your, 1
intended, 1
son-in-law, 1
is, 1
named, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay?", 1
"Yes,, 1
madame.", 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
not, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
General, 1
d'Epinay, 1
who, 1
was, 1
on, 1
our, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
was, 1
assassinated, 1
some, 1
days, 1
before, 1
the, 1
usurper, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Island, 1
of, 1
Elba?", 1
"The, 1
same.", 1
"Does, 1
he, 1
not, 1
dislike, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
the, 1
granddaughter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Jacobin?", 1
"Our, 1
civil, 1
dissensions, 1
are, 1
now, 1
happily, 1
extinguished,, 1
mother,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
child, 1
when, 1
his, 1
father, 1
died,, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
very, 1
little, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
meet, 1
him,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
with, 1
pleasure,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
with, 1
indifference.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
a, 1
suitable, 1
match?", 1
"In, 1
every, 1
respect.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man?", 1
"Is, 1
regarded, 1
with, 1
universal, 1
esteem.", 1
"You, 1
approve, 1
of, 1
him?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
well-bred, 1
young, 1
men, 1
I, 1
know.", 1
During, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
this, 1
conversation, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
silent., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes', 1
reflection,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
hasten, 1
the, 1
marriage,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
to, 1
live.", 1
"You,, 1
madame?", 1
"You,, 1
dear, 1
mamma?", 1
exclaimed, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time., 1
"I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
saying,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
marchioness;, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
hurry, 1
you,, 1
so, 1
that,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
has, 1
no, 1
mother,, 1
she, 1
may, 1
at, 1
least, 1
have, 1
a, 1
grandmother, 1
to, 1
bless, 1
her, 1
marriage., 1
I, 1
am, 1
all, 1
that, 1
is, 1
left, 1
to, 1
her, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
Renee,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
have, 1
so, 1
soon, 1
forgotten,, 1
sir.", 1
"Ah,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"you, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
give, 1
a, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
my, 1
child.", 1
"A, 1
stepmother, 1
is, 1
never, 1
a, 1
mother,, 1
sir., 1
But, 1
this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
the, 1
purpose,--our, 1
business, 1
concerns, 1
Valentine,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
in, 1
peace.", 1
All, 1
this, 1
was, 1
said, 1
with, 1
such, 1
exceeding, 1
rapidity,, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
in, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
that, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
delirium., 1
"It, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
as, 1
you, 1
wish,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"more, 1
especially, 1
since, 1
your, 1
wishes, 1
coincide, 1
with, 1
mine,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
arrives, 1
in, 1
Paris"--, 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
grandmother,", 1
interrupted, 1
Valentine,, 1
"consider, 1
decorum--the, 1
recent, 1
death., 1
You, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
me, 1
marry, 1
under, 1
such, 1
sad, 1
auspices?", 1
"My, 1
child,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
lady, 1
sharply,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
hear, 1
none, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conventional, 1
objections, 1
that, 1
deter, 1
weak, 1
minds, 1
from, 1
preparing, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future., 1
I, 1
also, 1
was, 1
married, 1
at, 1
the, 1
death-bed, 1
of, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
less, 1
happy, 1
on, 1
that, 1
account.", 1
"Still, 1
that, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Still?--Always!, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
die--do, 1
you, 1
understand?, 1
Well,, 1
before, 1
dying,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
my, 1
son-in-law., 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
to, 1
make, 1
my, 1
child, 1
happy;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
read, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
intends, 1
to, 1
obey, 1
me;--in, 1
fact,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
know, 1
him--I, 1
will!", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
old, 1
lady,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
expression,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
rise, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
my, 1
grave, 1

find, 1
him,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
should, 1
not, 1
fulfil, 1
his, 1
duty!", 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"you, 1
must, 1
lay, 1
aside, 1
these, 1
exalted, 1
ideas,, 1
which, 1
almost, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
madness., 1
The, 1
dead,, 1
once, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
their, 1
graves,, 1

no, 1
more.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
mistaken., 1
This, 1
night, 1
I, 1
have, 1
had, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
sleep., 1
It, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
my, 1
soul, 1
were, 1
already, 1
hovering, 1
over, 1
my, 1
body,, 1
my, 1
eyes,, 1

I, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
open,, 1
closed, 1
against, 1
my, 1
will,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
will, 1
appear, 1
impossible, 1
above, 1
all, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
saw,, 1
with, 1
my, 1
eyes, 1
shut,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
you, 1
are, 1
now, 1
standing,, 1
issuing, 1
from, 1
that, 1
corner, 1
where, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
door, 1
leading, 1
into, 1
Madame, 1
Villefort's, 1
dressing-room--I, 1
saw,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
silently, 1
enter,, 1
a, 1
white, 1
figure.", 1
Valentine, 1
screamed., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
fever, 1
that, 1
disturbed, 1
you,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Doubt,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
say., 1
I, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
white, 1

my, 1
discrediting, 1
the, 1
testimony, 1
of, 1
only, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
senses,, 1

heard, 1
my, 1
glass, 1
removed--the, 1

which, 1
is, 1
there, 1
now, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table.", 1
"Oh,, 1
dear, 1
mother,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
dream.", 1
"So, 1
little, 1
was, 1
it, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
stretched, 1
my, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
bell;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
I, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
disappeared;, 1
my, 1
maid, 1
then, 1
entered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
light.", 1
"But, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
no, 1
one?", 1
"Phantoms, 1
are, 1
visible, 1
to, 1
those, 1
only, 1
who, 1
ought, 1
to, 1

soul, 1

tie, 1
is, 1
even, 1
more, 1
direct,, 1

seems, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"Oh,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
deeply, 1
affected,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
himself,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
those, 1
gloomy, 1
thoughts;, 1

will, 1
long, 1
live, 1
with, 1
us,, 1
happy,, 1
loved,, 1

honored,, 1

we, 1
will, 1
make, 1
you, 1

"Never,, 1
never,, 1
never,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
marchioness., 1
"When, 1
does, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
return?", 1

expect, 1
him, 1
every, 1
moment.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well., 1

soon, 1
as, 1
he, 1
arrives, 1
inform, 1
me., 1

must, 1
be, 1
expeditious., 1
And, 1
then, 1
I, 1
also, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
a, 1
notary,, 1

assured, 1
that, 1
all, 1
our, 1
property, 1
returns, 1
to, 1

"Ah,, 1
grandmamma,", 1
murmured, 1
Valentine,, 1
pressing, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
on, 1
the, 1
burning, 1
brow,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
me?, 1
Oh,, 1
how, 1
feverish, 1
you, 1
are;, 1

doctor?", 1

she,, 1
shrugging, 1
her, 1
shoulders,, 1

am, 1
not, 1
ill;, 1

dear,, 1
my, 1
glass, 1
is, 1
there, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table--give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me,, 1

Valentine, 1
poured, 1
the, 1
orangeade, 1
into, 1
a, 1
glass, 1

gave, 1
it, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandmother, 1
with, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
dread,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
glass, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
touched, 1
by, 1
the, 1
spectre., 1
The, 1
marchioness, 1
drained, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
at, 1
a, 1
single, 1
draught,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
on, 1
her, 1
pillow,, 1
repeating,--"The, 1
notary,, 1
the, 1
notary!", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
seated, 1
herself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bedside, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandmother., 1
The, 1
poor, 1
child, 1
appeared, 1
herself, 1
to, 1
require, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
she, 1
had, 1
recommended, 1
to, 1
her, 1
aged, 1
relative., 1
A, 1
bright, 1
spot, 1
burned, 1
in, 1
either, 1
cheek,, 1
her, 1
respiration, 1
was, 1
short, 1
and, 1
difficult,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
pulse, 1
beat, 1
with, 1
feverish, 1
excitement., 1
She, 1
was, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
despair, 1
of, 1
Maximilian,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
being, 1
an, 1
ally,, 1
was, 1
unconsciously, 1
acting, 1
as, 1
his, 1
enemy., 1
More, 1
than, 1
once, 1
she, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
revealing, 1
all, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandmother,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
hesitated, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
if, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
been, 1
named, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
or, 1
Raoul, 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
but, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
of, 1
plebeian, 1
extraction,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
knew, 1
how, 1
the, 1
haughty, 1
Marquise, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
despised, 1
all, 1
who, 1
were, 1
not, 1
noble., 1
Her, 1
secret, 1
had, 1
each, 1
time, 1
been, 1
repressed, 1
when, 1
she, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
reveal, 1
it,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sad, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
useless, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so;, 1
for,, 1
were, 1
it, 1
once, 1
discovered, 1
by, 1
her, 1
father, 1
and, 1
mother,, 1
all, 1
would, 1
be, 1
lost., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
passed, 1
thus;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
feverish, 1
sleep,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
had, 1
arrived., 1
Though, 1
his, 1
coming, 1
was, 1
announced, 1
in, 1
a, 1
very, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
her, 1
pillow., 1
"The, 1
notary!", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"let, 1
him, 1
come, 1
in.", 1
The, 1
notary,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
immediately, 1
entered., 1
"Go,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
"and, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
with, 1
this, 1
gentleman.", 1
"But,, 1
grandmamma"--, 1
"Leave, 1
me--go!", 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
kissed, 1
her, 1
grandmother,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
with, 1
her, 1
handkerchief, 1
to, 1
her, 1
eyes;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
she, 1
found, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
who, 1
told, 1
her, 1
that, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dining-room., 1
Valentine, 1
instantly, 1
ran, 1
down., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
was, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cleverest, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
very, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
whose, 1
birth, 1
he, 1
had, 1
witnessed., 1
He, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
a, 1
daughter, 1
about, 1
her, 1
age,, 1
but, 1
whose, 1
life, 1
was, 1
one, 1
continued, 1
source, 1
of, 1
anxiety, 1
and, 1
fear, 1
to, 1
him, 1
from, 1
her, 1
mother, 1
having, 1
been, 1
consumptive., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
you, 1
with, 1
such, 1
impatience,, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny., 1
But,, 1
first, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
how, 1
are, 1
Madeleine, 1
and, 1
Antoinette?", 1
Madeleine, 1
was, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
and, 1
Antoinette, 1
his, 1
niece., 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
smiled, 1
sadly., 1
"Antoinette, 1
is, 1
very, 1
well,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"and, 1
Madeleine, 1
tolerably, 1
so., 1
But, 1
you, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
child., 1
It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
your, 1
father, 1
or, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
who, 1
is, 1
ill., 1
As, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
although, 1
we, 1
doctors, 1
cannot, 1
divest, 1
our, 1
patients, 1
of, 1
nerves,, 1
I, 1
fancy, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
further, 1
need, 1
of, 1
me, 1
than, 1
to, 1
recommend, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
your, 1
imagination, 1
to, 1
take, 1
too, 1
wide, 1
a, 1
field.", 1
Valentine, 1
colored., 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
science, 1
of, 1
divination, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
a, 1
miraculous, 1
extent,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
physicians, 1
who, 1
always, 1
work, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
body, 1
through, 1
the, 1
mind., 1
"No,", 1
she, 1
replied,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
grandmother., 1
You, 1
know, 1
the, 1
calamity, 1
that, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
nothing.", 1
said, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
restraining, 1
her, 1
tears,, 1
"my, 1
grandfather, 1
is, 1
dead.", 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Suddenly?", 1
"From, 1
an, 1
apoplectic, 1
stroke.", 1
"An, 1
apoplectic, 1
stroke?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
grandmother, 1
fancies, 1
that, 1
her, 1
husband,, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
never, 1
left,, 1
has, 1
called, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
must, 1
go, 1
and, 1
join, 1
him., 1
Oh,, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
do, 1
something, 1
for, 1
her!", 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
she?", 1
"In, 1
her, 1
room, 1
with, 1
the, 1
notary.", 1
"And, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"Just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
perfectly, 1
clear,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
same, 1
incapability, 1
of, 1
moving, 1
or, 1
speaking.", 1
"And, 1
the, 1
same, 1
love, 1
for, 1
you--eh,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
child?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
very, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
me.", 1
"Who, 1
does, 1
not, 1
love, 1
you?", 1
Valentine, 1
smiled, 1
sadly., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
your, 1
grandmother's, 1
symptoms?", 1
"An, 1
extreme, 1
nervous, 1
excitement, 1
and, 1
a, 1
strangely, 1
agitated, 1
sleep;, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
in, 1
her, 1
sleep, 1
that, 1
her, 1
soul, 1
was, 1
hovering, 1
above, 1
her, 1
body,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
watched., 1
It, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
delirium;, 1
she, 1
fancies,, 1
too,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
phantom, 1
enter, 1
her, 1
chamber, 1
and, 1
even, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
it, 1
made, 1
on, 1
touching, 1
her, 1
glass.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
singular,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
was, 1
subject, 1
to, 1
such, 1
hallucinations.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
in, 1
this, 1
condition,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"and, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
she, 1
frightened, 1
me, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
her, 1
mad;, 1
and, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
you, 1
know, 1
is, 1
a, 1
strong-minded, 1
man,, 1
himself, 1
appeared, 1
deeply, 1
impressed.", 1
"We, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"what, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
seems, 1
very, 1
strange.", 1
The, 1
notary, 1
here, 1
descended,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
her, 1
grandmother, 1
was, 1
alone., 1
"Go, 1
upstairs,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"And, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
dare, 1
not--she, 1
forbade, 1
my, 1
sending, 1
for, 1
you;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
myself, 1
agitated,, 1
feverish, 1
and, 1
out, 1
of, 1
sorts., 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
take, 1
a, 1
turn, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
to, 1
recover, 1
myself.", 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
pressed, 1
Valentine's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
he, 1
visited, 1
her, 1
grandmother,, 1
she, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
steps., 1
We, 1
need, 1
not, 1
say, 1
which, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
was, 1
her, 1
favorite, 1
walk., 1
After, 1
remaining, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
in, 1
the, 1
parterre, 1
surrounding, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
gathering, 1
a, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
place, 1
in, 1
her, 1
waist, 1
or, 1
hair,, 1
she, 1
turned, 1
into, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
avenue, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bench;, 1
then, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bench, 1
she, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate., 1
As, 1
usual,, 1
Valentine, 1
strolled, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
among, 1
her, 1
flowers,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
gathering, 1
them., 1
The, 1
mourning, 1
in, 1
her, 1
heart, 1
forbade, 1
her, 1
assuming, 1
this, 1
simple, 1
ornament,, 1
though, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
had, 1
time, 1
to, 1
put, 1
on, 1
the, 1
outward, 1
semblance, 1
of, 1
woe., 1
She, 1
then, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
avenue., 1
As, 1
she, 1
advanced, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
speaking, 1
her, 1
name., 1
She, 1
stopped, 1
astonished,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
reached, 1
her, 1
ear, 1
more, 1
distinctly,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
recognized, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Maximilian., 1
Chapter, 1
73., 1
The, 1
Promise., 1
It, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
wretched, 1
existence, 1
since, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
day., 1
With, 1
the, 1
instinct, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
lovers, 1
he, 1
had, 1
anticipated, 1
after, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
and, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
that, 1
something, 1
would, 1
occur, 1
at, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
in, 1
connection, 1
with, 1
his, 1
attachment, 1
for, 1
Valentine., 1
His, 1
presentiments, 1
were, 1
realized,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
see,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
uneasy, 1
forebodings, 1
had, 1
goaded, 1
him, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
under, 1
the, 1
chestnut-trees., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
this, 1
sorrow, 1
and, 1
anxiety,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
his, 1
accustomed, 1
hour, 1
for, 1
visiting, 1
her,, 1
she, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
simply, 1
by, 1
accident, 1
or, 1
perhaps, 1
through, 1
sympathy., 1
Morrel, 1
called, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate., 1
"You, 1
here, 1
at, 1
this, 1
hour?", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
girl,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
and, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
bad, 1
tidings.", 1
"This, 1
is,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
house, 1
of, 1
mourning,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"speak,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
although, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
of, 1
sorrow, 1
seems, 1
already, 1
full.", 1
"Dear, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
his, 1
own, 1
emotion,, 1
"listen,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
you;, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
say, 1
is, 1
very, 1
serious., 1
When, 1
are, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"from, 1
you, 1
I, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
conceal., 1
This, 1
morning, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
was, 1
introduced,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
grandmother,, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
depended, 1
as, 1
my, 1
only, 1
support,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
declared, 1
herself, 1
favorable, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
is, 1
so, 1
anxious, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
only, 1
await, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
will, 1
be, 1
signed.", 1
A, 1
deep, 1
sigh, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
gazed, 1
long, 1
and, 1
mournfully, 1
at, 1
her, 1
he, 1
loved., 1
"Alas,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
dreadful, 1
thus, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
my, 1
condemnation, 1
from, 1
your, 1
own, 1
lips., 1
The, 1
sentence, 1
is, 1
passed,, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
hours,, 1
will, 1
be, 1
executed;, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
so,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
it., 1
But,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
say, 1
nothing, 1
remains, 1
but, 1
for, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
to, 1
arrive, 1
that, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
may, 1
be, 1
signed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
his,, 1
to-morrow, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
engaged, 1
to, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
came, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
to, 1
Paris.", 1
Valentine, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
since,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"we, 1
were, 1
speaking,, 1
he, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sorrow, 1
your, 1
family, 1
had, 1
experienced,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
of, 1
your, 1
grief,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
into, 1
the, 1
court-yard., 1
Never,, 1
till, 1
then,, 1
had, 1
I, 1
placed, 1
any, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
presentiments,, 1
but, 1
now, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
believing, 1
them,, 1
Valentine., 1
At, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
that, 1
carriage, 1
I, 1
shuddered;, 1
soon, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
steps, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
which, 1
terrified, 1
me, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
the, 1
footsteps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
commander, 1
did, 1
Don, 1
Juan., 1

door, 1
at, 1

opened;, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
entered, 1
first,, 1

I, 1
began, 1
to, 1
hope, 1
my, 1
fears, 1
were, 1
vain,, 1
when,, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
another, 1
young, 1
man, 1
advanced,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
exclaimed--'Ah,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay!', 1
I, 1
summoned, 1
all, 1
my, 1
strength, 1
and, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
my, 1
support., 1
Perhaps, 1
I, 1
turned, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembled,, 1
but, 1
certainly, 1
I, 1
smiled;, 1
and, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
I, 1
left,, 1
without, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
one, 1
word, 1
that, 1
had, 1
passed.", 1
"Poor, 1
Maximilian!", 1
murmured, 1
Valentine., 1
"Valentine,, 1
the, 1
time, 1
has, 1
arrived, 1
when, 1
you, 1
must, 1
answer, 1
me., 1

remember, 1
my, 1
life, 1
depends, 1
on, 1
your, 1
answer., 1
What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
doing?", 1
Valentine, 1
held, 1
down, 1
her, 1
head;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
overwhelmed., 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1

our, 1
present, 1
position,, 1

a, 1
serious, 1
and, 1
urgent, 1
one;, 1

do, 1
not, 1

a, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
give, 1
way, 1
to, 1
useless, 1
sorrow;, 1

to, 1
suffer, 1
at, 1
their, 1
leisure, 1

their, 1
grief, 1

There, 1
are, 1
such, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
God, 1
will, 1
doubtless, 1
reward, 1
them, 1
in, 1
heaven, 1
for, 1
their, 1
resignation, 1
on, 1
earth,, 1
but, 1
those, 1
who, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
contend, 1
must, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
one, 1
precious, 1
moment,, 1

must, 1
return, 1
immediately, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
which, 1
fortune, 1
strikes., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
against, 1
our, 1
ill-fortune?, 1

me,, 1
Valentine, 1

it, 1
is, 1
that, 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
know.", 1
Valentine, 1
trembled,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
with, 1
amazement., 1
The, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
resisting, 1
her, 1
father,, 1
her, 1
grandmother,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
had, 1
never, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
her., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
a, 1
struggle?, 1
Oh,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
sacrilege., 1
What?, 1

resist, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
order,, 1

my, 1
dying, 1
grandmother's, 1

Impossible!", 1
Morrel, 1
started., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
too, 1
noble, 1

to, 1
understand, 1
me,, 1

you, 1
understand, 1
me, 1

well, 1
that, 1

No,, 1
no;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
need, 1
all, 1

strength, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
with, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
support, 1
my, 1
grief, 1
in, 1

you, 1

But, 1
to, 1
grieve, 1
my, 1
father--to, 1
disturb, 1
my, 1
grandmother's, 1
last, 1
moments--never!", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
calmly., 1
"In, 1
what, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
you, 1
speak!", 1
cried, 1
Valentine., 1
"I, 1
speak, 1
as, 1
one, 1
who, 1
admires, 1

"Mademoiselle,", 1
cried, 1
Valentine;, 1
"mademoiselle!, 1

selfish, 1
man,--he, 1
sees, 1
me, 1
in, 1
despair,, 1

Morrel,, 1
whose, 1
low, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
clinched, 1
hands, 1
announced, 1
his, 1
growing, 1
desperation., 1

aside, 1

loose, 1
plank,, 1

Valentine,, 1
raising, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
and, 1
sighing., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
free,", 1
replied, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"and, 1
rich, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
support, 1
you., 1

young, 1
girl., 1

Morrel;, 1
"I, 1

Valentine, 1
shook, 1
her, 1
head., 1
"I, 1
feared, 1
it,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
counsel, 1
of, 1
a, 1
madman,, 1

I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
more, 1
mad, 1

Morrel, 1
sorrowfully., 1
"Yes,--if, 1
I, 1
die!", 1
"Well,, 1
Valentine,", 1
resumed, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
only, 1
say, 1
again, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right., 1
Truly,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
I, 1
who, 1
am, 1
mad,, 1

you, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
me, 1
that, 1
passion, 1
blinds, 1
the, 1
most, 1
well-meaning., 1
I, 1
appreciate, 1
your, 1
calm, 1

is, 1

Franz, 1
d'Epinay,, 1

effect, 1
of, 1
a, 1
comedy, 1
called, 1

you, 1

me, 1

Valentine,, 1
"again, 1
you, 1

the, 1
dagger, 1

Morrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
smile,, 1

selfish--you, 1

a, 1
selfish, 1
man, 1

have, 1
known, 1

the, 1

hopes, 1
of, 1

no, 1
more;, 1

say, 1
only, 1
that, 1

against, 1

had, 1
thought, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
heaven,, 1

now, 1

lost, 1

he, 1
has, 1

Morrel, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
calmness;, 1
Valentine, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
with, 1
her, 1
large,, 1
scrutinizing, 1
eyes,, 1

discover, 1
the, 1
grief, 1

struggled, 1
in, 1
her, 1
heart., 1

in, 1
a, 1
word,, 1

doing, 1
so,--I, 1
repeat, 1
it,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
losing, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
lose, 1
my, 1
life., 1
"The, 1
moment, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
My, 1
sister, 1
is, 1
happily, 1
married;, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
is, 1
only, 1
my, 1
brother-in-law,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
ties, 1
of, 1
social, 1
life, 1
alone, 1
attach, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
no, 1
one, 1
then, 1
longer, 1
needs, 1
my, 1
useless, 1
life., 1
This, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
do;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
wait, 1
until, 1
the, 1
very, 1
moment, 1
you, 1
are, 1
married,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
unexpected, 1
chances, 1
which, 1
are, 1
sometimes, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
us,, 1
since, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
may,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
die, 1
before, 1
that, 1
time,, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt, 1
may, 1
fall, 1
even, 1
on, 1
the, 1
altar, 1
as, 1
you, 1
approach, 1
it,--nothing, 1
appears, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
one, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
and, 1
miracles, 1
appear, 1
quite, 1
reasonable, 1
when, 1
his, 1
escape, 1
from, 1
death, 1
is, 1
concerned., 1
I, 1
will,, 1
then,, 1
wait, 1
until, 1
the, 1
last, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
my, 1
misery, 1
is, 1
certain,, 1
irremediable,, 1
hopeless,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
write, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
my, 1
brother-in-law,, 1
another, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prefect, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
to, 1
acquaint, 1
them, 1
with, 1

at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
some, 1
wood,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brink, 1
of, 1
some, 1
abyss,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bank, 1
of, 1
some, 1
river,, 1

will, 1
put, 1
an, 1
end, 1
to, 1
my, 1
existence,, 1

certainly, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1

son, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
honest, 1
man, 1
who, 1
ever, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
France.", 1
Valentine, 1
trembled, 1
convulsively;, 1
she, 1
loosened, 1
her, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
fell, 1
by, 1
her, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
large, 1
tears, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
her, 1
cheeks., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
her,, 1
sorrowful, 1
and, 1
resolute., 1
"Oh,, 1
for, 1
pity's, 1
sake,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
live,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"No,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
will, 1
not, 1
affect, 1
you., 1
You, 1
have, 1
done, 1
your, 1
duty,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
conscience, 1
will, 1
be, 1
at, 1
rest.", 1
Valentine, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
almost, 1
bursting, 1
heart., 1
"Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"Maximilian,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
my, 1
brother, 1
on, 1
earth,, 1
my, 1
true, 1
husband, 1

may, 1
one, 1
day, 1

united.", 1
"Adieu,, 1
Valentine,", 1
repeated, 1
Morrel., 1
"My, 1
God,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
raising, 1
both, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sublime, 1
expression,, 1

done, 1
my, 1
utmost, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
a, 1
submissive, 1

cried, 1
she,, 1
willing, 1
away, 1
her, 1
tears,, 1
and, 1
resuming, 1
her, 1
firmness,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1

Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
already, 1
gone, 1
some, 1
few, 1
steps, 1
away,, 1
again, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
extended, 1
both, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
Valentine, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening., 1
"Valentine,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"dear, 1
Valentine,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
thus--rather, 1

me, 1
die., 1

should, 1
I, 1
obtain, 1
you, 1
by, 1
violence,, 1
if, 1
our, 1
love, 1
is, 1
mutual?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
from, 1
mere, 1
humanity, 1
you, 1
bid, 1
me, 1
live?, 1
I, 1
would, 1
then, 1
rather, 1

"Truly,", 1
murmured, 1
Valentine,, 1
"who, 1

this, 1
earth, 1
cares, 1
for, 1
me,, 1

up, 1

ungrateful, 1
girl, 1

up, 1

Maximilian,, 1

not, 1

M., 1
Noirtier, 1
has, 1
evinced,, 1

a, 1
kind, 1
feeling, 1
towards, 1

very, 1
soon, 1

happiness, 1
that, 1
awaits, 1
us.", 1

see,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
see, 1
the, 1
power, 1
you, 1
have, 1
over, 1
me,, 1
you, 1
almost, 1
make, 1
me, 1
believe, 1
you;, 1
and, 1
yet,, 1
what, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
is, 1
madness,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
father, 1
will, 1
curse, 1
me--he, 1
is, 1
inflexible--he, 1
will, 1
never, 1
pardon, 1
me., 1

listen, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
Maximilian;, 1

by, 1
artifice,, 1
by, 1
entreaty,, 1
by, 1
accident--in, 1
short,, 1

by, 1
any, 1
means, 1

can, 1
delay, 1

you,, 1
as, 1
faithfully, 1
as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
me, 1

this, 1
horrible, 1
marriage, 1

magistrate, 1

a, 1
priest,, 1

will, 1
refuse.", 1
"I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
by, 1
all, 1
that, 1
is, 1
most, 1
sacred, 1
to, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1

by, 1
my, 1
mother.", 1
"We, 1
will, 1
wait,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Yes,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
wait,", 1
replied, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
revived, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words;, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
so, 1
many, 1
things, 1
which, 1
may, 1
save, 1

beings, 1

"I, 1
rely, 1
on, 1

Morrel;, 1

d'Epinay, 1
should, 1

called, 1

to, 1
sign, 1

"Then, 1
you, 1
have, 1
my, 1

Maximilian.", 1
"Instead, 1
of, 1
signing"--, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

will, 1
fly;, 1

is, 1
a, 1
miracle,, 1

is, 1
a, 1
providence, 1

been, 1
discovered., 1

were, 1
surprised,, 1

were, 1
known, 1

resource.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
Valentine;, 1

how, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
ascertain?", 1
"From, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
M., 1
Deschamps.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
him.", 1
"And, 1
for, 1
myself--I, 1
will, 1
write, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
depend, 1
on, 1
me., 1

dread, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
you.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
adored, 1
Valentine,, 1
thank, 1
you;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
enough., 1
When, 1
once, 1
I, 1
know, 1
the, 1
hour,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1

can, 1
easily, 1
get, 1
over, 1
this, 1
fence, 1
with, 1
my, 1
assistance,, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
will, 1
await, 1
us, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
in, 1

will, 1
accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
my, 1
sister's;, 1

living,, 1
retired, 1

mingling, 1
in, 1
society,, 1

shall, 1
be, 1
enabled, 1
to, 1
use, 1
our, 1
power, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
oppression,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
suffer, 1
ourselves, 1
to, 1
be, 1
put, 1
to, 1
death, 1
like, 1
sheep,, 1
which, 1
only, 1
defend, 1
themselves, 1
by, 1
sighs.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
now, 1
acknowledge, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
and, 1
now, 1
are, 1
you, 1
satisfied, 1
with, 1
your, 1
betrothal?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
sorrowfully., 1
"My, 1
adored, 1
Valentine,, 1
words, 1
cannot, 1
express, 1
one, 1
half, 1
of, 1
my, 1
satisfaction.", 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
approached,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
so, 1
near, 1
the, 1
fence,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
nearly, 1
touched, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Morrel,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
pressed, 1
against, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
inexorable, 1
barrier., 1
"Adieu,, 1
then,, 1
till, 1
we, 1
meet, 1
again,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
tearing, 1
herself, 1
away., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
hear, 1
from, 1
you?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Thanks,, 1
thanks,, 1
dear, 1
love,, 1
adieu!", 1
The, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
kiss, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
fled, 1
through, 1
the, 1
avenue., 1
Morrel, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
the, 1
last, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
her, 1
dress, 1
brushing, 1
the, 1
branches,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
her, 1
footstep, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gravel,, 1
then, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
an, 1
ineffable, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
thankfulness, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
for, 1
being, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
be, 1
thus, 1
loved,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
also, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
returned, 1
home, 1
and, 1
waited, 1
all, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day, 1
without, 1
getting, 1
any, 1
message., 1
It, 1
was, 1
only, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day,, 1
at, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
starting, 1
to, 1
call, 1
on, 1
M., 1
Deschamps,, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
received, 1
from, 1
the, 1
postman, 1
a, 1
small, 1
billet,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
to, 1
be, 1
from, 1
Valentine,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
before, 1
seen, 1
her, 1
writing., 1
It, 1
was, 1
to, 1
this, 1
effect:--, 1
Tears,, 1
entreaties,, 1
prayers,, 1
have, 1
availed, 1
me, 1
nothing., 1
Yesterday,, 1
for, 1
two, 1
hours,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
church, 1
of, 1
Saint-Phillippe, 1
du, 1
Roule,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
I, 1
prayed, 1
most, 1
fervently., 1
Heaven, 1
is, 1
as, 1
inflexible, 1
as, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
signature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
is, 1
fixed, 1
for, 1
this, 1
evening, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock., 1
I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
promise, 1
and, 1
but, 1
one, 1
heart, 1
to, 1
give;, 1
that, 1
promise, 1
is, 1
pledged, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
heart, 1
is, 1
also, 1
yours., 1
This, 1
evening,, 1
then,, 1
at, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
to, 1
nine, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate., 1
Your, 1
betrothed,, 1
Valentine, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
P.S.--My, 1
poor, 1
grandmother, 1
gets, 1
worse, 1
and, 1
worse;, 1
yesterday, 1
her, 1
fever, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
delirium;, 1
to-day, 1
her, 1
delirium, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
madness., 1
You, 1
will, 1
be, 1
very, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
Morrel,, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
forget, 1
my, 1
sorrow, 1
in, 1
leaving, 1
her, 1
thus?, 1
I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
is, 1
kept, 1
a, 1
secret, 1
from, 1
grandpapa, 1
Noirtier,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
signed, 1
this, 1
evening., 1
Morrel, 1
went, 1
also, 1
to, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
who, 1
confirmed, 1
the, 1
news, 1
that, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
signed, 1
that, 1
evening., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
call, 1
on, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
heard, 1
still, 1
more., 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
been, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
the, 1
ceremony,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
also, 1
written, 1
to, 1
beg, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1
her, 1
not, 1
inviting, 1
him;, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
and, 1
the, 1
dangerous, 1
illness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
widow, 1
would, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
gloom, 1
over, 1
the, 1
meeting, 1
which, 1
she, 1
would, 1
regret, 1
should, 1
be, 1
shared, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
wished, 1
every, 1
happiness., 1
The, 1
day, 1
before, 1
Franz, 1
had, 1
been, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
left, 1
her, 1
bed, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
had, 1
been, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
it, 1
immediately, 1
after., 1
It, 1
is, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
Morrel's, 1
agitation, 1
would, 1
not, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
penetrating, 1
eye., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
more, 1
affectionate, 1
than, 1
ever,--indeed,, 1
his, 1
manner, 1
was, 1
so, 1
kind, 1
that, 1
several, 1
times, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
telling, 1
him, 1
all., 1
But, 1
he, 1
recalled, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
secret., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
read, 1
Valentine's, 1
letter, 1
twenty, 1
times, 1
in, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day., 1
It, 1
was, 1
her, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
what, 1
an, 1
occasion!, 1
Each, 1
time, 1
he, 1
read, 1
it, 1
he, 1
renewed, 1
his, 1
vow, 1
to, 1
make, 1
her, 1
happy., 1
How, 1
great, 1
is, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
has, 1
made, 1
so, 1
courageous, 1
a, 1
resolution!, 1
What, 1
devotion, 1
does, 1
she, 1
deserve, 1
from, 1
him, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
has, 1
sacrificed, 1
everything!, 1
How, 1
ought, 1
she, 1
really, 1
to, 1
be, 1
supremely, 1
loved!, 1
She, 1
becomes, 1
at, 1
once, 1
a, 1
queen, 1
and, 1
a, 1
wife,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
thank, 1
and, 1
love, 1
her, 1
sufficiently., 1
Morrel, 1
longed, 1
intensely, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
he, 1
should, 1
hear, 1
Valentine, 1
say,, 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
come, 1
and, 1
help, 1
me.", 1
He, 1
had, 1
arranged, 1
everything, 1
for, 1
her, 1
escape;, 1
two, 1
ladders, 1
were, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
the, 1
clover-field;, 1
a, 1
cabriolet, 1
was, 1
ordered, 1
for, 1
Maximilian, 1
alone,, 1
without, 1
a, 1
servant,, 1
without, 1
lights;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
turning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
street, 1
they, 1
would, 1
light, 1
the, 1
lamps,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
foolish, 1
to, 1
attract, 1
the, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
police, 1
by, 1
too, 1
many, 1
precautions., 1
Occasionally, 1
he, 1
shuddered;, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
that, 1
wall,, 1
he, 1
should, 1
protect, 1
the, 1
descent, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dear, 1
Valentine,, 1
pressing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
her, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
yet, 1
only, 1
kissed, 1
the, 1
delicate, 1
hand., 1
When, 1
the, 1
afternoon, 1
arrived, 1
and, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
was, 1
drawing, 1
near,, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
for, 1
solitude,, 1
his, 1
agitation, 1
was, 1
extreme;, 1
a, 1
simple, 1
question, 1
from, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
would, 1
have, 1
irritated, 1
him., 1
He, 1
shut, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
read,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
glanced, 1
over, 1
the, 1
page, 1
without, 1
understanding, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
away, 1
the, 1
book,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
to, 1
sketch, 1
his, 1
plan,, 1
the, 1
ladders, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fence., 1
At, 1
length, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
drew, 1
near., 1
Never, 1
did, 1
a, 1
man, 1
deeply, 1
in, 1
love, 1
allow, 1
the, 1
clocks, 1
to, 1
go, 1
on, 1
peacefully., 1
Morrel, 1
tormented, 1
his, 1
so, 1
effectually, 1
that, 1
they, 1
struck, 1
eight, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
six., 1
He, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
time, 1
to, 1
start;, 1
the, 1
signature, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
fixed, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock,, 1
but, 1
perhaps, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
that.", 1
Consequently,, 1
Morrel,, 1
having, 1
left, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
eight, 1
by, 1
his, 1
timepiece,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
clover-field, 1
while, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
of, 1
Saint-Phillippe, 1
du, 1
Roule, 1
was, 1
striking, 1
eight., 1
The, 1
horse, 1
and, 1
cabriolet, 1
were, 1
concealed, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
small, 1
ruin,, 1
where, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
often, 1
waited., 1
The, 1
night, 1
gradually, 1
drew, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
foliage, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
assumed, 1
a, 1
deeper, 1
hue., 1
Then, 1
Morrel, 1
came, 1
out, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hiding-place, 1
with, 1
a, 1
beating, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
through, 1
the, 1
small, 1
opening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gate;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
no, 1
one, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen., 1
The, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
half-past, 1
eight,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
another, 1
half-hour, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
waiting,, 1
while, 1
Morrel, 1
walked, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro,, 1
and, 1
gazed, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
frequently, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening., 1
The, 1
garden, 1
became, 1
darker, 1
still,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
for, 1
the, 1
white, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
he, 1
vainly, 1
listened, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
footsteps., 1
The, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
discernible, 1
through, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
darkness,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
no, 1
indication, 1
that, 1
so, 1
important, 1
an, 1
event, 1
as, 1
the, 1
signature, 1
of, 1
a, 1
marriage-contract, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on., 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
which, 1
wanted, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
to, 1
ten;, 1
but, 1
soon, 1
the, 1
same, 1
clock, 1
he, 1
had, 1
already, 1
heard, 1
strike, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times, 1
rectified, 1
the, 1
error, 1
by, 1
striking, 1
half-past, 1
nine., 1
This, 1
was, 1
already, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
past, 1
the, 1
time, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
fixed., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
slightest, 1
rustling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
foliage,, 1
the, 1
least, 1
whistling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wind,, 1
attracted, 1
his, 1
attention,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
to, 1
his, 1
brow;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
tremblingly, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
ladder,, 1
and,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
step., 1
Amidst, 1
all, 1
these, 1
alternations, 1
of, 1
hope, 1
and, 1
fear,, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
ten., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
impossible,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
signing, 1
of, 1
a, 1
contract, 1
should, 1
occupy, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time, 1
without, 1
unexpected, 1
interruptions., 1
I, 1
have, 1
weighed, 1
all, 1
the, 1
chances,, 1
calculated, 1
the, 1
time, 1
required, 1
for, 1
all, 1
the, 1
forms;, 1
something, 1
must, 1
have, 1
happened.", 1
And, 1
then, 1
he, 1
walked, 1
rapidly, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro,, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
burning, 1
forehead, 1
against, 1
the, 1
fence., 1
Had, 1
Valentine, 1
fainted?, 1
or, 1
had, 1
she, 1
been, 1
discovered, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
in, 1
her, 1
flight?, 1
These, 1
were, 1
the, 1
only, 1
obstacles, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
her, 1
strength, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
her, 1
in, 1
attempting, 1
to, 1
escape,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
fainted, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paths,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
one, 1
that, 1
most, 1
impressed, 1
itself, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
lose, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
my, 1
own, 1
fault.", 1
He, 1
dwelt, 1
on, 1
this, 1
idea, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
then, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
reality., 1
He, 1
even, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
could, 1
perceive, 1
something, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
at, 1
a, 1
distance;, 1
he, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
call,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
wafted, 1
back, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
inarticulate, 1
sigh., 1
At, 1
last, 1
the, 1
half-hour, 1
struck., 1
It, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
longer,, 1
his, 1
temples, 1
throbbed, 1
violently,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
growing, 1
dim;, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
one, 1
leg, 1
over, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
leaped, 1
down, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side., 1
He, 1
was, 1
on, 1
Villefort's, 1
premises--had, 1
arrived, 1
there, 1
by, 1
scaling, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
What, 1
might, 1
be, 1
the, 1
consequences?, 1
However,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
ventured, 1
thus, 1
far, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
back., 1
He, 1
followed, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance, 1
close, 1
under, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
then, 1
crossed, 1
a, 1
path,, 1
hid, 1
entered, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
could, 1
see, 1
the, 1
house, 1
distinctly., 1
Then, 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
right, 1
in, 1
believing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
house, 1
was, 1
not, 1
illuminated., 1
Instead, 1
of, 1
lights, 1
at, 1
every, 1
window,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
customary, 1
on, 1
days, 1
of, 1
ceremony,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
only, 1
a, 1
gray, 1
mass,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
veiled, 1
also, 1
by, 1
a, 1
cloud,, 1
which, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
obscured, 1
the, 1
moon's, 1
feeble, 1
light., 1
A, 1
light, 1
moved, 1
rapidly, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
past, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
floor., 1
These, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
were, 1
in, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
room., 1
Another, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
behind, 1
some, 1
red, 1
curtains, 1
which, 1
were, 1
in, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
bedroom., 1
Morrel, 1
guessed, 1
all, 1
this., 1
So, 1
many, 1
times,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
Valentine, 1
in, 1
thought, 1
at, 1
every, 1
hour, 1
in, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
made, 1
her, 1
describe, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
house,, 1
that, 1
without, 1
having, 1
seen, 1
it, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
it, 1
all., 1
This, 1
darkness, 1
and, 1
silence, 1
alarmed, 1
Morrel, 1
still, 1
more, 1
than, 1
Valentine's, 1
absence, 1
had, 1
done., 1
Almost, 1
mad, 1
with, 1
grief,, 1
and, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
venture, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
see, 1
Valentine, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
he, 1
feared,, 1
Morrel, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
edge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
as, 1
quickly, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
through, 1
the, 1
flower-garden,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
voice,, 1
still, 1
at, 1
some, 1
distance,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
was, 1
borne, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
wind,, 1
reached, 1
him., 1
At, 1
this, 1
sound,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
already, 1
partially, 1
exposed, 1
to, 1
view,, 1
he, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
and, 1
concealed, 1
himself, 1
completely,, 1
remaining, 1
perfectly, 1
motionless., 1
He, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
his, 1
resolution., 1
If, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Valentine, 1
alone,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
speak, 1
as, 1
she, 1
passed;, 1
if, 1
she, 1
was, 1
accompanied,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
speak,, 1
still, 1
he, 1
should, 1
see, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
know, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
safe;, 1
if, 1
they, 1
were, 1
strangers,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
listen, 1
to, 1
their, 1
conversation,, 1
and, 1
might, 1
understand, 1
something, 1
of, 1
this, 1
hitherto, 1
incomprehensible, 1
mystery., 1
The, 1
moon, 1
had, 1
just, 1
then, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
cloud, 1
which, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1
Villefort, 1
come, 1
out, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
in, 1
black., 1
They, 1
descended,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
soon, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
other, 1
gentleman, 1
as, 1
Doctor, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
seeing, 1
them, 1
approach,, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
mechanically,, 1
until, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
stopped, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sycamore-tree, 1
in, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clump;, 1
there, 1
he, 1
was, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
remain., 1
Soon, 1
the, 1
two, 1
gentlemen, 1
stopped, 1
also., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
doctor,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
"heaven, 1
declares, 1
itself, 1
against, 1
my, 1
house!, 1
What, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
death--what, 1
a, 1
blow!, 1
Seek, 1
not, 1
to, 1
console, 1
me;, 1
alas,, 1
nothing, 1
can, 1
alleviate, 1
so, 1
great, 1
a, 1
sorrow--the, 1
wound, 1
is, 1
too, 1
deep, 1
and, 1
too, 1
fresh!, 1
Dead,, 1
dead!", 1
The, 1
cold, 1
sweat, 1
sprang, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
chattered., 1
Who, 1
could, 1
be, 1
dead, 1
in, 1
that, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
Villefort, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
called, 1
accursed?, 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
redoubled, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
led, 1
you, 1
here, 1
to, 1
console, 1
you;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary"--, 1
"What, 1
can, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
alarmed., 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
which, 1
has, 1
just, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
another,, 1
perhaps,, 1
still, 1
greater.", 1
"Can, 1
it, 1
be, 1
possible?", 1
murmured, 1
Villefort,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
"Are, 1
we, 1
quite, 1
alone,, 1
my, 1
friend?", 1
"Yes,, 1
quite;, 1
but, 1
why, 1
all, 1
these, 1
precautions?", 1
"Because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
secret, 1
to, 1
communicate, 1
to, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
sit, 1
down.", 1
Villefort, 1
fell,, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
seated, 1
himself., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
stood, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder., 1
Morrel,, 1
horrified,, 1
supported, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
lest, 1
its, 1
beatings, 1
should, 1
be, 1
heard., 1
"Dead,, 1
dead!", 1
repeated, 1
he, 1
within, 1
himself;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
also, 1
dying., 1
"Speak,, 1
doctor--I, 1
am, 1
listening,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"strike--I, 1
am, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
everything!", 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
was,, 1
doubtless,, 1
advancing, 1
in, 1
years,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
enjoyed, 1
excellent, 1
health.", 1
Morrel, 1
began, 1
again, 1
to, 1
breathe, 1
freely,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
done, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
ten, 1
minutes., 1
"Grief, 1
has, 1
consumed, 1
her,", 1
said, 1
Villefort--"yes,, 1
grief,, 1
doctor!, 1
After, 1
living, 1
forty, 1
years, 1
with, 1
the, 1
marquis"--, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
grief,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Villefort,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"grief, 1
may, 1
kill,, 1
although, 1
it, 1
rarely, 1
does,, 1
and, 1
never, 1
in, 1
a, 1
day,, 1
never, 1
in, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
never, 1
in, 1
ten, 1
minutes.", 1
Villefort, 1
answered, 1
nothing,, 1
he, 1
simply, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
cast, 1
down, 1
before,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
with, 1
amazement., 1
"Were, 1
you, 1
present, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
struggle?", 1
asked, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"I, 1
was,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
procureur;, 1
"you, 1
begged, 1
me, 1
not, 1
to, 1
leave.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
symptoms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disease, 1
to, 1
which, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
has, 1
fallen, 1
a, 1
victim?", 1
"I, 1
did., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
had, 1
three, 1
successive, 1
attacks,, 1
at, 1
intervals, 1
of, 1
some, 1
minutes,, 1
each, 1
one, 1
more, 1
serious, 1
than, 1
the, 1
former., 1
When, 1
you, 1
arrived,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
had, 1
already, 1
been, 1
panting, 1
for, 1
breath, 1
some, 1
minutes;, 1
she, 1
then, 1
had, 1
a, 1
fit,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
took, 1
to, 1
be, 1
simply, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
attack,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
raise, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
limbs, 1
and, 1
neck, 1
appear, 1
stiffened,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
became, 1
really, 1
alarmed., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
understood, 1
from, 1
your, 1
countenance, 1
there, 1
was, 1
more, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
than, 1
I, 1
had, 1
thought., 1
This, 1
crisis, 1
past,, 1
I, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
your, 1
eye,, 1
but, 1
could, 1
not., 1
You, 1
held, 1
her, 1
hand--you, 1
were, 1
feeling, 1
her, 1
pulse--and, 1
the, 1
second, 1
fit, 1
came, 1
on, 1
before, 1
you, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
me., 1
This, 1
was, 1
more, 1
terrible, 1
than, 1
the, 1
first;, 1
the, 1
same, 1
nervous, 1
movements, 1
were, 1
repeated,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
contracted, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
purple.", 1
"And, 1
at, 1
the, 1
third, 1
she, 1
expired.", 1
"At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
attack, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
symptoms, 1
of, 1
tetanus;, 1
you, 1
confirmed, 1
my, 1
opinion.", 1
"Yes,, 1
before, 1
others,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"but, 1
now, 1
we, 1
are, 1
alone"--, 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
say?, 1
Oh,, 1
spare, 1
me!", 1
"That, 1
the, 1
symptoms, 1
of, 1
tetanus, 1

poisoning, 1
by, 1
vegetable, 1
substances, 1
are, 1
the, 1
same.", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
started, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
then, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
fell, 1
down, 1
again,, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
motionless., 1
Morrel, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
dreaming, 1
or, 1
awake., 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
the, 1
full, 1
importance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
statement, 1

made,, 1

the, 1
disposition, 1

made, 1
it.", 1

to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
a, 1
magistrate, 1

as, 1
a, 1
friend?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort., 1
"As, 1
a, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend,, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment., 1

similarity, 1
in, 1
the, 1
symptoms, 1
of, 1
tetanus, 1
and, 1
poisoning, 1
by, 1
vegetable, 1

is, 1
so, 1
great,, 1

affirm, 1
by, 1
oath, 1

I, 1
have, 1
now, 1
stated,, 1

to, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
speak, 1
not, 1
to, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1

to, 1
a, 1
friend., 1
And, 1
to, 1
that, 1
friend, 1
I, 1
say., 1
'During, 1
the, 1
three-quarters, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
that, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
continued,, 1

watched, 1

the, 1
death, 1
of, 1

am, 1
thoroughly, 1
convinced, 1

did, 1
her, 1
death, 1
proceed, 1
from, 1
poison,, 1

it, 1
be, 1
possible?", 1

are, 1
marked,, 1

is, 1
impossible,", 1

"I, 1

and, 1
we, 1
will, 1
consult, 1
together,, 1
and, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
body.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
poison?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say, 1
of, 1
poison,, 1
but, 1
we, 1
can, 1
prove, 1
what, 1
was, 1
the, 1
state, 1
of, 1
the, 1
body;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
her, 1
sudden, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
say,, 1
'Dear, 1
Villefort,, 1
if, 1
this, 1
thing, 1
has, 1
been, 1
caused, 1
by, 1
negligence,, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
your, 1
servants;, 1
if, 1
from, 1
hatred,, 1
watch, 1
your, 1
enemies.'", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
propose, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
d'Avrigny?", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
despair;, 1
"so, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
another, 1
is, 1
admitted, 1
into, 1
our, 1
secret,, 1
an, 1
inquest, 1
will, 1
become, 1
necessary;, 1
and, 1
an, 1
inquest, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house--impossible!, 1
Still,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
with, 1
uneasiness,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
it--if, 1
you, 1
demand, 1
it,, 1
why, 1
then, 1
it, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
done., 1
But,, 1
doctor,, 1
you, 1
see, 1
me, 1
already, 1
so, 1
grieved--how, 1
can, 1
I, 1
introduce, 1
into, 1
my, 1
house, 1
so, 1
much, 1
scandal,, 1
after, 1
so, 1
much, 1
sorrow?, 1
My, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
would, 1
die, 1
of, 1
it!, 1
And, 1
I,, 1
doctor--you, 1
know, 1
a, 1
man, 1
does, 1
not, 1
arrive, 1
at, 1
the, 1
post, 1
I, 1
occupy--one, 1
has, 1
not, 1
been, 1
king's, 1
attorney, 1
twenty-five, 1
years, 1
without, 1
having, 1
amassed, 1
a, 1
tolerable, 1
number, 1
of, 1
enemies;, 1
mine, 1
are, 1
numerous., 1
Let, 1
this, 1
affair, 1
be, 1
talked, 1
of,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
triumph, 1
for, 1
them,, 1
which, 1
will, 1
make, 1
them, 1
rejoice,, 1
and, 1
cover, 1
me, 1
with, 1
shame., 1
Pardon, 1
me,, 1
doctor,, 1
these, 1
worldly, 1
ideas;, 1
were, 1
you, 1
a, 1
priest, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
dare, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
know, 1
mankind., 1
Doctor,, 1
pray, 1
recall, 1
your, 1
words;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1
have, 1
you?", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"my, 1
first, 1
duty, 1
is, 1
to, 1
humanity., 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
if, 1
science, 1
could, 1
have, 1
done, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
she, 1
is, 1
dead, 1
and, 1
my, 1
duty, 1
regards, 1
the, 1
living., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
bury, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
secret, 1
in, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
recesses, 1
of, 1
our, 1
hearts;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
willing,, 1
if, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
suspect, 1
this,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
silence, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
should, 1
be, 1
imputed, 1
to, 1
my, 1
ignorance., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
sir,, 1
watch, 1
always--watch, 1
carefully,, 1
for, 1
perhaps, 1
the, 1
evil, 1
may, 1
not, 1
stop, 1
here., 1
And, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
found, 1
the, 1
culprit,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
find, 1
him,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
say, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
'You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
do, 1
as, 1
you, 1
will!'", 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you,, 1
doctor,", 1
said, 1
Villefort, 1
with, 1
indescribable, 1
joy;, 1
"I, 1
never, 1
had, 1
a, 1
better, 1
friend, 1
than, 1
you.", 1
And,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
Doctor, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
would, 1
recall, 1
his, 1
promise,, 1
he, 1
hurried, 1
him, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
house., 1
When, 1
they, 1
were, 1
gone,, 1
Morrel, 1
ventured, 1
out, 1
from, 1
under, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
shone, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
it, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
ghost., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
manifestly, 1
protected, 1
in, 1
a, 1
most, 1
wonderful,, 1
but, 1
most, 1
terrible, 1
manner,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"but, 1
Valentine,, 1
poor, 1
girl,, 1
how, 1
will, 1
she, 1
bear, 1
so, 1
much, 1
sorrow?", 1
As, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
thus,, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
alternately, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window, 1
with, 1
red, 1
curtains, 1
and, 1
the, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
with, 1
white, 1
curtains., 1
The, 1
light, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
disappeared, 1
from, 1
the, 1
former;, 1
doubtless, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
just, 1
put, 1
out, 1
her, 1
lamp,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
nightlamp, 1
alone, 1
reflected, 1
its, 1
dull, 1
light, 1
on, 1
the, 1
window., 1
At, 1
the, 1
extremity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
building,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
windows, 1
open., 1
A, 1
wax-light, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mantle-piece, 1
threw, 1
some, 1
of, 1
its, 1
pale, 1
rays, 1
without,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
for, 1
one, 1
moment, 1
on, 1
the, 1
balcony., 1
Morrel, 1
shuddered;, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
sob., 1
It, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
wondered, 1
at, 1
that, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
generally, 1
so, 1
courageous,, 1
but, 1
now, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
two, 1
strongest, 1
human, 1
passions,, 1
love, 1
and, 1
fear,, 1
was, 1
weakened, 1
even, 1
to, 1
the, 1
indulgence, 1
of, 1
superstitious, 1
thoughts., 1
Although, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
should, 1
see, 1
him,, 1
hidden, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window, 1
call, 1
him;, 1
his, 1
disturbed, 1
mind, 1
told, 1
him, 1
so., 1
This, 1
double, 1
error, 1
became, 1
an, 1
irresistible, 1
reality,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
incomprehensible, 1
transports, 1
of, 1
youth,, 1
he, 1
bounded, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hiding-place,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
two, 1
strides,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1
seen,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
alarming, 1
Valentine,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
being, 1
discovered, 1
by, 1
some, 1
exclamation, 1
which, 1
might, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
he, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
flower-garden,, 1
which, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
large, 1
white, 1
lake,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
rows, 1
of, 1
orange-trees, 1
which, 1
extended, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
step,, 1
ran, 1
quickly, 1
up, 1
and, 1
pushed, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
opened, 1
without, 1
offering, 1
any, 1
resistance., 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
him., 1
Her, 1
eyes,, 1
raised, 1
towards, 1
heaven,, 1
were, 1
watching, 1
a, 1
silvery, 1
cloud, 1
gliding, 1
over, 1
the, 1
azure,, 1
its, 1
form, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
mounting, 1
towards, 1
heaven., 1
Her, 1
poetic, 1
and, 1
excited, 1
mind, 1
pictured, 1
it, 1
as, 1
the, 1
soul, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandmother., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
anteroom, 1
and, 1
found, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
which,, 1
being, 1
carpeted,, 1
prevented, 1
his, 1
approach, 1
being, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
regained, 1
that, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
confidence, 1
that, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
even, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
alarmed, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
any, 1
such, 1
encounter., 1
He, 1
would, 1
at, 1
once, 1
approach, 1
Valentine's, 1
father, 1
and, 1
acknowledge, 1
all,, 1
begging, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
pardon, 1
and, 1
sanction, 1
the, 1
love, 1
which, 1
united, 1
two, 1
fond, 1
and, 1
loving, 1
hearts., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
mad., 1
Happily, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
meet, 1
any, 1
one., 1
Now,, 1
especially,, 1
did, 1
he, 1
find, 1
the, 1
description, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
given, 1
of, 1
the, 1
interior, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
useful, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
safely, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
he, 1
was, 1
feeling, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
a, 1
sob, 1
indicated, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
he, 1
was, 1
to, 1
take., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
back,, 1
a, 1
door, 1
partly, 1
open, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
one, 1
in, 1
sorrow., 1
He, 1
pushed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
open, 1
and, 1
entered., 1
At, 1
the, 1
other, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
under, 1
a, 1
white, 1
sheet, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
it,, 1
lay, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
still, 1
more, 1
alarming, 1
to, 1
Morrel, 1
since, 1
the, 1
account, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
unexpectedly, 1
overheard., 1
By, 1
its, 1
side,, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
her, 1
head, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cushion, 1
of, 1
an, 1
easy-chair,, 1
was, 1
Valentine,, 1
trembling, 1
and, 1
sobbing,, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
extended, 1
above, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
clasped, 1
and, 1
stiff., 1
She, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
from, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
which, 1
remained, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
praying, 1
in, 1
accents, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
affected, 1
the, 1
most, 1
unfeeling;, 1
her, 1
words, 1
were, 1
rapid,, 1
incoherent,, 1
unintelligible,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
burning, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
grief, 1
almost, 1
stopped, 1
her, 1
utterance., 1
The, 1
moon, 1
shining, 1
through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
blinds, 1
made, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
burn, 1
paler,, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
sepulchral, 1
hue, 1
over, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
scene., 1
Morrel, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
this;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
exemplary, 1
for, 1
piety,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
easily, 1
impressed,, 1
but, 1
Valentine, 1
suffering,, 1
weeping,, 1
wringing, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
was, 1
more, 1
than, 1
he, 1
could, 1
bear, 1
in, 1
silence., 1
He, 1
sighed,, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
a, 1
name,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
head, 1
bathed, 1
in, 1
tears, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
velvet, 1
cushion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chair--a, 1
head, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Magdalen, 1
by, 1
Correggio--was, 1
raised, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
Valentine, 1
perceived, 1
him, 1
without, 1
betraying, 1
the, 1
least, 1
surprise., 1
A, 1
heart, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
one, 1
great, 1
grief, 1
is, 1
insensible, 1
to, 1
minor, 1
emotions., 1
Morrel, 1
held, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
her., 1
Valentine,, 1
as, 1
her, 1
only, 1
apology, 1
for, 1
not, 1
having, 1
met, 1
him,, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
under, 1
the, 1
sheet,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
sob, 1
again., 1
Neither, 1
dared, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
in, 1
that, 1
room., 1
They, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
break, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
which, 1
death, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
impose;, 1
at, 1
length, 1
Valentine, 1
ventured., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"how, 1
came, 1
you, 1
here?, 1
Alas,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
say, 1
you, 1
are, 1
welcome,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
death, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
way, 1
for, 1
you, 1
into, 1
this, 1
house.", 1
"Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
trembling, 1
voice,, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
waited, 1
since, 1
half-past, 1
eight,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
you, 1
come;, 1
I, 1
became, 1
uneasy,, 1
leaped, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
found, 1
my, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
when, 1
voices, 1
conversing, 1
about, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
event"--, 1
"What, 1
voices?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
Morrel, 1
shuddered, 1
as, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
could, 1
see, 1
through, 1
the, 1
sheet, 1
the, 1
extended, 1
hands,, 1
the, 1
stiff, 1
neck,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
purple, 1
lips., 1
"Your, 1
servants,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"who, 1
were, 1
repeating, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sorrowful, 1
story;, 1
from, 1
them, 1
I, 1
learned, 1
it, 1
all.", 1
"But, 1
it, 1
was, 1
risking, 1
the, 1
failure, 1
of, 1
our, 1
plan, 1
to, 1
come, 1
up, 1
here,, 1
love.", 1
"Forgive, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
away.", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"you, 1
might, 1
meet, 1
some, 1
one;, 1
stay.", 1
"But, 1
if, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
come, 1
here"--, 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
shook, 1
her, 1
head., 1
"No, 1
one, 1
will, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
fear,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
our, 1
safeguard,", 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
"But, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay?", 1
replied, 1
Morrel., 1
"M., 1
Franz, 1
arrived, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
just, 1
as, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
grandmother, 1
was, 1
dying.", 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
selfish, 1
joy;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
death, 1
would, 1
cause, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
to, 1
be, 1
postponed, 1
indefinitely., 1
"But, 1
what, 1
redoubles, 1
my, 1
sorrow,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
this, 1
feeling, 1
was, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
its, 1
immediate, 1
punishment,, 1
"is, 1
that, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
old, 1
lady,, 1
on, 1
her, 1
death-bed,, 1
requested, 1
that, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
might, 1
take, 1
place, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible;, 1
she, 1
also,, 1
thinking, 1
to, 1
protect, 1
me,, 1
was, 1
acting, 1
against, 1
me.", 1
"Hark!", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
They, 1
both, 1
listened;, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
distinctly, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corridor, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
just, 1
left, 1
his, 1
study.", 1
"To, 1
accompany, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,", 1
added, 1
Morrel., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
doctor?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine,, 1
astonished., 1
"I, 1
imagined, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
Valentine, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
street, 1
door, 1
close,, 1
then, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
locked, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
up-stairs., 1
He, 1
stopped, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
anteroom,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
hesitating, 1
whether, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
apartment, 1
or, 1
into, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's;, 1
Morrel, 1
concealed, 1
himself, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
door;, 1
Valentine, 1
remained, 1
motionless,, 1
grief, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
deprive, 1
her, 1
of, 1
all, 1
fear., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
room., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
neither, 1
go, 1
out, 1
by, 1
the, 1
front, 1
door, 1
nor, 1
by, 1
the, 1
garden.", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
astonishment., 1
"There, 1
is, 1
but, 1
one, 1
way, 1
left, 1
you, 1
that, 1
is, 1
safe,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
through, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
room.", 1
She, 1
rose,, 1
"Come,", 1
she, 1
added.--"Where?", 1
asked, 1
Maximilian., 1
"To, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
room.", 1
"I, 1
in, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
apartment?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Can, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
it,, 1
Valentine?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
long, 1
wished, 1
it;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
my, 1
only, 1
remaining, 1
friend, 1
and, 1
we, 1
both, 1
need, 1
his, 1
help,--come.", 1
"Be, 1
careful,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
hesitating, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
wishes;, 1
"I, 1
now, 1
see, 1
my, 1
error--I, 1
acted, 1
like, 1
a, 1
madman, 1
in, 1
coming, 1
in, 1
here., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
sure, 1
you, 1
are, 1
more, 1
reasonable?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
scruple,--that, 1
of, 1
leaving, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
grandmother's, 1
remains,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
had, 1
undertaken, 1
to, 1
watch.", 1
"Valentine,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"death, 1
is, 1
in, 1
itself, 1
sacred.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"besides,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
for, 1
long.", 1
She, 1
then, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
and, 1
led, 1
the, 1
way, 1
down, 1
a, 1
narrow, 1
staircase, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
room;, 1
Morrel, 1
followed, 1
her, 1
on, 1
tiptoe;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
they, 1
found, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant., 1
"Barrois,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"shut, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
no, 1
one, 1
come, 1
in.", 1
She, 1
passed, 1
first., 1
Noirtier,, 1
seated, 1
in, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
every, 1
sound,, 1
was, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
brightened., 1
There, 1
was, 1
something, 1
grave, 1
and, 1
solemn, 1
in, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
which, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
his, 1
bright, 1
eye, 1
began, 1
to, 1
interrogate., 1
"Dear, 1
grandfather.", 1
said, 1
she, 1
hurriedly,, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
poor, 1
grandmamma, 1
died, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
since,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
friend, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
but, 1
you.", 1
His, 1
expressive, 1
eyes, 1
evinced, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
tenderness., 1
"To, 1
you, 1
alone,, 1
then,, 1
may, 1
I, 1
confide, 1
my, 1
sorrows, 1
and, 1
my, 1
hopes?", 1
The, 1
paralytic, 1
motioned, 1
"Yes.", 1
Valentine, 1
took, 1
Maximilian's, 1
hand., 1
"Look, 1
attentively,, 1
then,, 1
at, 1
this, 1
gentleman.", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
scrutinizing, 1
gaze, 1
with, 1
slight, 1
astonishment, 1
on, 1
Morrel., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
M., 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
that, 1
good, 1
merchant, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
doubtless, 1
recollect.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"He, 1
brings, 1
an, 1
irreproachable, 1
name,, 1
which, 1
Maximilian, 1
is, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
render, 1
glorious,, 1
since, 1
at, 1
thirty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
captain,, 1
an, 1
officer, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor.", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
signified, 1
that, 1
he, 1
recollected, 1
him., 1
"Well,, 1
grandpapa,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
kneeling, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"I, 1
love, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
be, 1
only, 1
his;, 1
were, 1
I, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
another,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
destroy, 1
myself.", 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
tumultuous, 1
thoughts., 1
"You, 1
like, 1
M., 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
grandpapa?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
will, 1
protect, 1
us,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
your, 1
children,, 1
against, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father?"--Noirtier, 1
cast, 1
an, 1
intelligent, 1
glance, 1
at, 1
Morrel,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"perhaps, 1
I, 1
may.", 1
Maximilian, 1
understood, 1
him., 1
"Mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
a, 1
sacred, 1
duty, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
in, 1
your, 1
deceased, 1
grandmother's, 1
room,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes', 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eye., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
anxiously, 1
at, 1
Valentine., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
fear, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1
understand?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Oh,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
so, 1
often, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
exactly, 1
how, 1
I, 1
talk, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Maximilian,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
adorable, 1
smile;, 1
although, 1
shaded, 1
by, 1
sorrow,--"He, 1
knows, 1
everything, 1
I, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
she., 1
Valentine, 1
arose,, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
for, 1
Morrel,, 1
requested, 1
Barrois, 1
not, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
any, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
tenderly, 1
embraced, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
and, 1
sorrowfully, 1
taken, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
Morrel,, 1
she, 1
went, 1
away., 1
To, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
Noirtier, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
Valentine's, 1
confidence, 1
and, 1
knew, 1
all, 1
their, 1
secrets,, 1
Morrel, 1
took, 1
the, 1
dictionary,, 1
a, 1
pen,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
them, 1
all, 1
on, 1
a, 1
table, 1
where, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
light., 1
"But, 1
first,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"allow, 1
me,, 1
sir,, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
who, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
how, 1
much, 1
I, 1
love, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
are, 1
my, 1
designs, 1
respecting, 1
her.", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
listen., 1
It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
imposing, 1
sight, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
this, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
apparently, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
useless, 1
burden,, 1
becoming, 1
the, 1
sole, 1
protector,, 1
support,, 1
and, 1
adviser, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lovers, 1
who, 1
were, 1
both, 1
young,, 1
beautiful,, 1
and, 1
strong., 1
His, 1
remarkably, 1
noble, 1
and, 1
austere, 1
expression, 1
struck, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
began, 1
his, 1
story, 1
with, 1
trembling., 1
He, 1
related, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
become, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
how, 1
he, 1
had, 1
loved, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
Valentine,, 1
in, 1
her, 1
solitude, 1
and, 1
her, 1
misfortune,, 1
had, 1
accepted, 1
the, 1
offer, 1
of, 1
his, 1
devotion., 1
He, 1
told, 1
him, 1
his, 1
birth,, 1
his, 1
position,, 1
his, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
consulted, 1
the, 1
look, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic,, 1
that, 1
look, 1
answered,, 1
"That, 1
is, 1
good,, 1
proceed.", 1
"And, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
the, 1
first, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
recital,, 1
"now, 1
I, 1
have, 1
told, 1
you, 1
of, 1
my, 1
love, 1

my, 1
hopes,, 1
may, 1
I, 1
inform, 1
you, 1
of, 1
my, 1
intentions?", 1
"Yes,", 1
signified, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"This, 1
was, 1
our, 1
resolution;, 1
a, 1
cabriolet, 1
was, 1
in, 1
waiting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
I, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
carry, 1
off, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
my, 1
sister's, 1
house,, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
respectfully, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
pardon.", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Noirtier., 1
"We, 1
must, 1
not, 1
do, 1
so?", 1
"No.", 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
sanction, 1
our, 1
project?", 1
"No.", 1
"There, 1
is, 1
another, 1
way,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
interrogative, 1
eye, 1
said,, 1
"What?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
go,", 1
continued, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
seek, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay--I, 1
am, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
mention, 1
this, 1
in, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
absence--and, 1
will, 1
conduct, 1
myself, 1
toward, 1
him, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
compel, 1
him, 1
to, 1
challenge, 1
me.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
look, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
interrogate., 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
will, 1
do?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
find, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you., 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
the, 1
ties, 1
which, 1
bind, 1
me, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine;, 1
if, 1
he, 1
be, 1
a, 1
sensible, 1
man,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
prove, 1
it, 1
by, 1
renouncing, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
accord, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
his, 1
betrothed,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
secure, 1
my, 1
friendship,, 1
and, 1
love, 1
until, 1
death;, 1
if, 1
he, 1
refuse,, 1
either, 1
through, 1
interest, 1
or, 1
ridiculous, 1
pride,, 1
after, 1
I, 1
have, 1
proved, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
forcing, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
from, 1
me,, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
loves, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
have, 1
no, 1
other,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
fight, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
give, 1
him, 1
every, 1
advantage,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
kill, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
he, 1
will, 1
kill, 1
me;, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
victorious,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
not, 1

and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
die,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
sure, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
not, 1
marry, 1
him.", 1
Noirtier, 1
watched,, 1
with, 1
indescribable, 1
pleasure,, 1
this, 1
noble, 1
and, 1
sincere, 1
countenance,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
every, 1
sentiment, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
uttered, 1
was, 1
depicted,, 1
adding, 1
by, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fine, 1
features, 1
all, 1
that, 1
coloring, 1
adds, 1
to, 1
a, 1
sound, 1
and, 1
faithful, 1
drawing., 1
Still,, 1
when, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
he, 1
shut, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
several, 1
times,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
his, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
saying, 1
"No.", 1
"No?", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"you, 1
disapprove, 1
of, 1
this, 1
second, 1
project,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
did, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first?", 1
"I, 1
do,", 1
signified, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"But, 1
what, 1
then, 1
must, 1
be, 1
done?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
last, 1
request, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
delayed;, 1
must, 1
I, 1
let, 1
things, 1

their, 1
course?", 1
Noirtier, 1
did, 1
not, 1
move., 1
"I, 1
understand,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
to, 1

"Yes.", 1
"But, 1
delay, 1
may, 1
ruin, 1
our, 1
plan,, 1

replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Alone,, 1
Valentine, 1
has, 1
no, 1
power;, 1
she, 1
will, 1

hope, 1
for, 1
so, 1
good, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
to, 1

again., 1
Believe, 1
me,, 1
there, 1
are, 1
only, 1
the, 1
two, 1
plans, 1
I, 1
have, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
forgive, 1
my, 1
vanity,, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
which, 1
you, 1
prefer., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
authorize, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
intrust, 1
herself, 1
to, 1
my, 1
honor?", 1
"No.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1

should, 1
seek, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay?", 1
"No.", 1
"Whence, 1

will, 1
come, 1
the, 1
help, 1
we, 1
need--from, 1
chance?", 1
resumed, 1
Morrel., 1
"No.", 1
"From, 1
you?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
thoroughly, 1
understand, 1
me,, 1
sir?, 1
Pardon, 1
my, 1
eagerness,, 1
for, 1
my, 1
life, 1
depends, 1
on, 1
your, 1
answer., 1
Will, 1

from, 1
you?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
so, 1
much, 1
firmness, 1
in, 1
the, 1
look, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
this, 1
answer,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could,, 1
at, 1
any, 1
rate,, 1
doubt, 1
his, 1
will,, 1
if, 1

did, 1
his, 1
power., 1
"Oh,, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
times!, 1

a, 1
miracle, 1
should, 1
restore, 1
your, 1
speech,, 1
your, 1

how, 1
can, 1
you,, 1
chained, 1
to, 1
that, 1
arm-chair,, 1
dumb, 1
and, 1
motionless,, 1
oppose, 1
this, 1
marriage?", 1
A, 1
smile, 1
lit, 1
up, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
face,, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
in, 1
a, 1
paralyzed, 1
face., 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
must, 1
wait?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Yes.", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
contract?", 1
The, 1
same, 1
smile, 1
returned., 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
assure, 1
me, 1
it, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
signed?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Noirtier., 1
"The, 1
contract, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
be, 1
signed!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel., 1
"Oh,, 1
pardon, 1
me,, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
can, 1
scarcely, 1
realize, 1
so, 1
great, 1
a, 1
happiness., 1
Will, 1
they, 1
not, 1
sign, 1
it?", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
paralytic., 1
Notwithstanding, 1
that, 1
assurance,, 1
Morrel, 1
still, 1
hesitated., 1
This, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
an, 1
impotent, 1
old, 1
man, 1
was, 1
so, 1
strange, 1
that,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
being, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
his, 1
will,, 1
it, 1
might, 1
emanate, 1
from, 1
enfeebled, 1
organs., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
natural, 1
that, 1
the, 1
madman,, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
his, 1
folly,, 1
should, 1
attempt, 1
things, 1
beyond, 1
his, 1
power?, 1
The, 1
weak, 1
man, 1
talks, 1
of, 1
burdens, 1
he, 1
can, 1
raise,, 1
the, 1
timid, 1
of, 1
giants, 1
he, 1
can, 1
confront,, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
of, 1
treasures, 1
he, 1
spends,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
humble, 1
peasant,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
height, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pride,, 1
calls, 1
himself, 1
Jupiter., 1
Whether, 1
Noirtier, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
indecision,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
full, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
his, 1
docility,, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
uneasily, 1
at, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel;, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
renew, 1
my, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
remaining, 1
tranquil?", 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye, 1
remained, 1
fixed, 1
and, 1
firm,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
imply, 1
that, 1
a, 1
promise, 1
did, 1
not, 1
suffice;, 1
then, 1
it, 1
passed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
face, 1
to, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
paralytic, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
solemnity., 1
Morrel, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
attached, 1
great, 1
importance, 1
to, 1
an, 1
oath., 1
He, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"to, 1
await, 1
your, 1
decision, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
course, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
pursue, 1
with, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
retire?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Without, 1
seeing, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Morrel, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
obey., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"first, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
embrace, 1
you, 1
as, 1
your, 1
daughter, 1
did, 1
just, 1
now.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
expression, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
understood., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
spot,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
forehead,, 1
where, 1
Valentine's, 1
had, 1
been., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time, 1
and, 1
retired., 1
He, 1
found, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
door, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
given, 1
directions., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
conducted, 1
along, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
passage,, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
a, 1
little, 1
door, 1
opening, 1
on, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
soon, 1
found, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
assistance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
shrubs, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
his, 1
ladder, 1
was, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
in, 1
the, 1
clover-field, 1
where, 1
his, 1
cabriolet, 1
was, 1
still, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him., 1
He, 1
got, 1
in, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
thoroughly, 1
wearied, 1
by, 1
so, 1
many, 1
emotions,, 1
arrived, 1
about, 1
midnight, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
slept, 1
soundly., 1
Chapter, 1
74., 1
The, 1
Villefort, 1
Family, 1
Vault., 1
Two, 1
days, 1
after,, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
crowd, 1
was, 1
assembled,, 1
towards, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
around, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
long, 1
file, 1
of, 1
mourning-coaches, 1
and, 1
private, 1
carriages, 1
extended, 1
along, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Pepiniere., 1
Among, 1
them, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
a, 1
very, 1
singular, 1
form,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
come, 1
from, 1
a, 1
distance., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
covered, 1
wagon,, 1
painted, 1
black,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
arrive., 1
Inquiry, 1
was, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
ascertained, 1
that,, 1
by, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
coincidence,, 1
this, 1
carriage, 1
contained, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Marquis, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
thinking, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
one, 1
funeral, 1
would, 1
follow, 1
two., 1
Their, 1
number, 1
was, 1
great., 1
The, 1
Marquis, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
zealous, 1
and, 1
faithful, 1
dignitaries, 1
of, 1
Louis, 1
XVIII., 1
and, 1
King, 1
Charles, 1
X.,, 1
had, 1
preserved, 1
a, 1
great, 1
number, 1
of, 1
friends,, 1
and, 1
these,, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
personages, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
usages, 1
of, 1
society, 1
gave, 1
Villefort, 1
a, 1
claim, 1
on,, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
body., 1
Due, 1
information, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
the, 1
authorities,, 1
and, 1
permission, 1
obtained, 1
that, 1
the, 1
two, 1
funerals, 1
should, 1
take, 1
place, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time., 1
A, 1
second, 1
hearse,, 1
decked, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
funereal, 1
pomp,, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
coffin, 1
removed, 1
into, 1
it, 1
from, 1
the, 1
post-wagon., 1
The, 1
two, 1
bodies, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
interred, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cemetery, 1
of, 1
Pere-la-Chaise,, 1
where, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
long, 1
since, 1
had, 1
a, 1
tomb, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
the, 1
reception, 1
of, 1
his, 1
family., 1
The, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Renee, 1
were, 1
already, 1
deposited, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
now,, 1
after, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
of, 1
separation,, 1
her, 1
father, 1
and, 1
mother, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
reunited, 1
with, 1
her., 1
The, 1
Parisians,, 1
always, 1
curious,, 1
always, 1
affected, 1
by, 1
funereal, 1
display,, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
with, 1
religious, 1
silence, 1
while, 1
the, 1
splendid, 1
procession, 1
accompanied, 1
to, 1
their, 1
last, 1
abode, 1
two, 1
of, 1
the, 1
number, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
aristocracy--the, 1
greatest, 1
protectors, 1
of, 1
commerce, 1
and, 1
sincere, 1
devotees, 1
to, 1
their, 1
principles., 1
In, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mourning-coaches, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
Debray,, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
were, 1
talking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
very, 1
sudden, 1
death, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marchioness., 1
"I, 1
saw, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
only, 1
last, 1
year, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
back, 1
from, 1
Algiers,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"she, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
destined, 1
to, 1
live, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
from, 1
her, 1
apparent, 1
sound, 1
health, 1
and, 1
great, 1
activity, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
and, 1
body., 1
How, 1
old, 1
was, 1
she?", 1
"Franz, 1
assured, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
"that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
sixty-six, 1
years, 1
old., 1
But, 1
she, 1
has, 1
not, 1
died, 1
of, 1
old, 1
age,, 1
but, 1
of, 1
grief;, 1
it, 1
appears, 1
that, 1
since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marquis,, 1
which, 1
affected, 1
her, 1
very, 1
deeply,, 1
she, 1
has, 1
not, 1
completely, 1
recovered, 1
her, 1
reason.", 1
"But, 1
of, 1
what, 1
disease,, 1
then,, 1
did, 1
she, 1
die?", 1
asked, 1
Debray., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
said, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
congestion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brain,, 1
or, 1
apoplexy,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Nearly.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
apoplexy,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
once, 1
saw,, 1
was, 1
short,, 1
of, 1
slender, 1
form,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
a, 1
much, 1
more, 1
nervous, 1
than, 1
sanguine, 1
temperament;, 1
grief, 1
could, 1
hardly, 1
produce, 1
apoplexy, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
constitution, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran.", 1
"At, 1
any, 1
rate,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"whatever, 1
disease, 1
or, 1
doctor, 1
may, 1
have, 1
killed, 1
her,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
or, 1
rather,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine,--or,, 1
still, 1
rather,, 1
our, 1
friend, 1
Franz,, 1

a, 1
magnificent, 1
fortune,, 1
amounting,, 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
to, 1
80,000, 1
livres, 1
per, 1
annum.", 1
"And, 1
this, 1
fortune, 1
will, 1
be, 1
doubled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
Jacobin,, 1
Noirtier.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
a, 1
tenacious, 1
old, 1
grandfather,", 1

Beauchamp., 1
"Tenacem, 1
propositi, 1

appeared, 1
the, 1
same, 1
to, 1
him., 1
One, 1
thing, 1
only, 1
puzzles, 1
me,, 1
namely,, 1
how, 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay, 1
will, 1
like, 1
a, 1
grandfather, 1
who, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
But, 1
where, 1
is, 1
Franz?", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
carriage,, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
considers, 1
him, 1
already, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family.", 1
Such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
in, 1
almost, 1
all, 1
the, 1
carriages;, 1
these, 1
two, 1
sudden, 1
deaths,, 1
so, 1
quickly, 1
following, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
astonished, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
suspected, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
secret, 1
which, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
had, 1
communicated,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
nocturnal, 1
walk, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
They, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
about, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
at, 1
the, 1
cemetery;, 1
the, 1
weather, 1
was, 1
mild,, 1
but, 1
dull,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
harmony, 1
with, 1
the, 1
funeral, 1
ceremony., 1
Among, 1
the, 1
groups, 1
which, 1
flocked, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
family, 1
vault,, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
recognized, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cabriolet,, 1
and, 1
walked, 1
silently, 1
along, 1
the, 1
path, 1
bordered, 1
with, 1
yew-trees., 1
"You, 1
here?", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
passing, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
through, 1
the, 1
young, 1
captain's;, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
Villefort's?, 1
How, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
met, 1
you, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
acquaintance, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's.", 1
answered, 1
Morrel,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran.", 1
Albert, 1
came, 1
up, 1
to, 1
them, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
with, 1
Franz., 1
"The, 1
time, 1
and, 1
place, 1
are, 1
but, 1
ill-suited, 1
for, 1
an, 1
introduction.", 1
said, 1
Albert;, 1
"but, 1
we, 1
are, 1
not, 1
superstitious., 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
present, 1
to, 1
you, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
travelling, 1
companion,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
made, 1
the, 1
tour, 1
of, 1
Italy., 1
My, 1
dear, 1
Franz,, 1
M., 1
Maximilian, 1
Morrel,, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
friend, 1
I, 1
have, 1
acquired, 1
in, 1
your, 1
absence,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
you, 1
will, 1
hear, 1
me, 1
mention, 1
every, 1
time, 1
I, 1
make, 1
any, 1
allusion, 1
to, 1
affection,, 1
wit,, 1
or, 1
amiability.", 1
Morrel, 1
hesitated, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
hypocritical, 1
to, 1
accost, 1
in, 1
a, 1
friendly, 1
manner, 1
the, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
tacitly, 1
opposing,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
oath, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gravity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
recurred, 1
to, 1
his, 1
memory;, 1
he, 1
struggled, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
his, 1
emotion, 1
and, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
Franz., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
sorrow,, 1
is, 1
she, 1
not?", 1
said, 1
Debray, 1
to, 1
Franz., 1
"Extremely,", 1
replied, 1
he;, 1
"she, 1
looked, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
I, 1
scarcely, 1
knew, 1
her.", 1
These, 1
apparently, 1
simple, 1
words, 1
pierced, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
This, 1
man, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
her!, 1
The, 1
young, 1
and, 1
high-spirited, 1
officer, 1
required, 1
all, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
breaking, 1
his, 1
oath., 1
He, 1
took, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
vault,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
attendants, 1
had, 1
already, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
two, 1
coffins., 1
"This, 1
is, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
habitation,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
looking, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
mausoleum;, 1
"a, 1
summer, 1
and, 1
winter, 1
palace., 1
You, 1
will,, 1
in, 1
turn,, 1
enter, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
be, 1
numbered, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family., 1
I,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
philosopher,, 1
should, 1
like, 1
a, 1
little, 1
country-house,, 1
a, 1
cottage, 1
down, 1
there, 1
under, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
without, 1
so, 1
many, 1
free-stones, 1
over, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
body., 1
In, 1
dying,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
say, 1
to, 1
those, 1
around, 1
me, 1
what, 1
Voltaire, 1
wrote, 1
to, 1
Piron:, 1
'Eo, 1
rus,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
will, 1
be, 1
over.', 1
But, 1
come,, 1
Franz,, 1
take, 1
courage,, 1
your, 1
wife, 1
is, 1
an, 1
heiress.", 1
"Indeed,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
unbearable., 1
Politics, 1
has, 1
made, 1
you, 1
laugh, 1
at, 1
everything,, 1
and, 1
political, 1
men, 1
have, 1
made, 1
you, 1
disbelieve, 1
everything., 1
But, 1
when, 1
you, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
associating, 1
with, 1
ordinary, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
leaving, 1
politics, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
try, 1
to, 1
find, 1
your, 1
affectionate, 1
heart,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
with, 1
your, 1
stick, 1
when, 1
you, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Chamber.", 1
"But, 1
tell, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
life?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
a, 1
hall, 1
in, 1
Death's, 1
anteroom?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
prejudiced, 1
against, 1
Beauchamp,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
drawing, 1
Franz, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
former, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
his, 1
philosophical, 1
dissertation, 1
with, 1
Debray., 1
The, 1
Villefort, 1
vault, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
square, 1
of, 1
white, 1
stones,, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
feet, 1
high;, 1
an, 1
interior, 1
partition, 1
separated, 1
the, 1
two, 1
families,, 1
and, 1
each, 1
apartment, 1
had, 1
its, 1
entrance, 1
door., 1
Here, 1
were, 1
not,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
other, 1
tombs,, 1
ignoble, 1
drawers,, 1
one, 1
above, 1
another,, 1
where, 1
thrift, 1
bestows, 1
its, 1
dead, 1
and, 1
labels, 1
them, 1
like, 1
specimens, 1
in, 1
a, 1
museum;, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
visible, 1
within, 1
the, 1
bronze, 1
gates, 1
was, 1
a, 1
gloomy-looking, 1
room,, 1
separated, 1
by, 1
a, 1
wall, 1
from, 1
the, 1
vault, 1
itself., 1
The, 1
two, 1
doors, 1
before, 1
mentioned, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
this, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
enclosed, 1
the, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
coffins., 1
There, 1
grief, 1
might, 1
freely, 1
expend, 1
itself, 1
without, 1
being, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
trifling, 1
loungers, 1
who, 1
came, 1
from, 1
a, 1
picnic, 1
party, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
Pere-la-Chaise,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
lovers, 1
who, 1
make, 1
it, 1
their, 1
rendezvous., 1
The, 1
two, 1
coffins, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
trestles, 1
previously, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
their, 1
reception, 1
in, 1
the, 1
right-hand, 1
crypt, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
family., 1
Villefort,, 1
Franz,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
few, 1
near, 1
relatives, 1
alone, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
sanctuary., 1
As, 1
the, 1
religious, 1
ceremonies, 1
had, 1
all, 1
been, 1
performed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
address, 1
given,, 1
the, 1
party, 1
all, 1
separated;, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
Morrel,, 1
went, 1
one, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
Debray, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp, 1
the, 1
other., 1
Franz, 1
remained, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cemetery,, 1
Morrel, 1
made, 1
an, 1
excuse, 1
to, 1
wait;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
get, 1
into, 1
the, 1
same, 1
mourning, 1
coach,, 1
and, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
meeting, 1
forboded, 1
evil., 1
He, 1
then, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
although, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Albert,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
one, 1
word, 1
of, 1
their, 1
conversation., 1
As, 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
take, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"When, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
latter., 1
"At, 1
what, 1
time, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
"As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
command,, 1
sir;, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
return, 1
together?", 1
"If, 1
not, 1
unpleasant, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
feel, 1
much, 1
pleasure.", 1
Thus,, 1
the, 1
future, 1
father, 1
and, 1
son-in-law, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
same, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
Morrel,, 1
seeing, 1
them, 1
pass,, 1
became, 1
uneasy., 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore., 1
The, 1
procureur,, 1
without, 1
going, 1
to, 1
see, 1
either, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
or, 1
his, 1
daughter,, 1
went, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
and,, 1
offering, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
a, 1
chair,--"M., 1
d'Epinay,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
remind, 1
you, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,--which, 1
is, 1
perhaps, 1
not, 1
so, 1
ill-chosen, 1
as, 1
at, 1
first, 1
sight, 1
may, 1
appear,, 1
for, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1

departed, 1

first, 1

should, 1
be, 1
made, 1
at, 1
their, 1
tomb,--allow, 1
me, 1
then, 1
to, 1
remind, 1
you, 1
of, 1

wish, 1
expressed, 1
by, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
on, 1
her, 1
death-bed,, 1
that, 1
Valentine's, 1

of, 1

the, 1
Saint-Meran, 1

the, 1
notary, 1
showed, 1
me, 1
the, 1
documents, 1
yesterday,, 1
which, 1
will, 1
enable, 1
us, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
up, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
immediately., 1
You, 1
may, 1
call, 1
on, 1
the, 1
notary,, 1
M., 1
Deschamps,, 1
Place, 1
Beauveau,, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore,, 1

deeds.", 1
"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not,, 1
perhaps,, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine,, 1

is, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
distress,, 1

fear"--, 1
"Valentine, 1
will, 1

no, 1
greater, 1
pleasure, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
fulfilling, 1
her, 1
grandmother's, 1

injunctions;, 1
there, 1
will, 1
be, 1
no, 1
obstacle, 1
from, 1
that, 1
quarter,, 1

assure, 1
you.", 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case,", 1
replied, 1
Franz,, 1
"as, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
raise, 1
none,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
make, 1
arrangements, 1
when, 1

Villefort,, 1
"nothing, 1

mourning?", 1

Franz,, 1
hesitating., 1
"Don't, 1
be, 1
uneasy, 1

that, 1
score,", 1

Villefort;, 1
"no, 1

in, 1
a, 1
week.", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
one, 1
request, 1
to, 1
make.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
and, 1
Raoul, 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
to, 1
be, 1
present, 1
at, 1
this, 1
signature;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
they, 1
are, 1
my, 1
witnesses.", 1
"Half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
will, 1
suffice, 1
to, 1
apprise, 1
them;, 1
will, 1
you, 1
go, 1
for, 1
them, 1
yourself,, 1
or, 1
shall, 1
you, 1
send?", 1
"I, 1
prefer, 1
going,, 1
sir.", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
expect, 1
you,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
baron,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
be, 1
ready.", 1
Franz, 1
bowed, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
the, 1
door, 1
closed,, 1
when, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
in, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
expected, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
and, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
and, 1
his, 1
witnesses., 1
The, 1
news, 1
caused, 1
a, 1
great, 1
sensation, 1
throughout, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
would, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
thunderstruck., 1
She, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
help,, 1
and, 1
would, 1
have, 1
gone, 1
down, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandfather's, 1
room,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
she, 1
met, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
took, 1
her, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
led, 1
her, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room., 1
In, 1
the, 1
anteroom,, 1
Valentine, 1
met, 1
Barrois,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
despairingly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
later,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
with, 1
her, 1
little, 1
Edward., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
shared, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
for, 1
she, 1
was, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
fatigued., 1
She, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
took, 1
Edward, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
pressed, 1
this, 1
child,, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
her, 1
affections, 1
appeared, 1
centred,, 1
almost, 1
convulsively, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bosom., 1
Two, 1
carriages, 1
were, 1
soon, 1
heard, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
court, 1
yard., 1
One, 1
was, 1
the, 1
notary's;, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
his, 1
friends., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
party, 1
was, 1
assembled., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
one, 1
might, 1
trace, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
veins, 1
from, 1
her, 1
temples,, 1
round, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
down, 1
her, 1
cheeks., 1
Franz, 1
was, 1
deeply, 1
affected., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other, 1
with, 1
amazement;, 1
the, 1
ceremony, 1
which, 1
was, 1
just, 1
concluded, 1
had, 1
not, 1
appeared, 1
more, 1
sorrowful, 1
than, 1
did, 1
that, 1
which, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
velvet, 1
curtain,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
she, 1
constantly, 1
bent, 1
over, 1
her, 1
child,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
read, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
her, 1
face., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
unmoved., 1
The, 1
notary,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
customary, 1
method, 1
arranged, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
taken, 1
his, 1
place, 1
in, 1
an, 1
armchair,, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
spectacles,, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
Franz:, 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
de, 1
Quesnel,, 1
baron, 1
d'Epinay?", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
it, 1
perfectly., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Franz., 1
The, 1
notary, 1
bowed., 1
"I, 1
have,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
inform, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
request, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
that, 1
your, 1
projected, 1
marriage, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
has, 1
changed, 1
the, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
grandchild,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
disinherits, 1
her, 1
entirely, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fortune, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
left, 1
her., 1
Let, 1
me, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
add,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
testator,, 1
having, 1
only, 1
the, 1
right, 1
to, 1
alienate, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
alienated, 1
it, 1
all,, 1
the, 1
will, 1
will, 1
not, 1
bear, 1
scrutiny,, 1
and, 1
is, 1
declared, 1
null, 1
and, 1
void.", 1
"Yes.", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
warn, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
that, 1
during, 1
my, 1
life-time, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
will, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
be, 1
questioned,, 1
my, 1
position, 1
forbidding, 1
any, 1
doubt, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entertained.", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"I, 1
regret, 1
much, 1
that, 1
such, 1
a, 1
question, 1
has, 1
been, 1
raised, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
her, 1
fortune,, 1
which,, 1
however, 1
limited, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be,, 1
exceeds, 1
mine., 1
My, 1
family, 1
has, 1
sought, 1
consideration, 1
in, 1
this, 1
alliance, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
all, 1
I, 1
seek, 1
is, 1
happiness.", 1
Valentine, 1
imperceptibly, 1
thanked, 1
him,, 1
while, 1
two, 1
silent, 1
tears, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
her, 1
cheeks., 1
"Besides,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
addressing, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
his, 1
future, 1
son-in-law,, 1
"excepting, 1
the, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
your, 1
hopes,, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
will, 1
need, 1
not, 1
personally, 1
wound, 1
you;, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
weakness, 1
of, 1
mind, 1
sufficiently, 1
explains, 1
it., 1
It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
because, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
you, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
angry,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
she, 1
will, 1
marry,, 1
a, 1
union, 1
with, 1
any, 1
other, 1
would, 1
have, 1
caused, 1
him, 1
the, 1

sorrow., 1
Old, 1
age, 1
is, 1
selfish,, 1

Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1

she, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
when, 1
she, 1
becomes, 1
the, 1
Baroness, 1
d'Epinay., 1
My, 1
father's, 1
melancholy, 1
state, 1
prevents, 1

speaking, 1
to, 1
him, 1
on, 1
any, 1
subjects,, 1

the, 1
weakness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
would, 1
incapacitate, 1
him, 1
from, 1

M., 1
de, 1

had, 1
scarcely, 1
said, 1
this,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Barrois, 1
appeared., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
strangely, 1
firm, 1
for, 1
a, 1
servant, 1

to, 1
his, 1
masters, 1
under, 1
such, 1
solemn, 1
circumstances,--"gentlemen,, 1

might, 1
be, 1
no, 1

Villefort, 1
started,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1

her, 1
son, 1
slip, 1
from, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
Valentine, 1
rose,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
dumb, 1
as, 1
a, 1
statue., 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
second, 1
look,, 1
more, 1
full, 1
of, 1
amazement, 1
than, 1
the, 1
first., 1
The, 1
notary, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Villefort., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
impossible,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur., 1
"M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
cannot, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
at, 1
present.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,", 1
replied, 1
Barrois, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
firmness,, 1
"that, 1

"Grandpapa, 1
Noirtier, 1
can, 1
speak, 1
now,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Edward,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
habitual, 1
quickness., 1
However,, 1
his, 1
remark, 1
did, 1
not, 1
make, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
even, 1
smile,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
was, 1
every, 1
mind, 1
engaged,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
solemn, 1
was, 1
the, 1
situation., 1
Astonishment, 1
was, 1
at, 1
its, 1
height., 1
Something, 1
like, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
was, 1
perceptible, 1
on, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
countenance., 1
Valentine, 1
instinctively, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
thank, 1
heaven., 1
"Pray, 1
go,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said;, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"and, 1
see, 1
what, 1
this, 1
new, 1
fancy, 1
of, 1
your, 1
grandfather's, 1
is.", 1
Valentine, 1
rose, 1
quickly,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
hastening, 1
joyfully, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
when, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
altered, 1
his, 1
intention., 1
"Stop,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Franz,, 1
"since, 1

sent, 1
for, 1

ready, 1

besides,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
happy, 1

pay, 1
my, 1
respects, 1

"Pray,, 1

Villefort, 1
with, 1
marked, 1
uneasiness,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
disturb, 1
yourself.", 1
"Forgive, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Franz, 1
in, 1
a, 1
resolute, 1
tone., 1
"I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
this, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
proving, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
how, 1
wrong, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
of, 1
him, 1
to, 1

determined, 1
to, 1

by, 1
my, 1
devotion.", 1
And, 1
without, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
Villefort, 1
he, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
followed, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
running, 1
down-stairs, 1
with, 1
the, 1
joy, 1
of, 1
a, 1
shipwrecked, 1
mariner, 1
who, 1
finds, 1
a, 1
rock, 1
to, 1
cling, 1
to., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
followed, 1
them., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Morcerf, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
third, 1
look, 1
of, 1
still, 1
increasing, 1
wonder., 1
Chapter, 1
75., 1
A, 1
Signed, 1
Statement., 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
them,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
and, 1
installed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arm-chair., 1
When, 1
the, 1
three, 1
persons, 1
he, 1
expected, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
immediately, 1
closed., 1
"Listen,", 1
whispered, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
not, 1
conceal, 1
her, 1
joy;, 1
"if, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
communicate, 1
anything, 1
which, 1
would, 1
delay, 1
your, 1
marriage,, 1
I, 1
forbid, 1
you, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
him.", 1
Valentine, 1
blushed,, 1
but, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
Villefort,, 1
approaching, 1
Noirtier--"Here, 1
is, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"you, 1
requested, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him., 1
We, 1
have, 1
all, 1
wished, 1
for, 1
this, 1
interview,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
trust, 1
it, 1
will, 1
convince, 1
you, 1
how, 1
ill-formed, 1
are, 1
your, 1
objections, 1
to, 1
Valentine's, 1
marriage.", 1
Noirtier, 1
answered, 1
only, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
which, 1
made, 1
Villefort's, 1
blood, 1
run, 1
cold., 1
He, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
approach., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
her, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
conversing, 1
with, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
she, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
key., 1
Then, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
drawer, 1
of, 1
a, 1
small, 1
chest, 1
between, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
She, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
drawer,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
a, 1
key;, 1
and,, 1
understanding, 1
that, 1
was, 1
what, 1
he, 1
wanted,, 1
again, 1
watched, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
turned, 1
toward, 1
an, 1
old, 1
secretary, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
neglected, 1
for, 1
many, 1
years, 1
and, 1
was, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
contain, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1

called, 1

Villefort's, 1

casting, 1
a, 1

at, 1

of, 1

that, 1

carriage, 1

the, 1

told, 1
him, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1

through, 1

must, 1
be, 1

general.--"I, 1

run, 1
another, 1

the, 1
general,, 1
laughing,, 1
"that, 1
of, 1
being, 1
upset.", 1
We, 1
insert, 1
this, 1
joke, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
that, 1
the, 1
general, 1
was, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
the, 1
meeting,, 1

that, 1

came, 1
willingly., 1
When, 1
they, 1
were, 1
seated, 1
in, 1
the, 1

to, 1

made, 1

On, 1
the, 1
road, 1

the, 1
general, 1
make, 1
an, 1

to, 1
remove, 1

alley, 1
leading, 1
out, 1

of, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
of, 1
whose, 1
dignity, 1
he, 1

aware,, 1
considering, 1
him, 1
simply, 1
as, 1
a, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
club;, 1
they, 1
went, 1
through, 1
the, 1
alley,, 1
mounted, 1

flight, 1
of, 1
stairs,, 1

entered, 1

himself, 1
by, 1
saying,, 1

M., 1

paragraph, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1

return, 1
of, 1

were, 1

him, 1

a, 1

crouched, 1
in, 1

to, 1

the, 1
storm, 1
by, 1
supplicating, 1
glances, 1
at, 1

implacable, 1

upon, 1

Franz, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1

fixing, 1
a, 1
majestic, 1
look, 1
on, 1

Franz, 1
fell, 1
powerless, 1
on, 1

at, 1

Andrea, 1
at, 1

departure, 1
inherited, 1
all, 1
the, 1
papers, 1

proved, 1
that, 1

honor, 1
of, 1

son, 1

He, 1
was, 1
now, 1
fairly, 1
launched, 1
in, 1
that, 1
Parisian, 1
society, 1
which, 1
gives, 1
such, 1
ready, 1
access, 1
to, 1
foreigners,, 1
and, 1
treats, 1
them,, 1
not, 1
as, 1
they, 1
really, 1
are,, 1

as, 1
they, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
considered., 1

required, 1

to, 1

to, 1

are, 1
certainly, 1
less, 1
particular, 1
with, 1

than, 1
with, 1
a, 1
Frenchman., 1
Andrea, 1
had,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fortnight,, 1
attained, 1
a, 1
very, 1
fair, 1
position., 1

which, 1
now, 1

the, 1
state, 1

at, 1
the, 1
period, 1
we, 1
bring, 1
before, 1

evening, 1
to, 1

a, 1
visit., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
out,, 1

the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
asked, 1
to, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
accepted, 1
the, 1
invitation., 1
It, 1
was, 1
never, 1
without, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
shudder,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
dinner, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
events, 1
which, 1
followed, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
heard, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
name, 1
announced., 1
If, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come,, 1
the, 1
painful, 1
sensation, 1
became, 1
most, 1
intense;, 1
if,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
he, 1
appeared,, 1
his, 1
noble, 1
countenance,, 1
his, 1
brilliant, 1
eyes,, 1
his, 1
amiability,, 1
his, 1
polite, 1
attention, 1
even, 1
towards, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
soon, 1
dispelled, 1
every, 1
impression, 1
of, 1
fear., 1
It, 1
appeared, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
such, 1
delightfully, 1
pleasing, 1
manners, 1
should, 1
entertain, 1
evil, 1
designs, 1
against, 1
her;, 1
besides,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
corrupt, 1
minds, 1
only, 1
suspect, 1
evil, 1
when, 1
it, 1
would, 1
answer, 1
some, 1
interested, 1
end--useless, 1
injury, 1
is, 1
repugnant, 1
to, 1
every, 1
mind., 1
When, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
entered, 1

M., 1
Cavalcanti,--his, 1
presence, 1
soon, 1
produced, 1
its, 1
usual, 1
effect,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
with, 1
smiles, 1
that, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
received, 1
the, 1
count,, 1

she, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
little, 1
disconcerted, 1
at, 1
the, 1
announcement, 1
of, 1
his, 1
name., 1

latter, 1
took, 1
in, 1

at, 1
a, 1
glance., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
was, 1
partially, 1
reclining, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sofa,, 1
Eugenie, 1
sat, 1
near, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
was, 1
standing., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
like, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Goethe's, 1
heroes,, 1
with, 1
varnished, 1
shoes, 1
and, 1
white, 1
silk, 1
open-worked, 1
stockings,, 1
passed, 1
a, 1
white, 1
and, 1
tolerably, 1
nice-looking, 1
hand, 1
through, 1
his, 1
light, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
displayed, 1
a, 1
sparkling, 1
diamond,, 1
that, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
advice, 1
the, 1
vain, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
putting, 1
on, 1
his, 1
little, 1
finger., 1
This, 1
movement, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
killing, 1
glances, 1
at, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
sighs, 1
launched, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
direction., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
still, 1
the, 1
same--cold,, 1
beautiful,, 1
and, 1
satirical., 1
Not, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
glances,, 1
nor, 1
one, 1
sigh,, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
on, 1
her;, 1
they, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
said, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shield, 1
of, 1
Minerva,, 1
which, 1
some, 1
philosophers, 1
assert, 1
protected, 1
sometimes, 1
the, 1
breast, 1
of, 1
Sappho., 1
Eugenie, 1
bowed, 1
coldly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
availed, 1
herself, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
became, 1
earnest, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
to, 1
her, 1
study,, 1
whence, 1
very, 1
soon, 1
two, 1
cheerful, 1
and, 1
noisy, 1
voices, 1
being, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
connection, 1
with, 1
occasional, 1
notes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
piano, 1
assured, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
that, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
preferred, 1
to, 1
his, 1
society, 1
and, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
the, 1
company, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
her, 1
singing, 1
teacher., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then,, 1
especially, 1
while, 1
conversing, 1
with, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
apparently, 1
absorbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
charm, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
noticed, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti's, 1
solicitude,, 1
his, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
the, 1
music, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
he, 1
dared, 1
not, 1
pass,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
manifesting, 1
his, 1
admiration., 1
The, 1
banker, 1
soon, 1
returned., 1
His, 1
first, 1
look, 1
was, 1
certainly, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
second, 1
was, 1
for, 1
Andrea., 1
As, 1
for, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
as, 1
some, 1
husbands, 1
do, 1
to, 1
their, 1
wives,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
a, 1
way, 1
that, 1
bachelors, 1
will, 1
never, 1
comprehend,, 1
until, 1
a, 1
very, 1
extensive, 1
code, 1
is, 1
published, 1
on, 1
conjugal, 1
life., 1
"Have, 1
not, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
invited, 1
you, 1
to, 1
join, 1
them, 1
at, 1
the, 1
piano?", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
Andrea., 1
"Alas,, 1
no,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
still, 1
more, 1
remarkable, 1
than, 1
the, 1
former, 1
ones., 1
Danglars, 1
immediately, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
it., 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
ladies, 1
were, 1
seen, 1
seated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
chair,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
piano,, 1
accompanying, 1
themselves,, 1
each, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand,, 1
a, 1
fancy, 1
to, 1
which, 1
they, 1
had, 1
accustomed, 1
themselves,, 1
and, 1
performed, 1
admirably., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
then, 1
perceived, 1
through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
doorway,, 1
formed, 1
with, 1
Eugenie, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tableaux, 1
vivants, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Germans, 1
are, 1
so, 1
fond., 1
She, 1
was, 1
somewhat, 1
beautiful,, 1
and, 1
exquisitely, 1
formed--a, 1
little, 1
fairy-like, 1
figure,, 1
with, 1
large, 1
curls, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
her, 1
neck,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
too, 1
long,, 1
as, 1
Perugino, 1
sometimes, 1
makes, 1
his, 1
Virgins,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
dull, 1
from, 1
fatigue., 1
She, 1
was, 1
said, 1
to, 1
have, 1
a, 1
weak, 1
chest,, 1
and, 1
like, 1
Antonia, 1
in, 1
the, 1
"Cremona, 1
Violin,", 1
she, 1
would, 1
die, 1
one, 1
day, 1
while, 1
singing., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
cast, 1
one, 1
rapid, 1
and, 1
curious, 1
glance, 1
round, 1
this, 1
sanctum;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
much., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
to, 1
his, 1
daughter,, 1
"are, 1
we, 1
then, 1
all, 1
to, 1
be, 1
excluded?", 1
He, 1
then, 1
led, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
into, 1
the, 1
study,, 1
and, 1
either, 1
by, 1
chance, 1
or, 1
manoeuvre, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
partially, 1
closed, 1
after, 1
Andrea,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
from, 1
the, 1
place, 1
where, 1
they, 1
sat, 1
neither, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
nor, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
could, 1
see, 1
anything;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
had, 1
accompanied, 1
Andrea,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
take, 1
no, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
it., 1
The, 1
count, 1
soon, 1
heard, 1
Andrea's, 1
voice,, 1
singing, 1
a, 1
Corsican, 1
song,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
piano., 1
While, 1
the, 1
count, 1
smiled, 1
at, 1
hearing, 1
this, 1
song,, 1
which, 1
made, 1
him, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Andrea, 1
in, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
Benedetto,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
boasting, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
of, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
mind,, 1
who, 1
that, 1
very, 1
morning, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
by, 1
a, 1
failure, 1
at, 1
Milan., 1
The, 1
praise, 1
was, 1
well, 1
deserved,, 1
for, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
count, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
from, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
means, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
everything,, 1
the, 1
baron's, 1
countenance, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
led, 1
him, 1
to, 1
suspect, 1
it., 1
"Hem,", 1
thought, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"he, 1
begins, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
his, 1
losses;, 1
a, 1
month, 1
since, 1
he, 1
boasted, 1
of, 1
them.", 1
Then, 1
aloud,--"Oh,, 1
madame,, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
so, 1
skilful,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
regain, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Bourse, 1
what, 1
he, 1
loses, 1
elsewhere.", 1
"I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
you, 1
participate, 1
in, 1
a, 1
prevalent, 1
error,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"That, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
speculates,, 1
whereas, 1
he, 1
never, 1
does.", 1
"Truly,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
recollect, 1
M., 1
Debray, 1
told, 1
me--apropos,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
become, 1
of, 1
him?, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
him, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
days.", 1
"Nor, 1
I,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
began, 1
a, 1
sentence,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
finish.", 1
"Which?", 1
"M., 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
told, 1
you"--, 1
"Ah,, 1
yes;, 1
he, 1
told, 1
me, 1
it, 1
was, 1
you, 1
who, 1
sacrificed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
demon, 1
of, 1
speculation.", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
once, 1
very, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
indulge, 1
now.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
are, 1
wrong,, 1
madame., 1
Fortune, 1
is, 1
precarious;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
and, 1
fate, 1
had, 1
made, 1
me, 1
a, 1
banker's, 1
wife,, 1
whatever, 1
might, 1
be, 1
my, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
my, 1
husband's, 1
good, 1
fortune,, 1
still, 1
in, 1
speculation, 1
you, 1
know, 1
there, 1
is, 1
great, 1
risk., 1
Well,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
secure, 1
for, 1
myself, 1
a, 1
fortune, 1
independent, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
I, 1
acquired, 1
it, 1
by, 1
placing, 1
my, 1
interests, 1
in, 1
hands, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
blushed,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
her, 1
efforts., 1
"Stay,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
observed, 1
her, 1
confusion,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lucky, 1
hit, 1
that, 1
was, 1
made, 1
yesterday, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Neapolitan, 1
bonds.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
none--nor, 1
have, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
possessed, 1
any;, 1
but, 1
really, 1
we, 1
have, 1
talked, 1
long, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
money,, 1
count,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
like, 1
two, 1
stockbrokers;, 1
have, 1
you, 1
heard, 1
how, 1
fate, 1
is, 1
persecuting, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
Villeforts?", 1
"What, 1
has, 1
happened?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
simulating, 1
total, 1
ignorance., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
the, 1
Marquis, 1
of, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
died, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days, 1
after, 1
he, 1
had, 1
set, 1
out, 1
on, 1
his, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
marchioness, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days, 1
after, 1
her, 1
arrival?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
that;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
Claudius, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Hamlet,, 1
'it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
law, 1
of, 1
nature;, 1
their, 1
fathers, 1
died, 1
before, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
mourned, 1
their, 1
loss;, 1

will, 1
die, 1
before, 1
their, 1
children,, 1
who, 1
will,, 1
in, 1
their, 1
turn,, 1
grieve, 1
for, 1
them.'", 1
"But, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
all.", 1
"Not, 1
all!", 1
"No;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
their, 1
daughter"--, 1
"To, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
broken, 1
off?", 1
"Yesterday, 1
morning,, 1
it, 1
appears,, 1
Franz, 1
declined, 1
the, 1
honor.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
And, 1
is, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
known?", 1
"No.", 1
"How, 1
extraordinary!, 1
And, 1
how, 1
does, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
bear, 1
it?", 1
"As, 1
usual., 1
Like, 1
a, 1
philosopher.", 1
Danglars, 1
returned, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
alone., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
with, 1
your, 1
daughter?", 1
"And, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
consider, 1
her, 1
no, 1
one?", 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Prince, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
is, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
is, 1
he, 1
not?, 1

is, 1
he, 1
really, 1
a, 1
prince?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
answer, 1
for, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"His, 1
father, 1
was, 1
introduced, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
a, 1
marquis,, 1

he, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
count;, 1

I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
he, 1
has, 1
much, 1
claim, 1
to, 1
that, 1
title.", 1
"Why?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker., 1
"If, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
prince,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
wrong, 1
not, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
his, 1
rank;, 1

do, 1
not, 1

origin.", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
thorough, 1
democrat,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling., 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
see, 1
to, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
exposing, 1
yourself?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"If,, 1
perchance,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
came,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
find, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
in, 1
that, 1
room,, 1
where, 1
he,, 1
the, 1
betrothed, 1
of, 1
Eugenie,, 1
has, 1
never, 1
been, 1
admitted.", 1
"You, 1
may, 1
well, 1
say,, 1
perchance,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
banker;, 1
"for, 1
he, 1
comes, 1
so, 1
seldom,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
seem, 1
only, 1
chance, 1
that, 1
brings, 1
him.", 1
"But, 1
should, 1
he, 1
come, 1
and, 1
find, 1
that, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
your, 1
daughter,, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
displeased.", 1
"He?, 1
You, 1
are, 1
mistaken., 1
M., 1
Albert, 1
would, 1
not, 1
do, 1
us, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
to, 1
be, 1
jealous;, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
like, 1
Eugenie, 1
sufficiently., 1
Besides,, 1
I, 1
care, 1
not, 1
for, 1
his, 1
displeasure.", 1
"Still,, 1
situated, 1

"Yes,, 1

know, 1
how, 1
we, 1
are, 1
situated?, 1
At, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
ball, 1
he, 1
danced, 1
once, 1
with, 1
Eugenie,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
three, 1
times,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
took, 1
no, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
The, 1
valet, 1
announced, 1
the, 1
Vicomte, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
rose, 1
hastily,, 1

was, 1
going, 1
into, 1
the, 1
study,, 1
when, 1
Danglars, 1
stopped, 1
her., 1
"Let, 1
her, 1
alone,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
She, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
in, 1
amazement., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
unconscious, 1
of, 1
what, 1
passed., 1
Albert, 1
entered,, 1
looking, 1
very, 1
handsome, 1
and, 1
in, 1
high, 1
spirits., 1
He, 1
bowed, 1
politely, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
familiarly, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
affectionately, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness:, 1
"May, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
how, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
is?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"She, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
well,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars, 1
quickly;, 1
"she, 1
is, 1
at, 1
the, 1
piano, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
Albert, 1
retained, 1
his, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
indifferent, 1
manner;, 1
he, 1
might, 1
feel, 1
perhaps, 1
annoyed,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
on, 1
him., 1
"M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
has, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
tenor, 1
voice,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
soprano,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
she, 1
plays, 1
the, 1
piano, 1
like, 1
Thalberg., 1
The, 1
concert, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
one.", 1
"They, 1
suit, 1
each, 1
other, 1
remarkably, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
Albert, 1
appeared, 1
not, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
this, 1
remark,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
however,, 1
so, 1
rude, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
blushed., 1
"I,, 1
too,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"am, 1
a, 1
musician--at, 1
least,, 1
my, 1
masters, 1
used, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
so;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
strange, 1
that, 1
my, 1
voice, 1
never, 1
would, 1
suit, 1
any, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
soprano, 1
less, 1
than, 1
any.", 1
Danglars, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
of, 1
no, 1
consequence.", 1
Then,, 1
hoping, 1
doubtless, 1
to, 1
effect, 1
his, 1
purpose,, 1
he, 1
said,--"The, 1
prince, 1
and, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
were, 1
universally, 1
admired, 1
yesterday., 1
You, 1
were, 1
not, 1
of, 1
the, 1
party,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf?", 1
"What, 1
prince?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"Prince, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
persisted, 1
in, 1
giving, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
that, 1
title., 1
"Pardon, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
prince., 1
And, 1
Prince, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
sang, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
yesterday?, 1
It, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
charming,, 1
indeed., 1
I, 1
regret, 1
not, 1
having, 1
heard, 1
them., 1
But, 1
I, 1
was, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
accept, 1
your, 1
invitation,, 1
having, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
a, 1
German, 1
concert, 1
given, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Baroness, 1
of, 1
Chateau-Renaud.", 1
This, 1
was, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
rather, 1
an, 1
awkward, 1
silence., 1
"May, 1
I, 1
also, 1
be, 1
allowed,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"to, 1
pay, 1
my, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Wait, 1
a, 1
moment,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
stopping, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
that, 1
delightful, 1
cavatina?, 1
Ta,, 1
ta,, 1
ta,, 1
ti,, 1
ta,, 1
ti,, 1
ta,, 1
ta;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
charming,, 1
let, 1
them, 1
finish--one, 1
moment., 1
Bravo,, 1
bravi,, 1
brava!", 1
The, 1
banker, 1
was, 1
enthusiastic, 1
in, 1
his, 1
applause., 1
"Indeed,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
exquisite;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
music, 1
of, 1
his, 1
country, 1
better, 1
than, 1
Prince, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
does., 1
You, 1
said, 1
prince,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
But, 1
he, 1
can, 1
easily, 1
become, 1
one,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
already;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
uncommon, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
Italy., 1
But, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
charming, 1
musicians--you, 1
should, 1
give, 1
us, 1
a, 1
treat,, 1
Danglars,, 1
without, 1
telling, 1
them, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
stranger., 1
Ask, 1
them, 1
to, 1
sing, 1
one, 1
more, 1
song;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
so, 1
delightful, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
music, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distance,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
musicians, 1
are, 1
unrestrained, 1
by, 1
observation.", 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
annoyed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
indifference., 1
He, 1
took, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
aside., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
our, 1
lover?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"He, 1
appears, 1
cool., 1
But,, 1
then, 1
your, 1
word, 1
is, 1
given.", 1
"Yes,, 1
doubtless, 1
I, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
give, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
loves, 1
her,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
to, 1
one, 1
who, 1
does, 1
not., 1
See, 1
him, 1
there,, 1
cold, 1
as, 1
marble, 1
and, 1
proud, 1
like, 1
his, 1
father., 1
If, 1
he, 1
were, 1
rich,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
Cavalcanti's, 1
fortune,, 1
that, 1
might, 1
be, 1
pardoned., 1
Ma, 1
foi,, 1
I, 1
haven't, 1
consulted, 1
my, 1
daughter;, 1
but, 1
if, 1
she, 1
has, 1
good, 1
taste"--, 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"my, 1
fondness, 1
may, 1
blind, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
Morcerf, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
will, 1
render, 1
your, 1
daughter, 1
happy, 1
and, 1
will, 1
sooner, 1
or, 1
later, 1
attain, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
distinction,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
position, 1
is, 1
good.", 1
"Hem,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
doubt?", 1
"The, 1
past--that, 1
obscurity, 1
on, 1
the, 1
past.", 1
"But, 1
that, 1
does, 1
not, 1
affect, 1
the, 1
son.", 1
"Very, 1
true.", 1
"Now,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
don't, 1
go, 1
off, 1
your, 1
head., 1
It's, 1
a, 1
month, 1
now, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
must, 1
see, 1
that, 1
it, 1
throws, 1
some, 1
responsibility, 1
on, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house, 1
you, 1
met, 1
this, 1
young, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
really, 1
know, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
do.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
made, 1
inquiry?", 1
"Is, 1
there, 1
any, 1
need, 1
of, 1
that!, 1
Does, 1
not, 1
his, 1
appearance, 1
speak, 1
for, 1
him?, 1

he, 1
is, 1
very, 1
rich.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
so, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
that.", 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
said, 1
he, 1
had, 1
money.", 1
"Fifty, 1
thousand, 1
livres--a, 1
mere, 1
trifle.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
well, 1
educated.", 1
"Hem,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
a, 1
musician.", 1
"So, 1
are, 1
all, 1
Italians.", 1
"Come,, 1
count,, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
do, 1
that, 1
young, 1
man, 1
justice.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
acknowledge, 1
it, 1
annoys, 1
me,, 1
knowing, 1
your, 1
connection, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Morcerf, 1
family,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
way.", 1
Danglars, 1
burst, 1
out, 1
laughing., 1
"What, 1
a, 1
Puritan, 1
you, 1
are!", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"that, 1
happens, 1
every, 1
day.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
cannot, 1
break, 1
it, 1
off, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way;, 1
the, 1
Morcerfs, 1
are, 1
depending, 1
on, 1
this, 1
union.", 1
"Indeed.", 1
"Positively.", 1
"Then, 1
let, 1
them, 1
explain, 1
themselves;, 1
you, 1
should, 1
give, 1
the, 1
father, 1
a, 1
hint,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
so, 1
intimate, 1
with, 1
the, 1
family.", 1
"I?--where, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
did, 1
you, 1
find, 1
out, 1
that?", 1
"At, 1
their, 1
ball;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
apparent, 1
enough., 1
Why,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
the, 1
proud, 1
Mercedes,, 1
the, 1
disdainful, 1
Catalane,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
scarcely, 1
open, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
to, 1
her, 1
oldest, 1
acquaintances,, 1
take, 1
your, 1
arm,, 1
lead, 1
you, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
into, 1
the, 1
private, 1
walks,, 1
and, 1
remain, 1
there, 1
for, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour?", 1
"Ah,, 1
baron,, 1
baron,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
listening--what, 1
barbarism, 1
in, 1
a, 1
megalomaniac, 1
like, 1
you!", 1
"Oh,, 1
don't, 1
worry, 1
about, 1
me,, 1
Sir, 1
Mocker,", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
then, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"but, 1
will, 1
you, 1
undertake, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
the, 1
father?", 1
"Willingly,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
it.", 1
"But, 1
let, 1
it, 1
be, 1
done, 1
explicitly, 1
and, 1
positively., 1
If, 1
he, 1
demands, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
let, 1
him, 1
fix, 1
the, 1
day--declare, 1
his, 1
conditions;, 1
in, 1
short,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
either, 1
understand, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
or, 1
quarrel., 1
You, 1
understand--no, 1
more, 1
delay.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
my, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1
subject.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
await, 1
with, 1
pleasure, 1
his, 1
decision,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
do, 1
await, 1
it., 1
A, 1
banker, 1
must,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
be, 1
a, 1
slave, 1
to, 1
his, 1
promise.", 1
And, 1
Danglars, 1
sighed, 1
as, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
had, 1
done, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
before., 1
"Bravi,, 1
bravo,, 1
brava!", 1
cried, 1
Morcerf,, 1
parodying, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
selection, 1
came, 1
to, 1
an, 1
end., 1
Danglars, 1
began, 1
to, 1
look, 1
suspiciously, 1
at, 1
Morcerf,, 1
when, 1
some, 1
one, 1
came, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
soon, 1
return,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"wait, 1
for, 1
me., 1
I, 1
shall,, 1
perhaps,, 1
have, 1
something, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
took, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
absence, 1
to, 1
push, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
her, 1
daughter's, 1
study,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
before, 1
the, 1
piano, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie,, 1
started, 1
up, 1
like, 1
a, 1
jack-in-the-box., 1
Albert, 1
bowed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
disturbed,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
his, 1
bow, 1
with, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
coolness., 1
Cavalcanti, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
embarrassed;, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
replied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
impertinent, 1
look, 1
possible., 1
Then, 1
Albert, 1
launched, 1
out, 1
in, 1
praise, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars', 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
his, 1
regret,, 1
after, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
heard,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
be, 1
present, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
being, 1
left, 1
alone,, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
"leave, 1
music, 1
and, 1
compliments,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
and, 1
take, 1
tea.", 1
"Come,, 1
Louise,", 1
said, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
her, 1
friend., 1
They, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
next, 1
drawing-room,, 1
where, 1
tea, 1
was, 1
prepared., 1
Just, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
beginning,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
English, 1
fashion,, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
spoons, 1
in, 1
their, 1
cups,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
again, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
Danglars, 1
entered,, 1
visibly, 1
agitated., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
observed, 1
it, 1
particularly,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
asked, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
for, 1
an, 1
explanation., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
received, 1
my, 1
courier, 1
from, 1
Greece,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
your, 1
running, 1
away, 1
from, 1
us.", 1
"Yes.", 1
"How, 1
is, 1
King, 1
Otho, 1
getting, 1
on?", 1
asked, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
sprightly, 1
tone., 1
Danglars, 1
cast, 1
another, 1
suspicious, 1
look, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
without, 1
answering,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
pity, 1
which, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
features,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
was, 1
gone, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"We, 1
shall, 1
go, 1
together,, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
not?", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"If, 1
you, 1
like,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
latter., 1
Albert, 1
could, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
look,, 1

in, 1
his, 1

did;, 1

he, 1
mean, 1
by, 1
his, 1
news, 1
from, 1
Greece?", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you?", 1

you, 1
have, 1
correspondents, 1

stooping, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
ear,, 1
"Your, 1
advice, 1
was, 1
excellent,", 1

prudence, 1

than, 1
Albert,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
the, 1

burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
laughter--much, 1
too, 1
loud, 1
in, 1
fact, 1
not, 1
to, 1
give, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
its, 1
being, 1
rather, 1
forced, 1
and, 1
unnatural., 1
"Well,", 1

he,, 1
"I, 1

remained, 1
rooted, 1

spot,, 1

could, 1
form, 1
no, 1
adequate, 1
idea., 1
"Whom, 1
do, 1

young, 1
girl, 1
in, 1
Romaic,, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1

language., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
his, 1
name?", 1
"Count, 1
Albert;, 1

Cristo, 1
reflected, 1
one, 1
instant., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
speak, 1
in, 1
Italian,", 1

he., 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Albert,--"It, 1

to, 1
Haidee, 1
to, 1

excellent, 1
Tuscan,, 1

with, 1
that, 1
soft, 1
Roman, 1

makes, 1
the, 1
language, 1
of, 1
Dante, 1
as, 1
sonorous, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1

Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1

directed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
bring, 1
coffee, 1

entered, 1

coffee, 1

chibouques;, 1
as, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Baptistin,, 1
this, 1
portion, 1

refused, 1
the, 1
pipe, 1

him., 1
"Oh,, 1

it--take, 1
it,", 1

Ali, 1
left, 1
the, 1

cups, 1
of, 1
coffee, 1
were, 1

prepared,, 1
with, 1

of, 1

had, 1
been, 1
brought, 1
for, 1

Haidee, 1
took, 1
the, 1
beverage, 1
in, 1
the, 1
original, 1
Arabian, 1
manner,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
without, 1
sugar., 1
Haidee, 1
took, 1
the, 1
porcelain, 1
cup, 1
in, 1
her, 1
little, 1
slender, 1
fingers, 1
and, 1
conveyed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
her, 1
mouth, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
innocent, 1
artlessness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
child, 1
when, 1
eating, 1
or, 1
drinking, 1
something, 1
which, 1
it, 1
likes., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
two, 1
women, 1
entered,, 1
bringing, 1
salvers, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
ices, 1
and, 1
sherbet,, 1
which, 1
they, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
two, 1
small, 1
tables, 1
appropriated, 1
to, 1
that, 1
purpose., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
host,, 1

you,, 1

Albert,, 1
in, 1
Italian,, 1
"excuse, 1
my, 1
apparent, 1
stupidity., 1
I, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
bewildered,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
natural, 1
that, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
so., 1
Here, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1

a, 1
moment, 1

of, 1

the, 1
tinkling, 1
of, 1
the, 1

Greek,, 1
your, 1

to, 1
the, 1
fairy-scene, 1

surrounds, 1

quietly;, 1

Albert, 1

towards, 1
Haidee., 1
"At, 1
what, 1
age, 1
did, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
Greece,, 1
signora?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
left, 1
it, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1

five, 1
years, 1

Haidee., 1

have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
recollection, 1
of, 1
your, 1
country?", 1

I, 1
shut, 1
my, 1

"And, 1
how, 1
far, 1
back, 1
into, 1
the, 1
past, 1
do, 1
your, 1
recollections, 1
extend?", 1
"I, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
walk, 1
when, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
called, 1
Vasiliki,, 1
which, 1
means, 1
royal,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
tossing, 1
her, 1
head, 1
proudly,, 1
"took, 1
me, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1

in, 1
our, 1

all, 1
the, 1
money, 1
we, 1
possessed,, 1
we, 1
went, 1
out,, 1

turned, 1
to, 1
Haidee,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
countenance, 1

to, 1

Haidee, 1
sighed, 1
deeply,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
sadness, 1
clouded, 1
her, 1
beautiful, 1
brow., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1

said, 1
Morcerf, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone., 1
"I, 1
again, 1

her, 1

that, 1
she, 1

"Then,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"this, 1
pious, 1
pilgrimage, 1
in, 1

of, 1

first, 1
remembrance;, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
next?", 1
"Oh,, 1

under, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
some, 1
sycamore-trees,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
borders, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lake,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
waters, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
trembling, 1
foliage, 1
was, 1
reflected, 1
as, 1
in, 1
a, 1
mirror., 1
Under, 1
the, 1
oldest, 1
and, 1
thickest, 1
of, 1
these, 1
trees,, 1
reclining, 1
on, 1
cushions,, 1

my, 1

was, 1
at, 1
his, 1
feet,, 1

I,, 1
childlike,, 1
amused, 1
myself, 1
by, 1
playing, 1
with, 1

long, 1
white, 1
beard, 1

descended, 1

of, 1

Then, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
there, 1
came, 1
to, 1
him, 1
an, 1
Albanian, 1
who, 1
said, 1
something, 1
to, 1
which, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
attention,, 1

which, 1
he, 1
always, 1
answered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
voice,, 1
either, 1
'Kill,', 1
or, 1
'Pardon.'", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
very, 1
strange,", 1

Albert,, 1
"to, 1

enchanted, 1
scenes?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
country,", 1
said, 1
Haidee,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
see, 1
France, 1

joyous.", 1
"So, 1
young,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
forgetting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
Count's, 1
command, 1
that, 1

should, 1
ask, 1
no, 1

of, 1

slave, 1
herself,, 1

Haidee, 1
turned, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
towards, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
who,, 1
making, 1
at, 1
the, 1

time, 1
some, 1
imperceptible, 1
sign,, 1
murmured,--"Go, 1

"Nothing, 1

"Speak,, 1
speak,, 1

Albert,, 1
"I, 1

his, 1
remark, 1
with, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
smile., 1
"You, 1

she., 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
you, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
but, 1
four, 1
years, 1
old, 1
when, 1
one, 1
night, 1
I, 1
was, 1
suddenly, 1
awakened, 1
by, 1
my, 1
mother., 1
We, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
palace, 1
of, 1
Yanina;, 1
she, 1
snatched, 1
me, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cushions, 1
on, 1
which, 1
I, 1
was, 1
sleeping,, 1

on, 1

took, 1
me, 1
away, 1
without, 1
speaking., 1
When, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
weeping, 1
I, 1
began, 1
to, 1
cry, 1
too., 1
'Hush,, 1

said, 1
she., 1
At, 1
other, 1
times, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
maternal, 1
endearments, 1

threats,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
with, 1
a, 1
child's, 1
caprice, 1

my, 1
feelings, 1
of, 1
sorrow, 1

anger, 1
by, 1
crying, 1

much, 1
as, 1
I, 1
felt, 1
inclined;, 1
but, 1
on, 1
this, 1
occasion, 1
there, 1
was, 1
an, 1
intonation, 1
of, 1
such, 1
extreme, 1
terror, 1
in, 1
my, 1
mother's, 1
voice, 1
when, 1
she, 1
enjoined, 1
me, 1
to, 1
silence,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
ceased, 1
crying, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
her, 1
command, 1
was, 1
given., 1
She, 1

then, 1
that, 1
we, 1
were, 1

a, 1
large, 1

around, 1
us, 1

may, 1
imagine, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
startling, 1

ominous,", 1

Haidee,, 1
shaking, 1
her, 1
head, 1
and, 1
turning, 1
pale, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mere, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scene,, 1

a, 1
voice, 1
at, 1

voice, 1

words, 1
pronounced, 1
with, 1
such, 1
a, 1
haughty, 1
and, 1
dignified, 1
accent;, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
him, 1
as, 1
if, 1
there, 1
was, 1
something, 1
supernaturally, 1
gloomy, 1
and, 1
terrible, 1
in, 1
the, 1

which, 1
gleamed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
brilliant, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Haidee, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment;, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
a, 1
Pythoness, 1
evoking, 1
a, 1
spectre,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
recalled, 1
to, 1
his, 1

listened, 1
with, 1
horror., 1
"Soon,", 1
said, 1
Haidee,, 1
"we, 1
halted, 1
on, 1
our, 1
march,, 1

found, 1
ourselves, 1
on, 1
the, 1
borders, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lake., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
pressed, 1
me, 1
to, 1
her, 1
throbbing, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
few, 1
paces, 1

was, 1
glancing, 1
anxiously, 1
around., 1
Four, 1
marble, 1
steps, 1
led, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
water's, 1
edge,, 1
and, 1
below, 1
them, 1
was, 1
a, 1
boat, 1
floating, 1
on, 1
the, 1
tide., 1
"From, 1
where, 1
we, 1
stood, 1
I, 1
could, 1
see, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lake, 1
a, 1
large, 1
blank, 1
mass;, 1
it, 1
was, 1

we, 1
were, 1
going., 1
This, 1
kiosk, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
at, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
distance,, 1
perhaps, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night,, 1
which, 1
prevented, 1
any, 1
object, 1
from, 1
being, 1
more, 1
than, 1
partially, 1
discerned., 1
We, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
boat., 1
I, 1
remember, 1
well, 1
that, 1
the, 1
oars, 1
made, 1
no, 1
noise, 1
whatever, 1
in, 1
striking, 1
the, 1
water,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
leaned, 1
over, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
muffled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sashes, 1
of, 1
our, 1
Palikares., 1
[*], 1
Besides, 1
the, 1
rowers,, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
contained, 1
only, 1
the, 1
women,, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
mother,, 1
Selim,, 1
and, 1
myself., 1
The, 1
Palikares, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shore, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lake,, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
cover, 1
our, 1
retreat;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
kneeling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lowest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marble, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
that, 1
manner, 1
intended, 1
making, 1
a, 1
rampart, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
others,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
pursuit., 1
Our, 1
bark, 1
flew, 1
before, 1
the, 1
wind., 1
'Why, 1
does, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
go, 1
so, 1
fast?', 1
asked, 1

"'Silence,, 1

I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
understand., 1
Why, 1
should, 1
my, 1
father, 1
fly?--he,, 1
the, 1
all-powerful--he,, 1
before, 1
whom, 1
others, 1
were, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1

who, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
his, 1
device,, 1
'They, 1
hate, 1
me;, 1
then, 1
they, 1
fear, 1
me!', 1
It, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
flight, 1
which, 1
my, 1
father, 1
was, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
effect., 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
told, 1
since, 1
that, 1

Here, 1
Haidee, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
significant, 1
glance, 1
at, 1

eyes, 1
had, 1
been, 1
riveted, 1
on, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
course, 1
of, 1
her, 1
narrative., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
then, 1
continued,, 1
speaking, 1
slowly,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
person, 1
who, 1
is, 1
either, 1
inventing, 1
or, 1
suppressing, 1
some, 1
feature, 1
of, 1

he, 1
is, 1
relating., 1
"You, 1
were, 1
saying,, 1

said, 1
Albert,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
paying, 1
the, 1
most, 1
implicit, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1
recital,, 1

asked, 1
Albert,, 1
"do, 1

exchanged, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
with, 1
the, 1
young, 1

was, 1
quite, 1
unperceived, 1

of, 1

played, 1

pardon, 1

complete,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
return, 1
triumphant, 1
to, 1
Yanina;, 1
if, 1
the, 1
news, 1
be, 1
inauspicious,, 1

must, 1
fly, 1
this, 1
night.'--'But, 1
supposing, 1
our, 1
enemy, 1
should, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
us, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so?', 1
said, 1
my, 1
mother., 1
'Oh,, 1
make, 1
yourself, 1
easy, 1
on, 1
that, 1
head,', 1
said, 1
Ali,, 1
smiling;, 1
'Selim, 1
and, 1
his, 1
flaming, 1
lance, 1
will, 1
settle, 1
that, 1

They, 1
would, 1
be, 1
glad, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me, 1
dead,, 1

they, 1
would, 1
not, 1

themselves, 1
to, 1
die, 1
with, 1
me.', 1
"My, 1
mother, 1
only, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
sighs, 1
to, 1
consolations, 1
which, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
from, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
heart., 1
She, 1
prepared, 1
the, 1
iced, 1
water, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
constantly, 1
drinking,--for, 1
since, 1
his, 1
sojourn, 1
at, 1
the, 1
kiosk, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
parched, 1
by, 1
the, 1
most, 1
violent, 1
fever,--after, 1
which, 1
she, 1
anointed, 1
his, 1
white, 1
beard, 1
with, 1
perfumed, 1
oil,, 1
and, 1
lighted, 1
his, 1
chibouque,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
sometimes, 1
smoked, 1
for, 1
hours, 1
together,, 1
quietly, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
wreaths, 1
of, 1
vapor, 1
that, 1
ascended, 1
in, 1
spiral, 1
clouds, 1
and, 1
gradually, 1
melted, 1
away, 1
in, 1
the, 1
surrounding, 1
atmosphere., 1
Presently, 1
he, 1
made, 1
such, 1
a, 1
sudden, 1
movement, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
paralyzed, 1
with, 1
fear., 1
Then,, 1
without, 1
taking, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
from, 1
the, 1
object, 1
which, 1
had, 1
first, 1
attracted, 1
his, 1
attention,, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
his, 1
telescope., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
she, 1
did, 1
so,, 1
looked, 1
whiter, 1
than, 1
the, 1
marble, 1
against, 1
which, 1
she, 1
leaned., 1
I, 1
saw, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
hand, 1
tremble., 1
'A, 1
boat!--two!--three!', 1
murmured, 1
my,, 1
father;--'four!', 1
He, 1
then, 1
arose,, 1
seizing, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
priming, 1
his, 1
pistols., 1
'Vasiliki,', 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
trembling, 1
perceptibly,, 1
'the, 1
instant, 1
approaches, 1
which, 1
will, 1
decide, 1
everything., 1
In, 1
the, 1
space, 1
of, 1
half, 1

will, 1
not, 1

you,', 1
said, 1
Vasiliki;, 1
'if, 1
you, 1

my, 1
lord,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
die, 1
with, 1
you.'--'Go, 1
to, 1
Selim!', 1
cried, 1
my, 1
father., 1
'Adieu,, 1
my, 1
lord,', 1
murmured, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
determining, 1
quietly, 1
to, 1
await, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
death., 1
'Take, 1
away, 1
Vasiliki!', 1
said, 1
my, 1
father, 1
to, 1
his, 1
Palikares., 1
"As, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
forgotten, 1
in, 1
the, 1
general, 1
confusion;, 1
I, 1
ran, 1
toward, 1
Ali, 1
Tepelini;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
me, 1
hold, 1
out, 1
my, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
stooped, 1
down, 1
and, 1
pressed, 1
my, 1
forehead, 1
with, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
Oh,, 1
how, 1
distinctly, 1
I, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
kiss!--it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
last, 1
he, 1
ever, 1
gave, 1
me,, 1

I, 1
feel, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
still, 1
warm, 1
on, 1
my, 1
forehead., 1
On, 1
descending,, 1
we, 1
saw, 1
through, 1
the, 1
lattice-work, 1
several, 1
boats, 1
which, 1
were, 1
gradually, 1
becoming, 1
more, 1
distinct, 1
to, 1
our, 1
view., 1
At, 1
first, 1
they, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
black, 1
specks,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
they, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
birds, 1
skimming, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
kiosk, 1
at, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
feet,, 1
were, 1
seated, 1
twenty, 1
Palikares,, 1
concealed, 1
from, 1
view, 1
by, 1
an, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
and, 1
watching, 1
with, 1
eager, 1
eyes, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boats., 1
They, 1
were, 1
armed, 1
with, 1
their, 1
long, 1
guns, 1
inlaid, 1
with, 1
mother-of-pearl, 1
and, 1
silver,, 1
and, 1
cartridges, 1
in, 1
great, 1
numbers, 1
were, 1
lying, 1
scattered, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
My, 1
father, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
and, 1
paced, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
with, 1
a, 1
countenance, 1
expressive, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
anguish., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
which, 1
presented, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
my, 1
view, 1
as, 1
I, 1
quitted, 1
my, 1
father, 1
after, 1
that, 1
last, 1
kiss., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
and, 1
I, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
passage, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cavern., 1
Selim, 1
was, 1
still, 1
at, 1
his, 1
post,, 1
and, 1
smiled, 1
sadly, 1
on, 1
us, 1
as, 1
we, 1
entered., 1
We, 1
fetched, 1
our, 1
cushions, 1
from, 1
the, 1
other, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cavern,, 1
and, 1
sat, 1
down, 1

ones, 1

to, 1

was,, 1

quite, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
some, 1
imminent, 1
danger, 1
was, 1
hanging, 1
over, 1
our, 1
heads.", 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
often, 1
heard--not, 1
from, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
never, 1
spoke, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1

from, 1
strangers--the, 1
description, 1
of, 1
the, 1
last, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
vizier, 1
of, 1
Yanina;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
read, 1
different, 1
accounts, 1
of, 1
his, 1
death,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
story, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
acquire, 1
fresh, 1
meaning, 1
from, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
sympathetic, 1
accent, 1
and, 1
the, 1
melancholy, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
at, 1
once, 1
charmed, 1
and, 1
horrified, 1
him., 1
As, 1
to, 1
Haidee,, 1
these, 1
terrible, 1
reminiscences, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
overpowered, 1
her, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
for, 1
she, 1
ceased, 1
speaking,, 1
her, 1
head, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
like, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
flower, 1
bowing, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
violence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
storm;, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
gazing, 1
on, 1
vacancy, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
mentally, 1
contemplating, 1
the, 1
green, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pindus, 1
and, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
waters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lake, 1
of, 1
Yanina,, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
magic, 1
mirror,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
the, 1
sombre, 1
picture, 1
which, 1
she, 1
sketched., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
an, 1
indescribable, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
interest, 1
and, 1
pity., 1
"Go, 1
on,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Romaic, 1
language., 1
Haidee, 1
looked, 1
up, 1
abruptly,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
sonorous, 1
tones, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
voice, 1
had, 1
awakened, 1
her, 1
from, 1
a, 1
dream;, 1
and, 1
she, 1
resumed, 1
her, 1
narrative., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
about, 1
four, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
afternoon,, 1
and, 1
although, 1
the, 1
day, 1
was, 1
brilliant, 1
out-of-doors,, 1
we, 1
were, 1
enveloped, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
darkness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cavern., 1
One, 1
single,, 1
solitary, 1
light, 1
was, 1
burning, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
a, 1
star, 1
set, 1
in, 1
a, 1
heaven, 1
of, 1
blackness;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Selim's, 1
flaming, 1
lance., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Christian,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
prayed., 1
Selim, 1
repeated, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time, 1
the, 1
sacred, 1
words:, 1
'God, 1
is, 1
great!', 1
However,, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
had, 1
still, 1
some, 1
hope., 1
As, 1
she, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
down,, 1
she, 1
thought, 1
she, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
French, 1
officer, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
Constantinople,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
whom, 1
my, 1
father, 1
placed, 1
so, 1
much, 1
confidence;, 1
for, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
soldiers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
French, 1
emperor, 1
were, 1
naturally, 1
noble, 1
and, 1
generous., 1
She, 1
advanced, 1
some, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
listened., 1
'They, 1
are, 1
approaching,', 1
said, 1
she;, 1
'perhaps, 1
they, 1
bring, 1
us, 1
peace, 1
and, 1
liberty!'--'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
fear,, 1
Vasiliki?', 1
said, 1
Selim,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
at, 1
once, 1
so, 1
gentle, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
so, 1
proud., 1
'If, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
us, 1
peace,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
give, 1
them, 1
war;, 1
if, 1
they, 1
do, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
life,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
give, 1
them, 1
death.', 1
And, 1
he, 1
renewed, 1
the, 1
flame, 1
of, 1
his, 1
lance, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
which, 1
made, 1
one, 1
think, 1
of, 1
Dionysus, 1
of, 1
Crete., 1
[*], 1
But, 1
I,, 1
being, 1
only, 1
a, 1
little, 1
child,, 1
was, 1
terrified, 1
by, 1
this, 1
undaunted, 1
courage,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
me, 1
both, 1
ferocious, 1
and, 1
senseless,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
recoiled, 1
with, 1
horror, 1
from, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
the, 1
frightful, 1
death, 1
amidst, 1
fire, 1

awaited, 1
us., 1

to, 1

is, 1
to, 1
the, 1
behavior, 1
of, 1
an, 1
actor, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Dionysian, 1
festivals.--Ed., 1
"My, 1
mother, 1
experienced, 1
the, 1

felt, 1
her, 1

'Mamma,, 1
mamma,', 1
said, 1
I,, 1
'are, 1

And, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
my, 1
voice, 1
the, 1
slaves, 1
redoubled, 1
their, 1
cries, 1
and, 1
prayers, 1
and, 1
lamentations., 1
'My, 1

said, 1
Vasiliki,, 1
'may, 1

to-day, 1
you, 1

Then,, 1
whispering, 1
to, 1
Selim,, 1
she, 1
asked, 1
what, 1
were, 1
her, 1

orders., 1
'If, 1

said, 1
my, 1

'when, 1

replied, 1
Selim, 1
tranquilly., 1
"Suddenly, 1
we, 1
heard, 1
loud, 1
cries;, 1
and,, 1
listening,, 1
discerned, 1
that, 1

it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1

brought, 1
the, 1
answer, 1
of, 1

that, 1

"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
remember, 1

said, 1
Morcerf,, 1

ready, 1
to, 1

of, 1
the, 1
cave,, 1
formed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
few, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
daylight, 1
which, 1
had, 1
found, 1
their, 1
way, 1
into, 1
this, 1
gloomy, 1
retreat., 1
'Who, 1
are, 1
you?', 1
cried, 1
Selim., 1
'But, 1
whoever, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be,, 1
I, 1
charge, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
advance, 1
another, 1
step.'--'Long, 1
live, 1
the, 1
emperor!', 1
said, 1
the, 1
figure., 1
'He, 1
grants, 1
a, 1
full, 1
pardon, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Vizier, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
only, 1
gives, 1
him, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
but, 1
restores, 1
to, 1
him, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
and, 1
his, 1
possessions.', 1
My, 1
mother, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy,, 1
and, 1
clasped, 1
me, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bosom., 1
'Stop,', 1
said, 1
Selim,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
go, 1
out;, 1
'you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
received, 1
the, 1
ring,'--'True,', 1
said, 1
my, 1
mother., 1
And, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
her, 1
knees,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
holding, 1
me, 1
up, 1
towards, 1
heaven,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
she, 1
desired,, 1
while, 1
praying, 1
to, 1
God, 1
in, 1
my, 1
behalf,, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
me, 1
actually, 1
to, 1
his, 1
presence.", 1
And, 1
for, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
Haidee, 1
stopped,, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
such, 1
violent, 1
emotion, 1
that, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
stood, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
pale, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
stifled, 1
voice, 1
seemed, 1
hardly, 1
able, 1
to, 1
find, 1
utterance,, 1
so, 1
parched, 1
and, 1
dry, 1
were, 1
her, 1
throat, 1
and, 1
lips., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
poured, 1
a, 1
little, 1
iced, 1
water, 1
into, 1
a, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
it, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
saying, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mildness, 1
in, 1
which, 1
was, 1
also, 1
a, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
command,--"Courage.", 1
Haidee, 1
dried, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
continued:, 1
"By, 1
this, 1
time, 1
our, 1
eyes,, 1
habituated, 1
to, 1
the, 1
darkness,, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
messenger, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pasha,--it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
friend., 1
Selim, 1
had, 1
also, 1
recognized, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
brave, 1
young, 1
man, 1
only, 1
acknowledged, 1
one, 1
duty,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
obey., 1
'In, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
do, 1
you, 1
come?', 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
him., 1
'I, 1
come, 1
in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
our, 1
master,, 1
Ali, 1
Tepelini.'--'If, 1
you, 1
come, 1
from, 1
Ali, 1
himself,', 1
said, 1
Selim,, 1
'you, 1
know, 1
what, 1
you, 1
were, 1
charged, 1
to, 1
remit, 1
to, 1
me?'--'Yes,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
messenger,, 1
'and, 1
I, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
his, 1
ring.', 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
above, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
to, 1
show, 1
the, 1
token;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
too, 1
far, 1
off,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
was, 1
not, 1
light, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
enable, 1
Selim,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
standing,, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
and, 1
recognize, 1
the, 1
object, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
his, 1
view., 1
'I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
see, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hand,', 1
said, 1
Selim., 1
'Approach, 1
then,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
messenger,, 1
'or, 1
I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
prefer, 1
it.'--'I, 1
will, 1
agree, 1
to, 1
neither, 1
one, 1
nor, 1
the, 1
other,', 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
soldier;, 1
'place, 1
the, 1
object, 1
which, 1
I, 1
desire, 1
to, 1
see, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
which, 1
shines, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
retire, 1
while, 1
I, 1
examine, 1
it.'--'Be, 1
it, 1
so,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
envoy;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
retired,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
first, 1
deposited, 1
the, 1
token, 1
agreed, 1
on, 1
in, 1
the, 1
place, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
to, 1
him, 1
by, 1
Selim., 1
"Oh,, 1
how, 1
our, 1
hearts, 1
palpitated;, 1
for, 1
it, 1
did,, 1
indeed,, 1
seem, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
ring, 1
which, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
there., 1
But, 1
was, 1
it, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
ring?, 1
that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
question., 1
Selim,, 1
still, 1
holding, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
lighted, 1
match,, 1
walked, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
cavern,, 1
and,, 1
aided, 1
by, 1
the, 1
faint, 1
light, 1
which, 1
streamed, 1
in, 1
through, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cave,, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
the, 1
token., 1
"'It, 1
is, 1
well,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
kissing, 1
it;, 1
'it, 1
is, 1
my, 1
master's, 1
ring!', 1
And, 1
throwing, 1
the, 1
match, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
he, 1
trampled, 1
on, 1
it, 1
and, 1
extinguished, 1
it., 1
The, 1
messenger, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
clapped, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
At, 1
this, 1
signal, 1
four, 1
soldiers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Serasker, 1
Koorshid, 1
suddenly, 1
appeared,, 1
and, 1
Selim, 1
fell,, 1
pierced, 1
by, 1
five, 1
blows., 1
Each, 1
man, 1
had, 1
stabbed, 1
him, 1
separately,, 1
and,, 1
intoxicated, 1
by, 1
their, 1
crime,, 1
though, 1
still, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
fear,, 1
they, 1
sought, 1
all, 1
over, 1
the, 1
cavern, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
if, 1
there, 1
was, 1
any, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
fire,, 1
after, 1
which, 1
they, 1
amused, 1
themselves, 1
by, 1
rolling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bags, 1
of, 1
gold., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
seized, 1
me, 1
in, 1
her, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
hurrying, 1
noiselessly, 1
along, 1
numerous, 1
turnings, 1
and, 1
windings, 1
known, 1
only, 1
to, 1
ourselves,, 1
she, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
a, 1
private, 1
staircase, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kiosk,, 1
where, 1
was, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
frightful, 1
tumult, 1
and, 1
confusion., 1
The, 1
lower, 1
rooms, 1
were, 1
entirely, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
Koorshid's, 1
troops;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
with, 1
our, 1
enemies., 1
Just, 1
as, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
pushing, 1
open, 1
a, 1
small, 1
door,, 1
we, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pasha, 1
sounding, 1
in, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
and, 1
threatening, 1
tone., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
applied, 1
her, 1
eye, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crack, 1
between, 1
the, 1
boards;, 1
I, 1
luckily, 1
found, 1
a, 1
small, 1
opening, 1
which, 1
afforded, 1
me, 1
a, 1
view, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
and, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
within., 1
'What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?', 1
said, 1
my, 1
father, 1
to, 1
some, 1
people, 1
who, 1
were, 1
holding, 1
a, 1
paper, 1
inscribed, 1
with, 1
characters, 1
of, 1
gold., 1
'What, 1
we, 1
want,', 1
replied, 1
one,, 1
'is, 1
to, 1
communicate, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
will, 1
of, 1
his, 1
highness., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
see, 1
this, 1
firman?'--'I, 1
do,', 1
said, 1
my, 1
father., 1
'Well,, 1
read, 1
it;, 1
he, 1
demands, 1
your, 1
head.', 1
"My, 1
father, 1
answered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
laugh,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
more, 1
frightful, 1
than, 1
even, 1
threats, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
ceased, 1
when, 1
two, 1
reports, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
were, 1
heard;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
fired, 1
them, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
killed, 1
two, 1
men., 1
The, 1
Palikares,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
prostrated, 1
at, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
feet,, 1
now, 1
sprang, 1
up, 1
and, 1
fired,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
fire, 1
and, 1
smoke., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
firing, 1
began, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
balls, 1
penetrated, 1
the, 1
boards, 1
all, 1
round, 1
us., 1
Oh,, 1
how, 1
noble, 1
did, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
vizier, 1
my, 1
father, 1
look, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
flying, 1
bullets,, 1
his, 1
scimitar, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
face, 1
blackened, 1
with, 1
the, 1
powder, 1
of, 1
his, 1
enemies!, 1
and, 1
how, 1
he, 1
terrified, 1
them,, 1
even, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
them, 1
fly, 1
before, 1
him!, 1
'Selim,, 1
Selim!', 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
'guardian, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
do, 1
your, 1
duty!'--'Selim, 1
is, 1
dead,', 1
replied, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
come, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
the, 1
earth,, 1
'and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
lost,, 1
Ali!', 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
an, 1
explosion, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
flooring, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
my, 1
father, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
was, 1
suddenly, 1
torn, 1
up, 1
and, 1
shivered, 1
to, 1
atoms--the, 1
troops, 1
were, 1
firing, 1
from, 1
underneath., 1
Three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
Palikares, 1
fell, 1
with, 1
their, 1
bodies, 1
literally, 1
ploughed, 1
with, 1
wounds., 1
"My, 1
father, 1
howled, 1
aloud,, 1
plunged, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
into, 1
the, 1
holes, 1
which, 1
the, 1
balls, 1
had, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
tore, 1
up, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
planks, 1
entire., 1
But, 1
immediately, 1
through, 1
this, 1
opening, 1
twenty, 1
more, 1
shots, 1
were, 1
fired,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
flame,, 1
rushing, 1
up, 1
like, 1
fire, 1
from, 1
the, 1
crater, 1
of, 1
a, 1
volcano,, 1
soon, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
tapestry,, 1
which, 1
it, 1
quickly, 1
devoured., 1
In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
frightful, 1
tumult, 1
and, 1
these, 1
terrific, 1
cries,, 1
two, 1
reports,, 1
fearfully, 1
distinct,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
two, 1
shrieks, 1
more, 1
heartrending, 1
than, 1
all,, 1
froze, 1
me, 1
with, 1
terror., 1
These, 1
two, 1
shots, 1
had, 1
mortally, 1
wounded, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
had, 1
given, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
these, 1
frightful, 1
cries., 1
However,, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
standing,, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
a, 1
window., 1
My, 1
mother, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
force, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
might, 1
go, 1
and, 1
die, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
fastened, 1
on, 1
the, 1
inside., 1
All, 1
around, 1
him, 1
were, 1
lying, 1
the, 1
Palikares,, 1
writhing, 1
in, 1
convulsive, 1
agonies,, 1
while, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
who, 1
were, 1
only, 1
slightly, 1
wounded, 1
were, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
by, 1
springing, 1
from, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
At, 1
this, 1
crisis, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
flooring, 1
suddenly, 1
gave, 1
way,, 1
my, 1
father, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
one, 1
knee,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
twenty, 1
hands, 1
were, 1
thrust, 1
forth,, 1
armed, 1
with, 1
sabres,, 1
pistols,, 1
and, 1
poniards--twenty, 1
blows, 1
were, 1
instantaneously, 1
directed, 1
against, 1
one, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
father, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
a, 1
whirlwind, 1
of, 1
fire, 1
and, 1
smoke, 1
kindled, 1
by, 1
these, 1
demons,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
hell, 1
itself, 1
opening, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
I, 1
felt, 1
myself, 1
fall, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
had, 1
fainted.", 1
Haidee's, 1
arms, 1
fell, 1
by, 1
her, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
groan,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
looking, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
count, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
satisfied, 1
with, 1
her, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1
his, 1
commands., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
her,, 1
took, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
to, 1
her, 1
in, 1
Romaic,, 1
"Calm, 1
yourself,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
child,, 1
and, 1
take, 1
courage, 1
in, 1
remembering, 1
that, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
God, 1
who, 1
will, 1
punish, 1
traitors.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
story,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
terrified, 1
at, 1
the, 1
paleness, 1
of, 1
Haidee's, 1
countenance,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
reproach, 1
myself, 1
now, 1
for, 1
having, 1
been, 1
so, 1
cruel, 1
and, 1
thoughtless, 1
in, 1
my, 1
request.", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
nothing,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Then,, 1
patting, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
on, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
"Haidee, 1
is, 1
very, 1
courageous,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
sometimes, 1
even, 1
finds, 1
consolation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
recital, 1
of, 1
her, 1
misfortunes.", 1
"Because,, 1
my, 1
lord,", 1
said, 1
Haidee, 1
eagerly,, 1
"my, 1
miseries, 1
recall, 1
to, 1
me, 1
the, 1

of, 1
your, 1
goodness.", 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
curiosity,, 1
for, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
related, 1
what, 1
he, 1
most, 1
desired, 1
to, 1
know,--how, 1
she, 1
had, 1
become, 1
the, 1
slave, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Haidee, 1
saw, 1
at, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
the, 1
same, 1
expression, 1
pervading, 1
the, 1
countenances, 1
of, 1
her, 1
two, 1
auditors;, 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
'When, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
recovered, 1
her, 1
senses, 1
we, 1
were, 1
before, 1
the, 1
serasker., 1
'Kill,', 1
said, 1
she,, 1
'but, 1
spare, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
widow, 1
of, 1
Ali.'--'It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
me, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
must, 1
address, 1
yourself,', 1
said, 1
Koorshid., 1
"'To, 1
whom,, 1
then?'--'To, 1
your, 1
new, 1
master.', 1
"'Who, 1
and, 1
where, 1
is, 1
he?'--'He, 1
is, 1
here.', 1
"And, 1
Koorshid, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
more, 1
than, 1
any, 1
contributed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
Haidee,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
chastened, 1
anger., 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"you, 1
became, 1
the, 1
property, 1
of, 1
this, 1
man?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Haidee,, 1
"he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
dare, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
us,, 1
so, 1
we, 1
were, 1
sold, 1
to, 1
some, 1
slave-merchants, 1
who, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Constantinople., 1
We, 1
traversed, 1
Greece,, 1
and, 1
arrived, 1
half, 1
dead, 1
at, 1
the, 1
imperial, 1
gates., 1
They, 1
were, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
people,, 1
who, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
way, 1
for, 1
us, 1
to, 1
pass,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
having, 1
looked, 1
closely, 1
at, 1
an, 1
object, 1
which, 1
was, 1
attracting, 1
their, 1
attention,, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
piercing, 1
cry, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
pointing, 1
as, 1
she, 1
did, 1
so, 1
to, 1
a, 1
head, 1
which, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
gates,, 1

beneath, 1
which, 1
were, 1
inscribed, 1
these, 1
words:, 1

cried, 1
bitterly,, 1

to, 1

my, 1
mother, 1
from, 1

she, 1
was, 1
dead!, 1
I, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
the, 1
slave-market,, 1

was, 1
purchased, 1
by, 1
a, 1
rich, 1
Armenian., 1
He, 1
caused, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1

gave, 1
me, 1
masters,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
was, 1
thirteen, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age, 1

sold, 1
me, 1
to, 1

bought, 1
her,", 1

very, 1
fortunate, 1

Albert, 1
remained, 1
quite, 1
bewildered, 1
with, 1
all, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
and, 1
heard., 1

From, 1
Yanina., 1
If, 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
trembling, 1
step, 1

agitated, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
Franz, 1
when, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
even, 1
she, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
constrained, 1
to, 1
pity, 1
him., 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
only, 1
just, 1
given, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
a, 1
few, 1
incoherent, 1
sentences,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
received, 1
about, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
following, 1
letter:--, 1
"After, 1
all, 1
the, 1
disclosures, 1
which, 1
were, 1
made, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
must, 1
see, 1
the, 1
utter, 1
impossibility, 1
of, 1
any, 1
alliance, 1
being, 1
formed, 1
between, 1
his, 1
family, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Franz, 1
d'Epinay., 1
M., 1
d'Epinay, 1
must, 1
say, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
shocked, 1
and, 1
astonished, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
detailed, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
anticipated, 1
him, 1
in, 1
this, 1
announcement.", 1
No, 1
one, 1
who, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
so, 1
thoroughly, 1
unnerved, 1
by, 1
the, 1
recent, 1
inauspicious, 1
combination, 1
of, 1
circumstances,, 1
would, 1
have, 1
supposed, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
anticipated, 1
the, 1
annoyance;, 1
although, 1
it, 1
certainly, 1
never, 1
had, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
his, 1
father, 1
would, 1
carry, 1
candor,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
rudeness,, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
such, 1
a, 1
history., 1
And, 1
in, 1
justice, 1
to, 1
Villefort,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
never, 1
cared, 1
for, 1
the, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son, 1
on, 1
any, 1
subject,, 1
had, 1
always, 1
omitted, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
to, 1
Villefort,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
all, 1
his, 1
life, 1
entertained, 1
the, 1
belief, 1
that, 1
General, 1
de, 1
Quesnel,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
Baron, 1
d'Epinay,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
alternately, 1
styled,, 1
according, 1
as, 1
the, 1
speaker, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
identify, 1
him, 1
by, 1
his, 1
own, 1
family, 1
name,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
the, 1
title, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
conferred, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
fell, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
of, 1
assassination,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
killed, 1
fairly, 1
in, 1
a, 1
duel., 1
This, 1
harsh, 1
letter,, 1
coming, 1
as, 1
it, 1
did, 1
from, 1
a, 1
man, 1
generally, 1
so, 1
polite, 1
and, 1
respectful,, 1
struck, 1
a, 1
mortal, 1
blow, 1
at, 1
the, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
Villefort., 1
Hardly, 1
had, 1
he, 1
read, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
when, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
entered., 1
The, 1
sudden, 1
departure, 1
of, 1
Franz,, 1
after, 1
being, 1
summoned, 1
by, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
had, 1
so, 1
much, 1
astonished, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
position, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
left, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
the, 1
notary, 1
and, 1
the, 1
witnesses,, 1
became, 1
every, 1
moment, 1
more, 1
embarrassing., 1
Determined, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
it, 1
no, 1
longer,, 1
she, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room;, 1
saying, 1
she, 1
would, 1
go, 1
and, 1
make, 1
some, 1
inquiries, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
sudden, 1
disappearance., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
communications, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
were, 1
very, 1
limited, 1
and, 1
concise;, 1
he, 1
told, 1
her,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
that, 1
an, 1
explanation, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
between, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
and, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
Franz, 1
would, 1
consequently, 1
be, 1
broken, 1
off., 1
This, 1
was, 1
an, 1
awkward, 1
and, 1
unpleasant, 1
thing, 1
to, 1
have, 1
to, 1
report, 1
to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
were, 1
awaiting, 1
her, 1
return, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
her, 1
father-in-law., 1
She, 1
therefore, 1
contented, 1
herself, 1
with, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
having, 1
at, 1
the, 1
commencement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
discussion, 1
been, 1
attacked, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
apoplectic, 1
fit,, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
would, 1
necessarily, 1
be, 1
deferred, 1
for, 1
some, 1
days, 1
longer., 1
This, 1
news,, 1
false, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
following, 1
so, 1
singularly, 1
in, 1
the, 1
train, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
similar, 1
misfortunes, 1
which, 1
had, 1
so, 1
recently, 1
occurred,, 1
evidently, 1
astonished, 1
the, 1
auditors,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
retired, 1
without, 1
a, 1
word., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
Valentine,, 1
at, 1
once, 1
terrified, 1
and, 1
happy,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
embraced, 1
and, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
feeble, 1
old, 1
man, 1
for, 1
thus, 1
breaking, 1
with, 1
a, 1
single, 1
blow, 1
the, 1
chain, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
been, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
consider, 1
as, 1
irrefragable,, 1
asked, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
retire, 1
to, 1
her, 1
own, 1
room,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
recover, 1
her, 1
composure., 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
the, 1
permission, 1
which, 1
she, 1
solicited., 1
But, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
going, 1
to, 1
her, 1
own, 1
room,, 1
Valentine,, 1
having, 1
once, 1
gained, 1
her, 1
liberty,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
gallery,, 1
and,, 1
opening, 1
a, 1
small, 1
door, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
found, 1
herself, 1
at, 1
once, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
events, 1
which, 1
had, 1
crowded, 1
one, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
an, 1
indefinable, 1
sentiment, 1
of, 1
dread, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
Valentine's, 1
mind., 1
She, 1
expected, 1
every, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
see, 1
Morrel, 1
appear,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling,, 1
to, 1
forbid, 1
the, 1
signing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contract,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Laird, 1
of, 1
Ravenswood, 1
in, 1
"The, 1
Bride, 1
of, 1
Lammermoor.", 1
It, 1
was, 1
high, 1
time, 1
for, 1
her, 1
to, 1
make, 1
her, 1
appearance, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
for, 1
Maximilian, 1
had, 1
long, 1
awaited, 1
her, 1
coming., 1
He, 1
had, 1
half, 1
guessed, 1
what, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on, 1
when, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Franz, 1
quit, 1
the, 1
cemetery, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
He, 1
followed, 1
M., 1
d'Epinay,, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
enter,, 1
afterwards, 1
go, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
re-enter, 1
with, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
He, 1
had, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
doubts, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
conference;, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
quickly, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
in, 1
the, 1
clover-patch,, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
result, 1
of, 1
the, 1
proceedings,, 1
and, 1
very, 1
certain, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
would, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
first, 1
moment, 1
she, 1
should, 1
be, 1
set, 1
at, 1
liberty., 1
He, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken;, 1
peering, 1
through, 1
the, 1
crevices, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wooden, 1
partition,, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
cast, 1
aside, 1
all, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
precautions, 1
and, 1
walked, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
the, 1
barrier., 1
The, 1
first, 1
glance, 1
which, 1
Maximilian, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
her, 1
entirely, 1
reassured, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
first, 1
words, 1
she, 1
spoke, 1
made, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
bound, 1
with, 1
delight., 1
"We, 1
are, 1
saved!", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"Saved?", 1
repeated, 1
Morrel,, 1
not, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
conceive, 1
such, 1
intense, 1
happiness;, 1
"by, 1
whom?", 1
"By, 1
my, 1
grandfather., 1
Oh,, 1
Morrel,, 1
pray, 1
love, 1
him, 1
for, 1
all, 1
his, 1
goodness, 1
to, 1
us!", 1
Morrel, 1
swore, 1
to, 1
love, 1
him, 1
with, 1
all, 1
his, 1
soul;, 1
and, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
could, 1
safely, 1
promise, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
though, 1
it, 1
were, 1
not, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
love, 1
him, 1
merely, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
or, 1
even, 1
as, 1
a, 1
father., 1
"But, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
Valentine,, 1
how, 1
has, 1
it, 1
all, 1
been, 1
effected?, 1
What, 1
strange, 1
means, 1
has, 1
he, 1
used, 1
to, 1
compass, 1
this, 1
blessed, 1
end?", 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
relating, 1
all, 1
that, 1
had, 1
passed,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
suddenly, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
in, 1
doing, 1
so, 1
she, 1
must, 1
reveal, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
secret, 1
which, 1
concerned, 1
others, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"At, 1
some, 1
future, 1
time, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
all, 1
about, 1
it.", 1
"But, 1
when, 1
will, 1
that, 1
be?", 1
"When, 1
I, 1
am, 1
your, 1
wife.", 1
The, 1
conversation, 1
had, 1
now, 1
turned, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
topic, 1
so, 1
pleasing, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
accede, 1
to, 1
anything, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
thought, 1
fit, 1
to, 1
propose,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
likewise, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
intelligence, 1
such, 1
as, 1
he, 1
just, 1
heard, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
more, 1
than, 1
sufficient, 1
to, 1
content, 1
him, 1
for, 1
one, 1
day., 1
However,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
without, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
Valentine, 1
again, 1
the, 1
next, 1
night., 1
Valentine, 1
promised, 1
all, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
required, 1
of, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
certainly, 1
it, 1
was, 1
less, 1
difficult, 1
now, 1
for, 1
her, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
marry, 1
Maximilian, 1
than, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
ago, 1
to, 1
assure, 1
herself, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
not, 1
marry, 1
Franz., 1
During, 1
the, 1
time, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
interview, 1
we, 1
have, 1
just, 1
detailed,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
M., 1
Noirtier., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
that, 1
stern, 1
and, 1
forbidding, 1
expression, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
her., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
superfluous, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
Valentine's, 1
marriage, 1
is, 1
broken, 1
off,, 1
since, 1
it, 1
was, 1
here, 1
that, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
was, 1
concluded.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
countenance, 1
remained, 1
immovable., 1
"But, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
you, 1
are, 1
aware;, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
been, 1
opposed, 1
to, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
was, 1
entered, 1
into, 1
entirely, 1
without, 1
my, 1
consent, 1
or, 1
approbation.", 1
Noirtier, 1
regarded, 1
his, 1
daughter-in-law, 1
with, 1
the, 1
look, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
desiring, 1
an, 1
explanation., 1
"Now, 1
that, 1
this, 1
marriage,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
know, 1
you, 1
so, 1
much, 1
disliked,, 1
is, 1
done, 1
away, 1
with,, 1
I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
you, 1
on, 1
an, 1
errand, 1
which, 1
neither, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
nor, 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
consistently, 1
undertake.", 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes, 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
her, 1
mission., 1
"I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
entreat, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
continued, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"as, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
who, 1
has, 1
the, 1
right, 1
of, 1
doing, 1
so,, 1
inasmuch, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
who, 1
will, 1
receive, 1
no, 1
personal, 1
benefit, 1
from, 1
the, 1
transaction,--I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
entreat, 1
you, 1
to, 1
restore,, 1
not, 1
your, 1
love,, 1
for, 1
that, 1
she, 1
has, 1
always, 1
possessed,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1
your, 1
granddaughter.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
doubtful, 1
expression, 1
in, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
motive, 1
of, 1
this, 1
proceeding,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
succeed, 1
in, 1
doing, 1
so., 1
"May, 1
I, 1
hope,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"that, 1
your, 1
intentions, 1
accord, 1
with, 1
my, 1
request?", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
they, 1
did., 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case,, 1
sir,", 1
rejoined, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
gratitude, 1
and, 1
happiness, 1
at, 1
your, 1
prompt, 1
acquiescence, 1
to, 1
my, 1
wishes.", 1
She, 1
then, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
retired., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
the, 1
notary;, 1
the, 1
first, 1
will, 1
was, 1
torn, 1
up, 1
and, 1
a, 1
second, 1
made,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
on, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
she, 1
should, 1
never, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
generally, 1
reported, 1
that, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
the, 1
heiress, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marquis, 1
and, 1
marchioness, 1
of, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
had, 1
regained, 1
the, 1
good, 1
graces, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
she, 1
would, 1
ultimately, 1
be, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
300,000, 1
livres., 1
While, 1
all, 1
the, 1
proceedings, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dissolution, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marriage-contract, 1
were, 1
being, 1
carried, 1
on, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
paid, 1
his, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
no, 1
time, 1
in, 1
responding, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Danglars', 1
wishes,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
all, 1
due, 1
deference, 1
to, 1
his, 1
position, 1
in, 1
society,, 1
donned, 1
his, 1
uniform, 1
of, 1
lieutenant-general,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
ornamented, 1
with, 1
all, 1
his, 1
crosses,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
attired,, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
finest, 1
horses, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Chausse, 1
d'Antin., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
balancing, 1
his, 1
monthly, 1
accounts,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
perhaps, 1
not, 1
the, 1
most, 1
favorable, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
finding, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
best, 1
humor., 1
At, 1
the, 1
first, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
old, 1
friend,, 1
Danglars, 1
assumed, 1
his, 1
majestic, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
settled, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
easy-chair., 1
Morcerf,, 1
usually, 1
so, 1
stiff, 1
and, 1
formal,, 1
accosted, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
in, 1
an, 1
affable, 1
and, 1
smiling, 1
manner,, 1
and,, 1
feeling, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
the, 1
overture, 1
he, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
make, 1
would, 1
be, 1
well, 1
received,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
consider, 1
it, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
adopt, 1
any, 1
manoeuvres, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
his, 1
end,, 1
but, 1
went, 1
at, 1
once, 1
straight, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point., 1
"Well,, 1
baron,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"here, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
last;, 1
some, 1
time, 1
has, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
our, 1
plans, 1
were, 1
formed,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
are, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
executed.", 1
Morcerf, 1
paused, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
quietly, 1
waiting, 1
till, 1
the, 1
cloud, 1
should, 1
have, 1
dispersed, 1
which, 1
had, 1
gathered, 1
on, 1
the, 1
brow, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
attributed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
silence;, 1
but,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
great, 1
surprise,, 1
it, 1
grew, 1
darker, 1
and, 1
darker., 1
"To, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
allude,, 1
monsieur?", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
were, 1
trying, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
to, 1
guess, 1
at, 1
the, 1
possible, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
general's, 1
words., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
stickler, 1
for, 1
forms,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
would, 1
remind, 1
me, 1
that, 1
the, 1
ceremonial, 1
rites, 1
should, 1
not, 1
be, 1
omitted., 1
Ma, 1
foi,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
your, 1
pardon,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
I, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
him,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
still, 1
serving, 1
my, 1
apprenticeship,, 1
you, 1
know;, 1
come,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
reform.", 1
And, 1
Morcerf, 1
with, 1
a, 1
forced, 1
smile, 1
arose,, 1
and,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
low, 1
bow, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
said:, 1
"Baron,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
asking, 1
of, 1
you, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
Danglars, 1
for, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
the, 1
Vicomte, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
But, 1
Danglars,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
receiving, 1
this, 1
address, 1
in, 1
the, 1
favorable, 1
manner, 1
which, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
expected,, 1
knit, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
inviting, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
still, 1
standing,, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
seat,, 1
he, 1
said:, 1
"Monsieur,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
reflect, 1
before, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
an, 1
answer.", 1
"To, 1
reflect?", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
more, 1
and, 1
more, 1
astonished;, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
had, 1
enough, 1
time, 1
for, 1
reflection, 1
during, 1
the, 1
eight, 1
years, 1
which, 1
have, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
this, 1
marriage, 1
was, 1
first, 1
discussed, 1
between, 1
us?", 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
"things, 1
are, 1
constantly, 1
occurring, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
to, 1
induce, 1
us, 1
to, 1
lay, 1
aside, 1
our, 1
most, 1
established, 1
opinions,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
all, 1
events, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
us, 1
to, 1
remodel, 1
them, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
change, 1
of, 1
circumstances,, 1
which, 1
may, 1
have, 1
placed, 1
affairs, 1
in, 1
a, 1
totally, 1
different, 1
light, 1
to, 1
that, 1
in, 1
which, 1
we, 1
at, 1
first, 1
viewed, 1
them.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
you,, 1
baron,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf., 1
"What, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
is, 1
this,, 1
sir,--that, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fortnight, 1
unforeseen, 1
circumstances, 1
have, 1
occurred"--, 1
"Excuse, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"but, 1
is, 1
it, 1
a, 1
play, 1
we, 1
are, 1
acting?", 1
"A, 1
play?", 1
"Yes,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
is, 1
like, 1
one;, 1
pray, 1
let, 1
us, 1
come, 1
more, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point,, 1
and, 1
endeavor, 1
thoroughly, 1
to, 1
understand, 1

"That, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
my, 1
desire.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"I, 1
see, 1
him, 1
very, 1
often,", 1

Danglars,, 1
drawing, 1
himself, 1
up;, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
particular, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine.", 1
"Well,, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
your, 1
late, 1
conversations, 1
with, 1
him,, 1
you, 1

irresolute, 1

so.", 1
"Well,, 1

am,, 1

entreating, 1
you, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
your, 1
promise, 1
on, 1

Danglars, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
so, 1
soon, 1
changed, 1
your, 1
mind,", 1
added, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"or, 1
have, 1
you, 1
only, 1
provoked, 1
my, 1
request, 1
that, 1

pleasure, 1
of, 1

continued, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
in, 1
the, 1

tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
begun, 1

"Count,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
doubtless, 1
be, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
my, 1
reserve,, 1

was, 1
piqued, 1
at, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
just, 1
assumed., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
without, 1
a, 1
good, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
my, 1
conduct,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
banker., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say?", 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
good, 1
reason,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
explain.", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
be, 1
aware,, 1
at, 1
all, 1
events,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
motives, 1
before, 1
they, 1
are, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
one, 1
thing, 1
at, 1
least, 1
is, 1
clear,, 1
which, 1
is,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
decline, 1
allying, 1
yourself, 1
with, 1
my, 1
family.", 1
"No,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
"I, 1
merely, 1
suspend, 1
my, 1
decision,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
really, 1
flatter, 1
yourself, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
all, 1
your, 1
caprices,, 1
and, 1
quietly, 1
and, 1
humbly, 1
await, 1
the, 1
time, 1
of, 1
again, 1
being, 1
received, 1
into, 1
your, 1
good, 1
graces?", 1
"Then,, 1
count,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
wait,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
these, 1
projects, 1
as, 1
if, 1
they, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
entertained.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bit, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
till, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
almost, 1
started,, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
ebullition, 1
of, 1
anger, 1
which, 1
his, 1
proud, 1
and, 1
irritable, 1
temper, 1
scarcely, 1
allowed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
restrain;, 1
understanding,, 1
however,, 1
that, 1
in, 1
the, 1
present, 1
state, 1
of, 1
things, 1
the, 1
laugh, 1
would, 1
decidedly, 1
be, 1
against, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
from, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
towards, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
directing, 1
his, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
confronted, 1
the, 1
banker., 1
A, 1
cloud, 1
settled, 1
on, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
evincing, 1
decided, 1
anxiety, 1
and, 1
uneasiness,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
offended, 1
pride, 1
which, 1
had, 1
lately, 1
reigned, 1
there., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Danglars,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
acquainted, 1
for, 1
many, 1
years,, 1
and, 1
consequently, 1
we, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
make, 1
some, 1
allowance, 1
for, 1
each, 1
other's, 1
failings., 1
You, 1
owe, 1
me, 1
an, 1
explanation,, 1
and, 1
really, 1
it, 1
is, 1
but, 1
fair, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
know, 1
what, 1
circumstance, 1
has, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
deprive, 1
my, 1
son, 1
of, 1
your, 1
favor.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
from, 1
no, 1
personal, 1
ill-feeling, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
viscount,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
insolent, 1
manner, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
Morcerf, 1
was, 1
a, 1
little, 1
softened, 1
and, 1
calmed, 1
down., 1
"And, 1
towards, 1
whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
bear, 1
this, 1
personal, 1
ill-feeling,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
turning, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
anger., 1
The, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
face, 1
had, 1
not, 1
remained, 1
unperceived, 1
by, 1
the, 1
banker;, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
him, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
greater, 1
assurance, 1
than, 1
before,, 1
and, 1
said:, 1
"You, 1
may,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
better, 1
satisfied, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
go, 1
farther, 1
into, 1
particulars.", 1
A, 1
tremor, 1
of, 1
suppressed, 1
rage, 1
shook, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
frame, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
making, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
effort, 1
over, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
said:, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
insist, 1
on, 1
your, 1
giving, 1
me, 1
an, 1
explanation., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
who, 1
has, 1
displeased, 1
you?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
my, 1
fortune, 1
which, 1
you, 1
find, 1
insufficient?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
because, 1
my, 1
opinions, 1
differ, 1
from, 1
yours?", 1
"Nothing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kind,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars:, 1
"if, 1
such, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
only, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
to, 1
blame,, 1
inasmuch, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
all, 1
these, 1
things, 1
when, 1
I, 1
made, 1
the, 1
engagement., 1
No,, 1

not, 1
seek, 1
any, 1
longer, 1
to, 1
discover, 1

reason., 1
I, 1
really, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
ashamed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
your, 1
undergoing, 1
such, 1
severe, 1
self-examination;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
drop, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1
and, 1
adopt, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
course, 1
of, 1
delay,, 1
which, 1
implies, 1
neither, 1
a, 1
rupture, 1

My, 1
daughter, 1
is, 1
only, 1
seventeen, 1
years, 1
old,, 1

your, 1
son, 1
twenty-one., 1
While, 1
we, 1
wait,, 1
time, 1
will, 1
be, 1
progressing,, 1
events, 1
will, 1
succeed, 1
each, 1
other;, 1
things, 1
which, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
look, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
obscure,, 1
appear, 1
but, 1
too, 1
clearly, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
sometimes, 1
the, 1
utterance, 1
of, 1
one, 1
word,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
lapse, 1
of, 1
a, 1
single, 1
day,, 1
will, 1
reveal, 1
the, 1
most, 1
cruel, 1
calumnies.", 1
"Calumnies,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
sir?", 1
cried, 1
Morcerf,, 1
turning, 1
livid, 1
with, 1
rage., 1
"Does, 1
any, 1
one, 1
dare, 1
to, 1
slander, 1
me?", 1
"Monsieur,, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
considered, 1
it, 1
best, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
all, 1
explanation.", 1
"Then,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
patiently, 1
to, 1
submit, 1
to, 1
your, 1
refusal?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
although, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
the, 1
refusal, 1
is, 1
as, 1
painful, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
give, 1
as, 1
it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
you, 1
to, 1
receive,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
had, 1
reckoned, 1
on, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
your, 1
alliance,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
breaking, 1
off, 1
of, 1
a, 1
marriage, 1
contract, 1
always, 1
injures, 1
the, 1
lady, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
gentleman.", 1
"Enough,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"we, 1
will, 1
speak, 1
no, 1
more, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject.", 1
And, 1
clutching, 1
his, 1
gloves, 1
in, 1
anger,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
apartment., 1
Danglars, 1
observed, 1
that, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
conversation, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
never, 1
once, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
if, 1
it, 1
was, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
account, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
recalled, 1
his, 1
word., 1
That, 1
evening, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
long, 1
conference, 1
with, 1
several, 1
friends;, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
with, 1
the, 1
ladies,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
last, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
house., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning,, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
he, 1
awoke,, 1
Danglars, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
the, 1
newspapers;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
laid, 1
aside, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
last, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Impartial,, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
of, 1
which, 1
Beauchamp, 1
was, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
editor., 1
He, 1
hastily, 1
tore, 1
off, 1
the, 1
cover,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
journal, 1
with, 1
nervous, 1
precipitation,, 1
passed, 1
contemptuously, 1
over, 1
the, 1
Paris, 1
jottings,, 1
and, 1
arriving, 1
at, 1
the, 1
miscellaneous, 1
intelligence,, 1
stopped, 1
with, 1
a, 1
malicious, 1
smile,, 1
at, 1
a, 1
paragraph, 1
headed, 1
"We, 1
hear, 1
from, 1
Yanina.", 1
"Very, 1
good,", 1
observed, 1
Danglars,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
read, 1
the, 1
paragraph;, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
little, 1
article, 1
on, 1
Colonel, 1
Fernand,, 1
which,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
mistaken,, 1
would, 1
render, 1
the, 1
explanation, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
required, 1
of, 1
me, 1
perfectly, 1
unnecessary.", 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
black, 1
coat, 1
buttoned, 1
up, 1
to, 1
his, 1
chin,, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
walking, 1
with, 1
a, 1
quick, 1
and, 1
agitated, 1
step, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees., 1
When, 1
he, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
informed, 1
him, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
out, 1
about, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
previously., 1
"Did, 1
he, 1
take, 1
Baptistin, 1
with, 1
him?", 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
lord.", 1
"Call, 1
him,, 1
then;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
went, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
him, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant., 1
"My, 1
good, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
my, 1
intrusion,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
was, 1
anxious, 1
to, 1
know, 1
from, 1
your, 1
own, 1
mouth, 1
if, 1
your, 1
master, 1
was, 1
really, 1
out, 1
or, 1
not.", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
really, 1
out,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Baptistin., 1
"Out,, 1
even, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
how, 1
happy, 1
my, 1
master, 1
always, 1
is, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
the, 1
vicomte,", 1
said, 1
Baptistin;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
therefore, 1
never, 1
think, 1
of, 1
including, 1
him, 1
in, 1
any, 1
general, 1
order.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
and, 1
now, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him, 1
on, 1
an, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
great, 1
importance., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
long, 1
before, 1
he, 1
comes, 1
in?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
not,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
breakfast, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
take, 1
a, 1
turn, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
I, 1
will, 1
return, 1
here;, 1
meanwhile,, 1
if, 1
the, 1
count, 1
should, 1
come, 1
in,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
beg, 1
him, 1
not, 1
to, 1
go, 1
out, 1
again, 1
without, 1
seeing, 1
me?", 1
"You, 1
may, 1
depend, 1
on, 1
my, 1
doing, 1
so,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Baptistin., 1
Albert, 1
left, 1
the, 1
cab, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
door,, 1
intending, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
turn, 1
on, 1
foot., 1
As, 1
he, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
Allee, 1
des, 1
Veuves,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
horses, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
Gosset's, 1
shooting-gallery;, 1
he, 1
approached,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
coachman., 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
count, 1
shooting, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gallery?", 1
said, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
coachman., 1
While, 1
he, 1
was, 1
speaking,, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
report, 1
of, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
pistol-shots., 1
He, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way, 1
met, 1
the, 1
waiter., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
lord,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
lad;, 1
"but, 1
will, 1
you, 1
have, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
moment?", 1
"What, 1
for,, 1
Philip?", 1
asked, 1
Albert,, 1
who,, 1
being, 1
a, 1
constant, 1
visitor, 1
there,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
this, 1
opposition, 1
to, 1
his, 1
entrance., 1
"Because, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
is, 1
now, 1
in, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
prefers, 1
being, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
never, 1
practices, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
any, 1
one.", 1
"Not, 1
even, 1
before, 1
you,, 1
Philip?, 1
Then, 1
who, 1
loads, 1
his, 1
pistol?", 1
"His, 1
servant.", 1
"A, 1
Nubian?", 1
"A, 1
negro.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
he,, 1
then.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this, 1
gentleman?", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
come, 1
to, 1
look, 1
for, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine.", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
another, 1
thing,, 1
then., 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
immediately, 1
and, 1
inform, 1
him, 1
of, 1
your, 1
arrival.", 1
And, 1
Philip,, 1
urged, 1
by, 1
his, 1
own, 1
curiosity,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
gallery;, 1
a, 1
second, 1
afterwards,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold., 1
"I, 1
ask, 1
your, 1
pardon,, 1

Albert,, 1
"for, 1
following, 1
you, 1
here,, 1

I, 1
must, 1
first, 1
tell, 1
you, 1

I, 1
alone, 1

to, 1
blame, 1
for, 1

I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
your, 1

turned, 1
up, 1

Morcerf, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
target,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
some, 1
playing-cards, 1
fixed, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
At, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
Albert, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
suit,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
counted, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ace, 1
to, 1

ten., 1
"Ah,, 1

Albert,, 1
"I, 1

Albert., 1
"Those, 1
are, 1
really, 1

shots, 1

Albert, 1
approached., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
bullets, 1
had, 1
actually, 1
pierced, 1
the, 1
cards, 1
in, 1

"Diable,", 1

Morcerf., 1
"What, 1
would, 1

But, 1
come,, 1

Both, 1
men, 1
entered, 1

Albert, 1
into, 1

to, 1
a, 1
seat,, 1
placed, 1
another, 1
for, 1
himself., 1
"Now, 1

us, 1
talk, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
over, 1
quietly,", 1

the, 1
count., 1
"You, 1

Albert., 1
"With, 1

to, 1
you?", 1
"There, 1
appeared, 1

night--but, 1
wait,, 1

And, 1
Albert, 1
handed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
read, 1

in, 1
it?", 1
"Yes;, 1

the, 1
misfortune, 1
to"--, 1

told, 1
you,, 1

of, 1
advice.", 1

you, 1

one.", 1

what, 1
is, 1
your, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
advising, 1
me, 1
to, 1

alone?", 1

the, 1
affair, 1
will, 1
rest, 1
between, 1
you, 1

Beauchamp.", 1
"Explain, 1
yourself.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
so., 1
If, 1
Beauchamp, 1
be, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1
retract,, 1

ought, 1
at, 1

to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1

you, 1
to, 1

me, 1

so,, 1

count.", 1
Morcerf, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
He, 1
found, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
doing, 1
his, 1
utmost, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
his, 1
anger, 1
he, 1
went, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
find, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
office., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
gloomy,, 1
dusty-looking, 1
apartment,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
journalists', 1
offices, 1
have, 1
always, 1
been, 1
from, 1
time, 1
immemorial., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
announced, 1
M., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf., 1
Beauchamp, 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
name, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
aright,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
gave, 1
orders, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
admitted., 1
Albert, 1
entered., 1
Beauchamp, 1
uttered, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
surprise, 1
on, 1
seeing, 1
his, 1
friend, 1
leap, 1
over, 1
and, 1
trample, 1
under, 1
foot, 1
all, 1
the, 1
newspapers, 1
which, 1
were, 1
strewed, 1
about, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"This, 1
way,, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Albert!", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
holding, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
out, 1
of, 1
your, 1
senses,, 1

do, 1
you, 1
come, 1
peaceably, 1
to, 1
take, 1
breakfast, 1
with, 1
me?, 1
Try, 1
and, 1
find, 1
a, 1
seat--there, 1
is, 1
one, 1
by, 1
that, 1
geranium,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
only, 1
thing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1

remind, 1
me, 1
that, 1
there, 1
are, 1
other, 1
leaves, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
besides, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
paper.", 1
"Beauchamp,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
of, 1
your, 1
journal, 1
that, 1
I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
speak.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
say, 1
about, 1
it?", 1
"I, 1
desire, 1
that, 1
a, 1
statement, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
rectified.", 1
"To, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
refer?, 1
But, 1
pray, 1
sit, 1
down.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
formal, 1
bow., 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
now, 1
have, 1
the, 1
kindness, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
the, 1
nature, 1
of, 1
the, 1
statement, 1
which, 1
has, 1
displeased, 1
you?", 1
"An, 1
announcement, 1
has, 1
been, 1
made, 1
which, 1
implicates, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
member, 1
of, 1
my, 1
family.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
much, 1
surprised;, 1
"surely, 1
you, 1
must, 1
be, 1
mistaken.", 1
"The, 1
story, 1
sent, 1
you, 1
from, 1
Yanina.", 1
"Yanina?", 1
"Yes;, 1
really, 1
you, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
be, 1
totally, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
which, 1
brings, 1
me, 1
here.", 1
"Such, 1
is, 1
really, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
honor!, 1
Baptiste,, 1
give, 1
me, 1
yesterday's, 1
paper,", 1
cried, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Here,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
brought, 1
mine, 1
with, 1
me,", 1
replied, 1
Albert., 1
Beauchamp, 1
took, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
read, 1
the, 1
article, 1
to, 1
which, 1
Albert, 1
pointed, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone., 1
"You, 1
see, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
annoyance,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
when, 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
the, 1
perusal, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paragraph., 1
"Is, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
referred, 1
to, 1
a, 1
relation, 1
of, 1
yours,, 1
then?", 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
journalist., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
blushing., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
do, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
mildly., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
you, 1
to, 1
contradict, 1
this, 1
statement.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
a, 1
benevolent, 1
expression., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"this, 1
matter, 1
will, 1
want, 1
a, 1
good, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
talking, 1
over;, 1
a, 1
retractation, 1
is, 1
always, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
thing,, 1
you, 1
know., 1
Sit, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
read, 1
it, 1
again.", 1
Albert, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp, 1
read,, 1
with, 1
more, 1
attention, 1
than, 1
at, 1
first,, 1
the, 1
lines, 1
denounced, 1
by, 1
his, 1
friend., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
in, 1
a, 1
determined, 1
tone,, 1
"you, 1
see, 1
that, 1
your, 1
paper, 1
his, 1
insulted, 1
a, 1
member, 1
of, 1
my, 1
family,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
insist, 1
on, 1
a, 1
retractation, 1
being, 1
made.", 1
"You, 1
insist?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
insist.", 1
"Permit, 1
me, 1
to, 1
remind, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chamber,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Viscount.", 1
"Nor, 1
do, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
there,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
rising., 1
"I, 1
repeat, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
have, 1
the, 1
announcement, 1
of, 1
yesterday, 1
contradicted., 1
You, 1
have, 1
known, 1
me, 1
long, 1
enough,", 1
continued, 1
Albert,, 1
biting, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
convulsively,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
anger, 1
was, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
rise,--"you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
sufficiently, 1
intimate, 1
with, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
my, 1
resolution, 1
on, 1
this, 1
point.", 1
"If, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
your, 1
friend,, 1
Morcerf,, 1
your, 1
present, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
speaking, 1
would, 1
almost, 1
lead, 1
me, 1
to, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
bore, 1
that, 1
title., 1
But, 1
wait, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
us, 1
get, 1
angry,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
not, 1
yet., 1
You, 1
are, 1
irritated, 1
and, 1
vexed--tell, 1
me, 1
how, 1
this, 1
Fernand, 1
is, 1
related, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
my, 1
father,", 1
said, 1
Albert--"M., 1
Fernand, 1
Mondego,, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
an, 1
old, 1
soldier, 1
who, 1
has, 1
fought, 1
in, 1
twenty, 1
battles, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
honorable, 1
scars, 1
they, 1
would, 1
denounce, 1
as, 1
badges, 1
of, 1
disgrace.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
your, 1
father?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
another, 1
thing., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
can, 1
well, 1
understand, 1
your, 1
indignation,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Albert., 1
I, 1
will, 1
look, 1
at, 1
it, 1
again;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
read, 1
the, 1
paragraph, 1
for, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time,, 1
laying, 1
a, 1
stress, 1
on, 1
each, 1
word, 1
as, 1
he, 1
proceeded., 1
"But, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
nowhere, 1
identifies, 1
this, 1
Fernand, 1
with, 1
your, 1
father.", 1
"No;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
connection, 1
will, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
by, 1
others,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
will, 1
have, 1
the, 1
article, 1
contradicted.", 1
At, 1
the, 1
words, 1
"I, 1
will,", 1
Beauchamp, 1
steadily, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
Albert's, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
as, 1
gradually, 1
lowering, 1
them,, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
thoughtful, 1
for, 1
a, 1
few, 1
moments., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
retract, 1
this, 1
assertion,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
Beauchamp?", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
increased, 1
though, 1
stifled, 1
anger., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Immediately?", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"When, 1
I, 1
am, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
the, 1
statement, 1
is, 1
false.", 1
"What?", 1
"The, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
looking, 1
into,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
pains, 1
to, 1
investigate, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
thoroughly.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
is, 1
there, 1
to, 1
investigate,, 1
sir?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
enraged, 1
beyond, 1
measure, 1
at, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
last, 1
remark., 1
"If, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
say, 1
so, 1
immediately;, 1
and, 1
if,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
you, 1
believe, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
him,, 1
state, 1
your, 1
reasons, 1
for, 1
doing, 1
so.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
the, 1
smile, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
in, 1
its, 1
numerous, 1
modifications, 1
served, 1
to, 1
express, 1
every, 1
varied, 1
emotion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
he,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
came, 1
to, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
demanding, 1
satisfaction,, 1
you, 1
should, 1
have, 1
gone, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
have, 1
entertained, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
idle, 1
conversation, 1
to, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
patiently, 1
listening, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
half, 1
hour., 1
Am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
put, 1
this, 1
construction, 1
on, 1
your, 1
visit?", 1
"Yes,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
retract, 1
that, 1
infamous, 1
calumny.", 1
"Wait, 1
a, 1
moment--no, 1
threats,, 1

you, 1
please,, 1
M., 1
Fernand, 1
Mondego,, 1
Vicomte, 1
de, 1
Morcerf;, 1
I, 1
never, 1
allow, 1
them, 1
from, 1
my, 1
enemies,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
put, 1
up, 1
with, 1
them, 1
from, 1
my, 1
friends., 1
You, 1
insist, 1
on, 1
my, 1
contradicting, 1
the, 1
article, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
General, 1
Fernand,, 1
an, 1
article, 1
with, 1
which,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
on, 1
my, 1
word, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
whatever, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
insist, 1
on, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
whose, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
get, 1
bewildered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
his, 1
feelings., 1
"And, 1
if, 1
I, 1
refuse, 1
to, 1
retract,, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
fight,, 1
do, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
in, 1
a, 1
calm, 1
tone., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
voice., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
answer,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir., 1
The, 1
article, 1
was, 1
not, 1
inserted, 1
by, 1
me--I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
even, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
have,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
step, 1
you, 1
have, 1
taken,, 1
called, 1
my, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1

it, 1
will, 1

contradicted, 1

confirmed, 1
by, 1
some, 1
one, 1
who, 1
has, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
"Sir,", 1

Albert,, 1
rising,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
do, 1
myself, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
sending, 1
my, 1
seconds, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
kind, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
arrange, 1
with, 1
them, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
meeting, 1
and, 1
the, 1
weapons.", 1
"Certainly,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir.", 1
"And, 1
this, 1
evening,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1

to-morrow, 1
at, 1
the, 1
latest,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
meet.", 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
at, 1
the, 1
proper, 1
time;, 1
but, 1
in, 1
my, 1
opinion, 1
(and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
dictate, 1
the, 1
preliminaries,, 1

it, 1
is, 1
I, 1
who, 1
have, 1
received, 1
the, 1
provocation)--in, 1
my, 1
opinion, 1
the, 1
time, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
yet., 1
I, 1
know, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
well, 1
skilled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
management, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sword,, 1
while, 1
I, 1
am, 1
only, 1
moderately, 1
so;, 1
I, 1
know,, 1
too,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
good, 1
marksman--there, 1
we, 1
are, 1
about, 1
equal., 1
I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
a, 1
duel, 1
between, 1
us, 1
two, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
serious, 1
affair,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
brave,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
brave, 1
also., 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
therefore, 1
wish, 1
either, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
you,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
be, 1
killed, 1
myself, 1
without, 1
a, 1
cause., 1
Now,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
put, 1
a, 1
question, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
very, 1
much, 1
to, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
too., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
insist, 1
on, 1
this, 1
retractation, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
me, 1
if, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
make, 1
it,, 1
although, 1
I, 1
have, 1
repeated, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once,, 1
and, 1
affirmed, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor,, 1
that, 1

of, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
with, 1

of, 1

the, 1

of, 1
Fernand?", 1

maintain, 1
my, 1
original, 1
resolution.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir;, 1
then, 1
I, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
throats, 1
with, 1
you., 1
But, 1
I, 1
require, 1
three, 1
weeks', 1
preparation;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
that, 1
time, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
come, 1

to, 1
you,, 1

false,, 1

I, 1
retract, 1
it,', 1

'The, 1
assertion, 1
is, 1
true,', 1

I, 1
shall, 1
immediately, 1
draw, 1
the, 1
sword, 1
from, 1
its, 1
sheath,, 1

the, 1
pistols, 1
from, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
whichever, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
"Three, 1
weeks!", 1
cried, 1
Albert;, 1
"they, 1
will, 1
pass, 1
as, 1
slowly, 1
as, 1
three, 1
centuries, 1
when, 1
I, 1
am, 1
all, 1
the, 1
time, 1
suffering, 1
dishonor.", 1
"Had, 1
you, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
on, 1
amicable, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
'Patience,, 1
my, 1
friend;', 1
but, 1
you, 1
have, 1
constituted, 1
yourself, 1
my, 1
enemy,, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
say,, 1
'What, 1
does, 1
that, 1
signify, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
sir?'", 1
"Well,, 1
let, 1
it, 1
be, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf;, 1
"but, 1
remember,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
that, 1
time, 1
no, 1
delay, 1
or, 1
subterfuge, 1
will, 1
justify, 1
you, 1
in"--, 1
"M., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
rising, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
throw, 1
you, 1
out, 1
of, 1
window, 1
for, 1
three, 1
weeks--that, 1
is, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
for, 1
twenty-four, 1
days, 1
to, 1
come--nor, 1
have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
right, 1
to, 1
split, 1
my, 1
skull, 1
open, 1
till, 1
that, 1
time, 1
has, 1
elapsed., 1
To-day, 1
is, 1
the, 1
29th, 1
of, 1
August;, 1
the, 1
21st, 1
of, 1
September, 1
will,, 1
therefore,, 1
be, 1
the, 1
conclusion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
term, 1
agreed, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
till, 1
that, 1
time, 1
arrives--and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
advice, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
which, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you--till, 1
then, 1
we, 1
will, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
growling, 1
and, 1
barking, 1
like, 1
two, 1
dogs, 1
chained, 1
within, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
each, 1
other.", 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
concluded, 1
his, 1
speech,, 1
Beauchamp, 1
bowed, 1
coldly, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
back, 1
upon, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
press-room., 1
Albert, 1
vented, 1
his, 1
anger, 1
on, 1
a, 1
pile, 1
of, 1
newspapers,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
flying, 1
all, 1
over, 1
the, 1
office, 1
by, 1
switching, 1
them, 1
violently, 1
with, 1
his, 1
stick;, 1
after, 1
which, 1
ebullition, 1
he, 1
departed--not,, 1
however,, 1
without, 1
walking, 1
several, 1
times, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
press-room,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
half, 1
a, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
While, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
lashing, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
newspapers, 1
which, 1
were, 1
the, 1
innocent, 1
agents, 1
of, 1
his, 1
discomfiture,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
crossing, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
walking, 1
with, 1
a, 1
quick, 1
step, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
eye., 1
He, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
the, 1
Chinese, 1
Baths,, 1
and, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
come, 1
from, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Porte, 1
Saint-Martin,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
be, 1
going, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Madeleine., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
"there, 1
goes, 1
a, 1
happy, 1
man!", 1
And, 1
it, 1
so, 1
happened, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
not, 1
mistaken, 1
in, 1
his, 1
opinion., 1
Chapter, 1
79., 1
The, 1
Lemonade., 1
Morrel, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
very, 1
happy., 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
had, 1
just, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
such, 1
haste, 1
to, 1
know, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
of, 1
his, 1
doing, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
stopped, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
cab,, 1
placing, 1
infinitely, 1
more, 1
dependence, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
two, 1
legs, 1
than, 1
on, 1
the, 1
four, 1
legs, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cab-horse., 1
He, 1
had, 1
therefore, 1
set, 1
off, 1
at, 1
a, 1
furious, 1
rate, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
hastening, 1
with, 1
rapid, 1
strides, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore., 1
Morrel, 1
advanced, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firm,, 1
manly, 1
tread,, 1
and, 1
poor, 1
Barrois, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
as, 1
he, 1
best, 1
might., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
only, 1
thirty-one,, 1
Barrois, 1
was, 1
sixty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age;, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
deeply, 1
in, 1
love,, 1
and, 1
Barrois, 1
was, 1
dying, 1
with, 1
heat, 1
and, 1
exertion., 1
These, 1
two, 1
men,, 1
thus, 1
opposed, 1
in, 1
age, 1
and, 1
interests,, 1
resembled, 1
two, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
a, 1
triangle,, 1
presenting, 1
the, 1
extremes, 1
of, 1
separation,, 1
yet, 1
nevertheless, 1
possessing, 1
their, 1
point, 1
of, 1
union., 1
This, 1
point, 1
of, 1
union, 1
was, 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
he, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
request, 1
that, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
would, 1
lose, 1
no, 1
time, 1
in, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
him--a, 1
command, 1
which, 1
Morrel, 1
obeyed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
great, 1
discomfiture, 1
of, 1
Barrois., 1
On, 1
arriving, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
not, 1
even, 1
out, 1
of, 1
breath,, 1
for, 1
love, 1
lends, 1
wings, 1
to, 1
our, 1
desires;, 1
but, 1
Barrois,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
long, 1
forgotten, 1
what, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
love,, 1
was, 1
sorely, 1
fatigued, 1
by, 1
the, 1
expedition, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
constrained, 1
to, 1
use., 1
The, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
introduced, 1
Morrel, 1
by, 1
a, 1
private, 1
entrance,, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
study,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
the, 1
rustling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dress, 1
announced, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
Valentine., 1
She, 1
looked, 1
marvellously, 1
beautiful, 1
in, 1
her, 1
deep, 1
mourning, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
experienced, 1
such, 1
intense, 1
delight, 1
in, 1
gazing, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
that, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
could, 1
almost, 1
have, 1
dispensed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
of, 1
her, 1
grandfather., 1
But, 1
the, 1
easy-chair, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
rolling, 1
along, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
made, 1
his, 1
appearance, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Noirtier, 1
acknowledged, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
extreme, 1
kindness, 1
and, 1
benevolence, 1
the, 1
thanks, 1
which, 1
Morrel, 1
lavished, 1
on, 1
him, 1
for, 1
his, 1
timely, 1
intervention, 1
on, 1
behalf, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
himself--an, 1
intervention, 1
which, 1
had, 1
saved, 1
them, 1
from, 1
despair., 1
Morrel, 1
then, 1
cast, 1
on, 1
the, 1
invalid, 1
an, 1
interrogative, 1
look, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
new, 1
favor, 1
which, 1
he, 1
designed, 1
to, 1
bestow, 1
on, 1
him., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
at, 1
a, 1
little, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
them,, 1
timidly, 1
awaiting, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
she, 1
should, 1
be, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
speak., 1
Noirtier, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
her., 1
"Am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
say, 1
what, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
"Monsieur, 1
Morrel,", 1
said, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
regarding, 1
her, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
intense, 1
interest,, 1
"my, 1
grandfather,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
had, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
things, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
told, 1
me, 1
three, 1
days, 1
ago;, 1
and, 1
now,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
repeat, 1
them, 1
to, 1
you., 1
I, 1
will, 1
repeat, 1
them,, 1
then;, 1
and, 1
since, 1
he, 1
has, 1
chosen, 1
me, 1
as, 1
his, 1
interpreter,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
faithful, 1
to, 1
the, 1
trust,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
not, 1
alter, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
his, 1
intentions.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
listening, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
impatience,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"speak,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
Valentine, 1
cast, 1
down, 1
her, 1
eyes;, 1
this, 1
was, 1
a, 1
good, 1
omen, 1
for, 1
Morrel,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
happiness, 1
could, 1
have, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
thus, 1
overcoming, 1
Valentine., 1
"My, 1
grandfather, 1
intends, 1
leaving, 1
this, 1
house,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"and, 1
Barrois, 1
is, 1
looking, 1
out, 1
suitable, 1
apartments, 1
for, 1
him, 1
in, 1
another.", 1
"But, 1
you,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort,--you,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
happiness"--, 1
"I?", 1
interrupted, 1
Valentine;, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
my, 1
grandfather,--that, 1
is, 1
an, 1
understood, 1
thing, 1
between, 1
us., 1
My, 1
apartment, 1
will, 1
be, 1
close, 1
to, 1
his., 1
Now,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
must, 1
either, 1
give, 1
his, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
this, 1
plan, 1
or, 1
his, 1
refusal;, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
case,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
leave, 1
directly,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
second,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
wait, 1
till, 1
I, 1
am, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
which, 1
will, 1
be, 1
in, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
months., 1
Then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
free,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
an, 1
independent, 1
fortune,, 1
and"--, 1
"And, 1
what?", 1
demanded, 1
Morrel., 1
"And, 1
with, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
consent, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
fulfil, 1
the, 1
promise, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
you.", 1
Valentine, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
last, 1
few, 1
words, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
Morrel's, 1
intense, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
what, 1
she, 1
was, 1
saying, 1
could, 1
have, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
them., 1
"Have, 1
I, 1
not, 1
explained, 1
your, 1
wishes,, 1
grandpapa?", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
addressing, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Yes,", 1
looked, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man.--"Once, 1
under, 1
my, 1
grandfather's, 1
roof,, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
can, 1
visit, 1
me, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
my, 1
good, 1
and, 1
worthy, 1
protector,, 1
if, 1
we, 1
still, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
the, 1
union, 1
we, 1
contemplated, 1
will, 1
be, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
insure, 1
our, 1
future, 1
comfort, 1
and, 1
happiness;, 1
in, 1
that, 1
case, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
expect, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
come, 1
and, 1
claim, 1
me, 1
at, 1
my, 1
own, 1
hands., 1
But,, 1
alas,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
said, 1
that, 1
hearts, 1
inflamed, 1
by, 1
obstacles, 1
to, 1
their, 1
desire, 1
grew, 1
cold, 1
in, 1
time, 1
of, 1
security;, 1
I, 1
trust, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
find, 1
it, 1
so, 1
in, 1
our, 1
experience!", 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
almost, 1
tempted, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
before, 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
adore, 1
them, 1
as, 1
two, 1
superior, 1
beings,, 1
"what, 1
have, 1
I, 1
ever, 1
done, 1
in, 1
my, 1
life, 1
to, 1
merit, 1
such, 1
unbounded, 1
happiness?", 1
"Until, 1
that, 1
time,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
in, 1
a, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
self-possessed, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
voice,, 1
"we, 1
will, 1
conform, 1
to, 1
circumstances,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wishes, 1
of, 1
our, 1
friends,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
those, 1
wishes, 1
do, 1
not, 1
tend, 1
finally, 1
to, 1
separate, 1
us;, 1
in, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
repeat, 1
it,, 1
because, 1
it, 1
expresses, 1
all, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
convey,--we, 1
will, 1
wait.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
make, 1
all, 1
the, 1
sacrifices, 1
which, 1
this, 1
word, 1
imposes,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"not, 1
only, 1
with, 1
resignation,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
cheerfulness.", 1
"Therefore,", 1
continued, 1
Valentine,, 1
looking, 1
playfully, 1
at, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"no, 1
more, 1
inconsiderate, 1
actions--no, 1
more, 1
rash, 1
projects;, 1
for, 1
you, 1
surely, 1
would, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
compromise, 1
one, 1
who, 1
from, 1
this, 1
day, 1
regards, 1
herself, 1
as, 1
destined,, 1
honorably, 1
and, 1
happily,, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
your, 1
name?", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
obedience, 1
to, 1
her, 1
commands., 1
Noirtier, 1
regarded, 1
the, 1
lovers, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
ineffable, 1
tenderness,, 1
while, 1
Barrois,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
the, 1
character, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
privileged, 1
to, 1
know, 1
everything, 1
that, 1
passed,, 1
smiled, 1
on, 1
the, 1
youthful, 1
couple, 1
as, 1
he, 1
wiped, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
from, 1
his, 1
bald, 1
forehead., 1
"How, 1
hot, 1
you, 1
look,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
Barrois,", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
running, 1
very, 1
fast,, 1
mademoiselle,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
must, 1
do, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
he, 1
ran, 1
still, 1
faster.", 1
Noirtier, 1
directed, 1
their, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
a, 1
waiter,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
decanter, 1
containing, 1
lemonade, 1
and, 1
a, 1
glass., 1
The, 1
decanter, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
full,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
a, 1
little,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
already, 1
drunk, 1
by, 1
M., 1
Noirtier., 1
"Come,, 1
Barrois,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
"take, 1
some, 1
of, 1
this, 1
lemonade;, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
are, 1
coveting, 1
a, 1
good, 1
draught, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"The, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
Barrois,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
dying, 1
with, 1
thirst,, 1
and, 1
since, 1
you, 1
are, 1
so, 1
kind, 1
as, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
it, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
say, 1
I, 1
should, 1
at, 1
all, 1
object, 1
to, 1
drinking, 1
your, 1
health, 1
in, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Take, 1
some,, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
come, 1
back, 1
immediately.", 1
Barrois, 1
took, 1
away, 1
the, 1
waiter,, 1
and, 1
hardly, 1
was, 1
he, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
in, 1
his, 1
haste, 1
he, 1
forgot, 1
to, 1
shut,, 1
than, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
throw, 1
back, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
empty, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
dregs, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
filled., 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
were, 1
exchanging, 1
their, 1
adieux, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
when, 1
a, 1
ring, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door-bell., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
signal, 1
of, 1
a, 1
visit., 1
Valentine, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
watch., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
past, 1
noon,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"and, 1
to-day, 1
is, 1
Saturday;, 1
I, 1
dare, 1
say, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
grandpapa.", 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
his, 1
conviction, 1
that, 1
she, 1
was, 1
right, 1
in, 1
her, 1
supposition., 1
"He, 1
will, 1
come, 1
in, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
better, 1
go,--do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
grandpapa?", 1
"Yes,", 1
signed, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Barrois,", 1
cried, 1
Valentine,, 1
"Barrois!", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
coming,, 1
mademoiselle,", 1
replied, 1
he., 1
"Barrois, 1
will, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
for, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
addressing, 1
Morrel., 1
"And, 1
now, 1
remember, 1
one, 1
thing,, 1
Monsieur, 1
Officer,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
grandfather, 1
commands, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
take, 1
any, 1
rash, 1
or, 1
ill-advised, 1
step, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
compromise, 1
our, 1
happiness.", 1
"I, 1
promised, 1
him, 1
to, 1
wait,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
wait.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Barrois, 1
entered., 1
"Who, 1
rang?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine., 1
"Doctor, 1
d'Avrigny,", 1
said, 1
Barrois,, 1
staggering, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
would, 1
fall., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
Barrois?", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer,, 1
but, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
master, 1
with, 1
wild, 1
staring, 1
eyes,, 1
while, 1
with, 1
his, 1
cramped, 1
hand, 1
he, 1
grasped, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
furniture, 1
to, 1
enable, 1
him, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
upright., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
fall!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
rigors, 1
which, 1
had, 1
attacked, 1
Barrois, 1
gradually, 1
increased,, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
the, 1
face, 1
became, 1
quite, 1
altered,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
convulsive, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
muscles, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
indicate, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
a, 1
most, 1
serious, 1
nervous, 1
disorder., 1
Noirtier,, 1
seeing, 1
Barrois, 1
in, 1
this, 1
pitiable, 1
condition,, 1
showed, 1
by, 1
his, 1
looks, 1
all, 1
the, 1
various, 1
emotions, 1
of, 1
sorrow, 1
and, 1
sympathy, 1
which, 1
can, 1
animate, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
man., 1
Barrois, 1
made, 1
some, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
master., 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
with, 1
me., 1
I, 1
am, 1
suffering--I, 1
cannot, 1
see., 1
A, 1
thousand, 1
fiery, 1
darts, 1
are, 1
piercing, 1
my, 1
brain., 1
Ah,, 1
don't, 1
touch, 1
me,, 1
pray, 1
don't.", 1
By, 1
this, 1
time, 1
his, 1
haggard, 1
eyes, 1
had, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
being, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
start, 1
from, 1
their, 1
sockets;, 1
his, 1
head, 1
fell, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
extremities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
body, 1
began, 1
to, 1
stiffen., 1
Valentine, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
horror;, 1
Morrel, 1
took, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
her, 1
from, 1
some, 1
unknown, 1
danger., 1
"M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
stifled, 1
voice., 1
"Help,, 1
help!", 1
Barrois, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
great, 1
effort, 1
stumbled, 1
a, 1
few, 1
steps,, 1
then, 1
fell, 1
at, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
resting, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
knee, 1
of, 1
the, 1
invalid,, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"My, 1
master,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
master!", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
noise,, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold., 1
Morrel, 1
relaxed, 1
his, 1
hold, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
retreating, 1
to, 1
a, 1
distant, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
remained, 1
half, 1
hidden, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
curtain., 1
Pale, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
gazing, 1
on, 1
a, 1
serpent,, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
terrified, 1
eye, 1
on, 1
the, 1
agonized, 1
sufferer., 1
Noirtier,, 1
burning, 1
with, 1
impatience, 1
and, 1
terror,, 1
was, 1
in, 1
despair, 1
at, 1
his, 1
utter, 1
inability, 1
to, 1
help, 1
his, 1
old, 1
domestic,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
regarded, 1
more, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
than, 1
a, 1
servant., 1
One, 1
might, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fearful, 1
swelling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
veins, 1
of, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
and, 1
the, 1
contraction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
muscles, 1
round, 1
the, 1
eye,, 1
trace, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
conflict, 1
which, 1
was, 1
going, 1
on, 1
between, 1
the, 1
living, 1
energetic, 1
mind, 1
and, 1
the, 1
inanimate, 1
and, 1
helpless, 1
body., 1
Barrois,, 1
his, 1
features, 1
convulsed,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
suffused, 1
with, 1
blood,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
head, 1
thrown, 1
back,, 1
was, 1
lying, 1
at, 1
full, 1
length,, 1
beating, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
had, 1
become, 1
so, 1
stiff,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
looked, 1
as, 1
if, 1
they, 1
would, 1
break, 1
rather, 1
than, 1
bend., 1
A, 1
slight, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
foam, 1
was, 1
visible, 1
around, 1
the, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
breathed, 1
painfully,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
extreme, 1
difficulty., 1
Villefort, 1
seemed, 1
stupefied, 1
with, 1
astonishment,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
gazing, 1
intently, 1
on, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
before, 1
him, 1
without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word., 1
He, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
Morrel., 1
After, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
dumb, 1
contemplation,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
his, 1
face, 1
became, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
on, 1
end,, 1
he, 1
sprang, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
crying, 1
out,, 1
"Doctor,, 1
doctor!, 1
come, 1
instantly,, 1
pray, 1
come!", 1
"Madame,, 1
madame!", 1
cried, 1
Valentine,, 1
calling, 1
her, 1
step-mother,, 1
and, 1
running, 1
up-stairs, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
her;, 1
"come, 1
quick,, 1
quick!--and, 1
bring, 1
your, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
smelling-salts, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
a, 1
harsh, 1
and, 1
constrained, 1
tone., 1
"Oh,, 1
come,, 1
come!", 1
"But, 1
where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
doctor?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Villefort;, 1
"where, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
now, 1
deliberately, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
staircase., 1
In, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
she, 1
held, 1
her, 1
handkerchief,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
wiping, 1
her, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
English, 1
smelling-salts., 1
Her, 1
first, 1
look, 1
on, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was, 1
at, 1
Noirtier,, 1
whose, 1
face,, 1
independent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
emotion, 1
which, 1
such, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
could, 1
not, 1
fail, 1
of, 1
producing,, 1
proclaimed, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
health;, 1
her, 1
second, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man., 1
She, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eye, 1
passed, 1
quickly, 1
from, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
and, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
the, 1
master., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
doctor?, 1
He, 1
was, 1
with, 1
you, 1
just, 1
now., 1
You, 1
see, 1
this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
apoplexy,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
saved, 1
if, 1
he, 1
could, 1
but, 1
be, 1
bled!", 1
"Has, 1
he, 1
eaten, 1
anything, 1
lately?", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
eluding, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
question., 1
"Madame,", 1
replied, 1
Valentine,, 1
"he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
even, 1
breakfasted., 1
He, 1
has, 1
been, 1
running, 1
very, 1
fast, 1
on, 1
an, 1
errand, 1
with, 1
which, 1
my, 1
grandfather, 1
charged, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
returned,, 1
took, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
lemonade.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"why, 1
did, 1
he, 1
not, 1
take, 1
wine?, 1
Lemonade, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
bad, 1
thing, 1
for, 1
him.", 1
"Grandpapa's, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
lemonade, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
just, 1
by, 1
his, 1
side;, 1
poor, 1
Barrois, 1
was, 1
very, 1
thirsty,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
thankful, 1
to, 1
drink, 1
anything, 1
he, 1
could, 1
find.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
started., 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
scrutiny., 1
"He, 1
has, 1
such, 1
a, 1
short, 1
neck,", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
ask, 1
where, 1
is, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny?, 1
In, 1
God's, 1
name, 1
answer, 1
me!", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
with, 1
Edward,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
not, 1
quite, 1
well,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
answering., 1
Villefort, 1
rushed, 1
up-stairs, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
him., 1
"Take, 1
this,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
giving, 1
her, 1
smelling-bottle, 1
to, 1
Valentine., 1
"They, 1
will,, 1
no, 1
doubt,, 1
bleed, 1
him;, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
will, 1
retire,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
blood;", 1
and, 1
she, 1
followed, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
up-stairs., 1
Morrel, 1
now, 1
emerged, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hiding-place,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
quite, 1
unperceived,, 1
so, 1
great, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
general, 1
confusion., 1
"Go, 1
away, 1
as, 1
quick, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"and, 1
stay, 1
till, 1
I, 1
send, 1
for, 1
you., 1
Go.", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
towards, 1
Noirtier, 1
for, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
retire., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
preserved, 1
all, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
coolness,, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
pressed, 1
Valentine's, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
left, 1
the, 1
house, 1
by, 1
a, 1
back, 1
staircase., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
an, 1
opposite, 1
door., 1
Barrois, 1
was, 1
now, 1
showing, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
returning, 1
consciousness., 1
The, 1
crisis, 1
seemed, 1
past,, 1
a, 1
low, 1
moaning, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
one, 1
knee., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
laid, 1
him, 1
on, 1
a, 1
couch., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
prescribe,, 1
doctor?", 1
demanded, 1
Villefort., 1
"Give, 1
me, 1
some, 1
water, 1
and, 1
ether., 1
You, 1
have, 1
some, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Send, 1
for, 1
some, 1
oil, 1
of, 1
turpentine, 1
and, 1
tartar, 1
emetic.", 1
Villefort, 1
immediately, 1
despatched, 1
a, 1
messenger., 1
"And, 1
now, 1
let, 1
every, 1
one, 1
retire.", 1
"Must, 1
I, 1
go, 1
too?", 1
asked, 1
Valentine, 1
timidly., 1
"Yes,, 1
mademoiselle,, 1
you, 1
especially,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
abruptly., 1
Valentine, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
with, 1
astonishment,, 1
kissed, 1
her, 1
grandfather, 1
on, 1
the, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
after, 1
her, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
air., 1
"Look,, 1
look,, 1
doctor,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
coming, 1
round, 1
again;, 1
I, 1
really, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think,, 1
after, 1
all,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
consequence.", 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
smile., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
feel,, 1
Barrois?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"A, 1
little, 1
better,, 1
sir.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
drink, 1
some, 1
of, 1
this, 1
ether, 1
and, 1
water?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
try;, 1
but, 1
don't, 1
touch, 1
me.", 1
"Why, 1
not?", 1
"Because, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
only, 1
to, 1
touch, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
tip, 1
of, 1
your, 1
finger, 1
the, 1
fit, 1
would, 1
return.", 1
"Drink.", 1
Barrois, 1
took, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and,, 1
raising, 1
it, 1
to, 1
his, 1
purple, 1
lips,, 1
took, 1
about, 1
half, 1
of, 1
the, 1
liquid, 1
offered, 1
him., 1
"Where, 1
do, 1
you, 1
suffer?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"Everywhere., 1
I, 1
feel, 1
cramps, 1
over, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
body.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
find, 1
any, 1
dazzling, 1
sensation, 1
before, 1
the, 1
eyes?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Any, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ears?", 1
"Frightful.", 1
"When, 1
did, 1
you, 1
first, 1
feel, 1
that?", 1
"Just, 1
now.", 1
"Suddenly?", 1
"Yes,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
clap, 1
of, 1
thunder.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
it, 1
yesterday, 1
or, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before?", 1
"Nothing.", 1
"No, 1
drowsiness?", 1
"None.", 1
"What, 1
have, 1
you, 1
eaten, 1
to-day?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
eaten, 1
nothing;, 1
I, 1
only, 1
drank, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
my, 1
master's, 1
lemonade--that's, 1
all;", 1
and, 1
Barrois, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
Noirtier,, 1
who,, 1
immovably, 1
fixed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arm-chair,, 1
was, 1
contemplating, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
scene, 1
without, 1
allowing, 1
a, 1
word, 1
or, 1
a, 1
movement, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
him., 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
this, 1
lemonade?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
eagerly., 1
"Down-stairs, 1
in, 1
the, 1
decanter.", 1
"Whereabouts, 1
downstairs?", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
kitchen.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
go, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
it,, 1
doctor?", 1
inquired, 1
Villefort., 1
"No,, 1
stay, 1
here, 1
and, 1
try, 1
to, 1
make, 1
Barrois, 1
drink, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
this, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
ether, 1
and, 1
water., 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
myself, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
the, 1
lemonade.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
bounded, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
flew, 1
down, 1
the, 1
back, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
knocked, 1
down, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
haste,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
herself, 1
going, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
kitchen., 1
She, 1
cried, 1
out,, 1
but, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
her;, 1
possessed, 1
with, 1
but, 1
one, 1
idea,, 1
he, 1
cleared, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
steps, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bound,, 1
and, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
kitchen,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
decanter, 1
about, 1
three, 1
parts, 1
empty, 1
still, 1
standing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
waiter,, 1
where, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
left., 1
He, 1
darted, 1
upon, 1
it, 1
as, 1
an, 1
eagle, 1
would, 1
seize, 1
upon, 1
its, 1
prey., 1
Panting, 1
with, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
breath,, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
room, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
left., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
slowly, 1
ascending, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
her, 1
room., 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
the, 1
decanter, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
of?", 1
asked, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Yes,, 1
doctor.", 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
the, 1
same, 1
lemonade, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
partook?", 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
so.", 1
"What, 1
did, 1
it, 1
taste, 1
like?", 1
"It, 1
had, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
taste.", 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
poured, 1
some, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lemonade, 1
into, 1
the, 1
palm, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
put, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
rinsed, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
does, 1
when, 1
he, 1
is, 1
tasting, 1
wine,, 1
he, 1
spat, 1
the, 1
liquor, 1
into, 1
the, 1
fireplace., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
the, 1
same,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
drink, 1
some, 1
too,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
did, 1
you, 1
also, 1
discover, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
taste?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Oh,, 1
doctor,", 1
cried, 1
Barrois,, 1
"the, 1
fit, 1
is, 1
coming, 1
on, 1
again., 1
Oh,, 1
do, 1
something, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
flew, 1
to, 1
his, 1
patient., 1
"That, 1
emetic,, 1
Villefort--see, 1
if, 1
it, 1
is, 1
coming.", 1
Villefort, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
exclaiming,, 1
"The, 1
emetic!, 1
the, 1
emetic!--is, 1
it, 1
come, 1
yet?", 1
No, 1
one, 1
answered., 1
The, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
terror, 1
reigned, 1
throughout, 1
the, 1
house., 1
"If, 1
I, 1
had, 1
anything, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
could, 1
inflate, 1
the, 1
lungs,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
looking, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
"perhaps, 1
I, 1
might, 1
prevent, 1
suffocation., 1
But, 1
there, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
which, 1
would, 1
do--nothing!", 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
cried, 1
Barrois,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
let, 1
me, 1
die, 1
without, 1
help?, 1
Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
dying!, 1
Oh,, 1
save, 1
me!", 1
"A, 1
pen,, 1
a, 1
pen!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
There, 1
was, 1
one, 1
lying, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table;, 1
he, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
introduce, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
patient,, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
his, 1
convulsions,, 1
was, 1
making, 1
vain, 1
attempts, 1
to, 1
vomit;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
jaws, 1
were, 1
so, 1
clinched, 1
that, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
could, 1
not, 1
pass, 1
them., 1
This, 1
second, 1
attack, 1
was, 1
much, 1
more, 1
violent, 1
than, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
had, 1
slipped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
couch, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
writhing, 1
in, 1
agony., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
left, 1
him, 1
in, 1
this, 1
paroxysm,, 1
knowing, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
alleviate, 1
it,, 1
and,, 1
going, 1
up, 1
to, 1
Noirtier,, 1
said, 1
abruptly,, 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
find, 1
yourself?--well?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
weight, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chest;, 1
or, 1

light, 1
and, 1
comfortable--eh?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
feel, 1
pretty, 1
much, 1
as, 1
you, 1
generally, 1
do, 1
after, 1
you, 1
have, 1
had, 1
the, 1
dose, 1
which, 1
I, 1

you, 1
every, 1

Barrois, 1
make, 1
your, 1
lemonade?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Was, 1
it, 1
you, 1
who, 1
asked, 1
him, 1
to, 1

some, 1
of, 1
it?", 1

was, 1
it, 1

"Yes.", 1
A, 1
groan, 1
from, 1
Barrois,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
yawn, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
crack, 1
the, 1
very, 1
jawbones,, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny;, 1
he, 1
left, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sick, 1
man., 1
"Barrois,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"can, 1
you, 1
speak?", 1
Barrois, 1
muttered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
unintelligible, 1
words., 1
"Try, 1
and, 1
make, 1
an, 1
effort, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
man.", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
Barrois, 1
reopened, 1
his, 1
bloodshot, 1
eyes., 1
"Who, 1
made, 1
the, 1
lemonade?", 1
"I, 1
did.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
bring, 1
it, 1
to, 1
your, 1
master, 1
directly, 1
it, 1
was, 1
made?", 1
"No.", 1
"You, 1
left, 1
it, 1
somewhere,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
meantime?", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
left, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pantry,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
was, 1
called, 1
away.", 1
"Who, 1
brought, 1
it, 1
into, 1
this, 1
room,, 1
then?", 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
struck, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Gracious, 1
heaven,", 1
exclaimed, 1
he., 1
"Doctor,, 1
doctor!", 1
cried, 1
Barrois,, 1
who, 1
felt, 1
another, 1
fit, 1
coming., 1
"Will, 1
they, 1
never, 1
bring, 1
that, 1
emetic?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
one, 1
already, 1
prepared,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Who, 1
prepared, 1
it?", 1
"The, 1
chemist, 1
who, 1
came, 1
here, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
"Drink, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
to, 1
Barrois., 1
"Impossible,, 1
doctor;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
too, 1
late;, 1
my, 1

Ah,, 1
my, 1

no,, 1

the, 1
doctor,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
cease, 1
to, 1
suffer.", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
man., 1
"My, 1
God,, 1
have, 1
mercy, 1
upon, 1
me!", 1
and,, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
fearful, 1
cry,, 1
Barrois, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
struck, 1
by, 1
lightning., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
put, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
before, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
"Well?", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
kitchen, 1
and, 1
get, 1
me, 1
some, 1
syrup, 1
of, 1
violets.", 1
Villefort, 1
went, 1
immediately., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
take, 1
my, 1
patient, 1
into, 1
the, 1
next, 1
room, 1
to, 1
bleed, 1
him;, 1
this, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
attack, 1

very, 1
frightful, 1
to, 1
witness.", 1
And, 1
taking, 1
Barrois, 1
under, 1
the, 1
arms,, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
him, 1
into, 1
an, 1
adjoining, 1
room;, 1
but, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
the, 1
lemonade., 1
Noirtier, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
right, 1
eye., 1
"You, 1
want, 1
Valentine,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
them, 1
to, 1
send, 1
her, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
Villefort, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
met, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
passage., 1
"Well,, 1
how, 1
is, 1
he, 1
now?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"Come, 1
in, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
took, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
where, 1
the, 1
sick, 1
man, 1
lay., 1
"Is, 1
he, 1
still, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fit?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
dead.", 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
a, 1
few, 1
steps,, 1
and,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
exclaimed,, 1
with, 1
real, 1
amazement, 1
and, 1
sympathy,, 1
"Dead?--and, 1
so, 1
soon, 1
too!", 1
"Yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
soon,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
before, 1
him;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
astonish, 1

People, 1
die, 1
very, 1
suddenly, 1
in, 1
your, 1
house,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"What?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
horror, 1
and, 1
consternation,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
still, 1
harping, 1
on, 1
that, 1
terrible, 1
idea?", 1
"Still,, 1
sir;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
always, 1
do, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"for, 1
it, 1
has, 1

Villefort.", 1
The, 1
magistrate, 1
trembled, 1
convulsively., 1
"There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
poison, 1
which, 1
destroys, 1
life, 1
almost, 1
without, 1
leaving, 1
any, 1
perceptible, 1
traces., 1
I, 1
know, 1
it, 1
well;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
studied, 1
it, 1
in, 1
all, 1
its, 1
forms, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
which, 1
it, 1
produces., 1
I, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
this, 1
poison, 1
in, 1
the, 1
case, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Barrois, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
in, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran., 1
There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
way, 1
of, 1
detecting, 1
its, 1
presence., 1

restores, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
color, 1
of, 1
litmus-paper, 1
reddened, 1
by, 1
an, 1
acid,, 1

have, 1
no, 1

see,, 1
here, 1
they, 1
come, 1
with, 1
the, 1
syrup, 1
of, 1
violets.", 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
was, 1
right;, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
passage., 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chambermaid, 1
a, 1
cup, 1
which, 1
contained, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
spoonfuls, 1
of, 1
the, 1
syrup,, 1
he, 1
then, 1
carefully, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Look,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
whose, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
so, 1
loudly, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
almost, 1
be, 1
heard,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
in, 1
this, 1
cup, 1
some, 1
syrup, 1
of, 1
violets,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
decanter, 1
contains, 1
the, 1
remainder, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lemonade, 1
of, 1
which, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
Barrois, 1
partook., 1

the, 1
lemonade, 1
be, 1
pure, 1
and, 1
inoffensive,, 1
the, 1
syrup, 1
will, 1
retain, 1
its, 1
color;, 1

on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
the, 1
lemonade, 1
be, 1
drugged, 1
with, 1
poison,, 1
the, 1
syrup, 1
will, 1
become, 1
green., 1
Look, 1
closely!", 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
then, 1
slowly, 1
poured, 1
some, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lemonade, 1
from, 1
the, 1
decanter, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cup,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
a, 1
light, 1
cloudy, 1
sediment, 1
began, 1
to, 1
form, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cup;, 1
this, 1
sediment, 1
first, 1
took, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
shade,, 1
then, 1
from, 1
the, 1
color, 1
of, 1
sapphire, 1
it, 1
passed, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
opal,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
opal, 1
to, 1
emerald., 1
Arrived, 1
at, 1
this, 1
last, 1
hue,, 1
it, 1
changed, 1
no, 1
more., 1
The, 1
result, 1
of, 1
the, 1
experiment, 1
left, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
whatever, 1
on, 1
the, 1
mind., 1
"The, 1
unfortunate, 1
Barrois, 1
has, 1
been, 1
poisoned,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
maintain, 1
this, 1
assertion, 1
before, 1
God, 1
and, 1
man.", 1
Villefort, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
clasped, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
haggard, 1
eyes,, 1
and,, 1
overcome, 1
with, 1
his, 1
emotion,, 1
sank, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
Chapter, 1
80., 1
The, 1
Accusation., 1
M., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
soon, 1
restored, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
to, 1
consciousness,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
a, 1
second, 1
corpse, 1
in, 1
that, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
death., 1
"Oh,, 1
death, 1
is, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house!", 1
cried, 1
Villefort., 1
"Say,, 1
rather,, 1
crime!", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
"M., 1
d'Avrigny,", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
tell, 1

all, 1

"Yes,", 1

M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
imposing, 1
calmness,, 1

around, 1

Villefort,, 1
without, 1

had, 1
assembled, 1
in, 1

had, 1
a, 1
long, 1
consultation,, 1
came, 1
to, 1

to, 1

argument, 1
they, 1
replied,, 1
"We, 1
must, 1
go,, 1
for, 1
death, 1

in, 1

house.", 1
They, 1
all, 1
left,, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
prayers, 1

regret, 1
at, 1

it, 1
was,, 1

with, 1

in, 1

fitted, 1

courtyard, 1
of, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
house, 1
in, 1
La, 1
Chaussee, 1
d'Antin., 1
He, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
more, 1
than, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
before, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
Danglars, 1
aside, 1
into, 1
the, 1
recess, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bow-window,, 1
and,, 1
after, 1
an, 1
ingenious, 1
preamble,, 1
related, 1
to, 1
him, 1
all, 1
his, 1
anxieties, 1
and, 1
cares, 1
since, 1
his, 1
noble, 1

He, 1
acknowledged, 1
the, 1
extreme, 1
kindness, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
shown, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
family,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
received, 1
as, 1
a, 1
son,, 1
and, 1
where,, 1
besides,, 1
his, 1
warmest, 1
affections, 1
had, 1
found, 1
an, 1
object, 1
on, 1
which, 1
to, 1
centre, 1
in, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars., 1
Danglars, 1
listened, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
attention;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
expected, 1
this, 1
declaration, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
days,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
at, 1
last, 1
it, 1
came, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
glistened, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
they, 1
had, 1
lowered, 1
on, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
Morcerf., 1
He, 1
would, 1
not,, 1
however,, 1
yield, 1
immediately, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
request,, 1
but, 1
made, 1
a, 1
few, 1
conscientious, 1
objections., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
rather, 1
young,, 1
M., 1
Andrea,, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
marrying?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
not,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti;, 1
"in, 1
Italy, 1
the, 1
nobility, 1
generally, 1

young., 1
Life, 1
is, 1
so, 1
uncertain,, 1
that, 1
we, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
happiness, 1
while, 1
it, 1
is, 1
within, 1
our, 1
reach.", 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"in, 1
case, 1
your, 1
proposals,, 1
which, 1
do, 1
me, 1
honor,, 1
are, 1
accepted, 1
by, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
daughter,, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
shall, 1
the, 1
preliminary, 1
arrangements, 1
be, 1
settled?, 1
So, 1
important, 1
a, 1
negotiation, 1
should,, 1
I, 1
think,, 1
be, 1
conducted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
respective, 1
fathers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
people.", 1
"Sir,, 1
my, 1
father, 1
is, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
great, 1
foresight, 1
and, 1
prudence., 1
Thinking, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
settle, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
me, 1
at, 1
his, 1
departure,, 1
together, 1
with, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
establishing, 1
my, 1
identity,, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
promising,, 1

livres, 1
per, 1
annum, 1
from, 1
the, 1
day, 1
I, 1
was, 1

So, 1
far, 1
as, 1
I, 1
can, 1
judge,, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
this, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
revenue.", 1
"I,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"have, 1
always, 1
intended, 1
giving, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
500,000, 1
francs, 1
as, 1
her, 1
dowry;, 1
she, 1
is,, 1
besides,, 1
my, 1
sole, 1
heiress.", 1
"All, 1
would, 1
then, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
arranged, 1
if, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
are, 1
willing., 1
We, 1
should, 1
command, 1
an, 1
annuity, 1
of, 1
175,000, 1
livres., 1
Supposing,, 1
also,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
persuade, 1
the, 1
marquis, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
my, 1
capital,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
not, 1
likely,, 1
but, 1
still, 1
is, 1
possible,, 1
we, 1
would, 1
place, 1
these, 1
two, 1

three, 1
millions, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hands,, 1
whose, 1
talent, 1
might, 1

it, 1
realize, 1
ten, 1
per, 1

"I, 1
never, 1
give, 1
more, 1
than, 1
four, 1
per, 1
cent,, 1
and, 1
generally, 1
only, 1
three, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half;, 1

to, 1
my, 1
son-in-law, 1
I, 1
would, 1
give, 1
five,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
would, 1
share, 1
the, 1
profit.", 1
"Very, 1
good,, 1
father-in-law,", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
his, 1
low-born, 1
nature,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
escape, 1
sometimes, 1
through, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
gloss, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
it., 1
Correcting, 1
himself, 1
immediately,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
sir;, 1
hope, 1
alone, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
almost, 1
mad,--what, 1
will, 1
not, 1
reality, 1
do?", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,--who,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
part,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
perceive, 1
how, 1
soon, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
at, 1
first, 1
disinterested,, 1
was, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
a, 1
business, 1
transaction,--"there, 1
is,, 1
doubtless,, 1
a, 1
part, 1
of, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
your, 1
father, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refuse, 1
you?", 1
"Which?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"That, 1
you, 1
inherit, 1
from, 1
your, 1
mother.", 1
"Truly,, 1
from, 1
my, 1
mother,, 1
Leonora, 1
Corsinari.", 1
"How, 1
much, 1
may, 1
it, 1
amount, 1
to?", 1
"Indeed,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
given, 1
the, 1
subject, 1
a, 1
thought,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
suppose, 1
it, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
at, 1
least, 1
two, 1
millions.", 1
Danglars, 1
felt, 1
as, 1
much, 1
overcome, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
as, 1
the, 1
miser, 1
who, 1
finds, 1
a, 1
lost, 1
treasure,, 1
or, 1
as, 1
the, 1
shipwrecked, 1
mariner, 1
who, 1
feels, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
solid, 1
ground, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
in, 1
the, 1
abyss, 1
which, 1
he, 1
expected, 1
would, 1
swallow, 1
him, 1
up., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
bowing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
respectfully,, 1
"may, 1
I, 1
hope?", 1
"You, 1
may, 1
not, 1
only, 1
hope,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"but, 1
consider, 1
it, 1
a, 1
settled, 1
thing,, 1
if, 1
no, 1
obstacle, 1
arises, 1
on, 1
your, 1
part.", 1
"I, 1
am,, 1
indeed,, 1
rejoiced,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
thoughtfully,, 1
"how, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
your, 1
patron,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
did, 1
not, 1
make, 1
his, 1
proposal, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
Andrea, 1
blushed, 1
imperceptibly., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
left, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"he, 1
is,, 1
doubtless,, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
man, 1
but, 1
inconceivably, 1
peculiar, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ideas., 1
He, 1
esteems, 1
me, 1
highly., 1
He, 1
even, 1
told, 1
me, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
my, 1
father, 1
would, 1
give, 1
me, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
of, 1
my, 1
property., 1
He, 1
has, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
use, 1
his, 1
influence, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
it, 1
for, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
also, 1
declared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
never, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
on, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
responsibility, 1
of, 1
making, 1
proposals, 1
for, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
never, 1
would., 1
I, 1
must,, 1
however,, 1
do, 1
him, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
to, 1
add, 1
that, 1
he, 1
assured, 1
me, 1
if, 1
ever, 1
he, 1
had, 1
regretted, 1
the, 1
repugnance, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
step, 1
it, 1
was, 1
on, 1
this, 1
occasion,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
projected, 1
union, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
happy, 1
and, 1
suitable, 1
one., 1
Besides,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
will, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
officially,, 1
he, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
any, 1
questions, 1
you, 1
propose, 1
to, 1
him., 1
And, 1
now,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
most, 1
charming, 1
smiles,, 1
"having, 1
finished, 1
talking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
father-in-law,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
address, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
may, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
laughing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn., 1
"That, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after, 1
to-morrow, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
upon, 1
you, 1
for, 1
about, 1
four, 1
thousand, 1
francs;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
expecting, 1
my, 1
bachelor's, 1
revenue, 1
could, 1
not, 1
suffice, 1
for, 1
the, 1
coming, 1
month's, 1
outlay,, 1
has, 1
offered, 1
me, 1
a, 1
draft, 1
for, 1
twenty, 1
thousand, 1
francs., 1
It, 1
bears, 1
his, 1
signature,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
all-sufficient.", 1
"Bring, 1
me, 1
a, 1
million, 1
such, 1
as, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
well, 1
pleased,", 1
putting, 1
the, 1
draft, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket., 1
"Fix, 1
your, 1
own, 1
hour, 1
for, 1
to-morrow,, 1

my, 1
cashier, 1
shall, 1
call, 1
on, 1
you, 1
with, 1
a, 1
check, 1
for, 1
eighty, 1
thousand, 1
francs.", 1
"At, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
it, 1
early,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
into, 1
the, 1
country, 1
to-morrow.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
still, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
des, 1
Princes?", 1
"Yes.", 1
The, 1
following, 1
morning,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
usual, 1
punctuality,, 1
the, 1
eighty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
hands, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
starting,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
left, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
Caderousse., 1
He, 1
went, 1
out, 1
chiefly, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
this, 1
dangerous, 1
enemy,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
as, 1
late, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening., 1
But, 1
scarcely, 1
had, 1
he, 1
stepped, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
when, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
met, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
parcel, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"that, 1
man, 1
has, 1
been, 1
here.", 1
"What, 1
man?", 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
carelessly,, 1
apparently, 1
forgetting, 1
him, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
but, 1
too, 1
well, 1
recollected., 1
"Him, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
pays, 1
that, 1
little, 1
annuity.", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"my, 1
father's, 1
old, 1
servant., 1
Well,, 1
you, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
the, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
I, 1
had, 1
left, 1
for, 1
him?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
thus, 1
addressed., 1
"But,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
porter,, 1
"he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
take, 1
them.", 1
Andrea, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
dark, 1
his, 1
pallor, 1
was, 1
not, 1
perceptible., 1
"What?, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
take, 1
them?", 1
said, 1
he, 1
with, 1
slight, 1
emotion., 1
"No,, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
your, 1
excellency;, 1
I, 1
told, 1
him, 1
you, 1
were, 1
gone, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
some, 1
dispute, 1
he, 1
believed, 1
me, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
this, 1
letter,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
with, 1
him, 1
already, 1
sealed.", 1
"Give, 1
it, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
read, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carriage-lamp,--"You, 1
know, 1
where, 1
I, 1
live;, 1
I, 1
expect, 1
you, 1
tomorrow, 1
morning, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock.", 1
Andrea, 1
examined, 1
it, 1
carefully,, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
if, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
had, 1
been, 1
opened,, 1
or, 1
if, 1
any, 1
indiscreet, 1
eyes, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
its, 1
contents;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
so, 1
carefully, 1
folded,, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
have, 1
read, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
seal, 1
was, 1
perfect., 1
"Very, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Poor, 1
man,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
worthy, 1
creature.", 1
He, 1
left, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
to, 1
ponder, 1
on, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
not, 1
knowing, 1
which, 1
most, 1
to, 1
admire,, 1
the, 1
master, 1
or, 1
the, 1
servant., 1
"Take, 1
out, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
quickly,, 1
and, 1
come, 1
up, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
to, 1
his, 1
groom., 1
In, 1
two, 1
seconds, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
his, 1
room, 1
and, 1
burnt, 1
Caderousse's, 1
letter., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
entered, 1
just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
finished., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
about, 1
my, 1
height,, 1
Pierre,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
that, 1
honor,, 1
your, 1
excellency.", 1
"You, 1
had, 1
a, 1
new, 1
livery, 1
yesterday?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
an, 1
engagement, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
little, 1
girl, 1
for, 1
this, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
known;, 1
lend, 1
me, 1
your, 1
livery, 1
till, 1
to-morrow., 1
I, 1
may, 1
sleep,, 1
perhaps,, 1
at, 1
an, 1
inn.", 1
Pierre, 1
obeyed., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
after,, 1
Andrea, 1
left, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
completely, 1
disguised,, 1
took, 1
a, 1
cabriolet,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
driver, 1
to, 1
take, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Cheval, 1
Rouge,, 1
at, 1
Picpus., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
he, 1
left, 1
that, 1
inn, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
des, 1
Princes,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
noticed,, 1
walked, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Antoine,, 1
along, 1
the, 1
boulevard, 1
to, 1
Rue, 1
Menilmontant,, 1
and, 1
stopping, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
third, 1
house, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left, 1
looked, 1
for, 1
some, 1
one, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
to, 1
make, 1
inquiry, 1
in, 1
the, 1
porter's, 1
absence., 1
"For, 1
whom, 1
are, 1
you, 1
looking,, 1
my, 1
fine, 1
fellow?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
fruiteress, 1
on, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side., 1
"Monsieur, 1
Pailletin,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
woman,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea., 1
"A, 1
retired, 1
baker?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
fruiteress., 1
"Exactly.", 1
"He, 1
lives, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yard,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third, 1
story.", 1
Andrea, 1
went, 1
as, 1
she, 1
directed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
third, 1
floor, 1
he, 1
found, 1
a, 1
hare's, 1
paw,, 1
which,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hasty, 1
ringing, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
he, 1
pulled, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
ill-temper., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
after, 1
Caderousse's, 1
face, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
grating, 1
in, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
punctual,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Confound, 1
you, 1
and, 1
your, 1
punctuality!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
throwing, 1
himself, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
which, 1
implied, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
have, 1
flung, 1
it, 1
at, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
his, 1
host., 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
my, 1
little, 1
fellow,, 1
don't, 1
be, 1
angry., 1
See,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
about, 1
you--look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
good, 1
breakfast, 1
we, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
have;, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
what, 1
you, 1
are, 1
fond, 1
of.", 1
Andrea,, 1
indeed,, 1
inhaled, 1
the, 1
scent, 1
of, 1
something, 1
cooking, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
unwelcome, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
hungry, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
mixture, 1
of, 1
fat, 1
and, 1
garlic, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
provincial, 1
kitchens, 1
of, 1
an, 1
inferior, 1
order,, 1
added, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
dried, 1
fish,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
all,, 1
the, 1
pungent, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
musk, 1
and, 1
cloves., 1
These, 1
odors, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
two, 1
deep, 1
dishes, 1
which, 1
were, 1
covered, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
stove,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
a, 1
copper, 1
pan, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
an, 1
old, 1
iron, 1
pot., 1
In, 1
an, 1
adjoining, 1
room, 1
Andrea, 1
saw, 1
also, 1
a, 1
tolerably, 1
clean, 1
table, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
two,, 1
two, 1
bottles, 1
of, 1
wine, 1
sealed,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
with, 1
green,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
with, 1
yellow,, 1
a, 1
supply, 1
of, 1
brandy, 1
in, 1
a, 1
decanter,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
measure, 1
of, 1
fruit, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cabbage-leaf,, 1
cleverly, 1
arranged, 1
on, 1
an, 1
earthenware, 1
plate., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
little, 1
fellow?", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Ay,, 1
that, 1
smells, 1
good!, 1
You, 1
know, 1
I, 1
used, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
famous, 1
cook;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
recollect, 1
how, 1
you, 1
used, 1
to, 1
lick, 1
your, 1
fingers?, 1
You, 1
were, 1
among, 1
the, 1
first, 1
who, 1
tasted, 1
any, 1
of, 1
my, 1
dishes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
relished, 1
them, 1
tolerably.", 1
While, 1
speaking,, 1
Caderousse, 1
went, 1
on, 1
peeling, 1
a, 1
fresh, 1
supply, 1
of, 1
onions., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
ill-temperedly,, 1
"by, 1
my, 1
faith,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
to, 1
breakfast, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
disturbed, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
you!", 1
"My, 1
boy,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
sententiously,, 1
"one, 1
can, 1
talk, 1
while, 1
eating., 1
And, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
ungrateful, 1
being,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
see, 1
an, 1
old, 1
friend?, 1
I, 1
am, 1
weeping, 1
with, 1
joy.", 1
He, 1
was, 1
truly, 1
crying,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
say, 1
whether, 1
joy, 1
or, 1
the, 1
onions, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
the, 1
lachrymal, 1
glands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
inn-keeper, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Pont-du-Gard., 1
"Hold, 1
your, 1
tongue,, 1
hypocrite,", 1
said, 1
Andrea;, 1
"you, 1
love, 1
me!", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
do,, 1
or, 1
may, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
take, 1
me., 1
I, 1
know, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
weakness,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"but, 1
it, 1
overpowers, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
it, 1
has, 1
not, 1
prevented, 1
your, 1
sending, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
play, 1
me, 1
some, 1
trick.", 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
wiping, 1
his, 1
large, 1
knife, 1
on, 1
his, 1
apron,, 1
"if, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
I, 1
should, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
life, 1
you, 1
lead, 1
me?, 1
Think, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
You, 1
have, 1
your, 1
servant's, 1
clothes, 1
on--you, 1
therefore, 1
keep, 1
a, 1
servant;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
none,, 1
and, 1
am, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
my, 1
own, 1
meals., 1
You, 1
abuse, 1
my, 1
cookery, 1
because, 1
you, 1
dine, 1
at, 1
the, 1
table, 1
d'hote, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
des, 1
Princes,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1
Paris., 1
Well,, 1
I, 1
too, 1
could, 1
keep, 1
a, 1
servant;, 1
I, 1
too, 1
could, 1
have, 1
a, 1
tilbury;, 1
I, 1
too, 1
could, 1
dine, 1
where, 1
I, 1
like;, 1
but, 1
why, 1
do, 1
I, 1
not?, 1
Because, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
annoy, 1
my, 1
little, 1
Benedetto., 1
Come,, 1
just, 1
acknowledge, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could,, 1
eh?", 1
This, 1
address, 1
was, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
look, 1
which, 1
was, 1
by, 1
no, 1
means, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
understand., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"admitting, 1
your, 1
love,, 1
why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
me, 1
to, 1
breakfast, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"That, 1
I, 1
may, 1
have, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
little, 1
fellow.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
me, 1
after, 1
we, 1
have, 1
made, 1
all, 1
our, 1
arrangements?", 1
"Eh,, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"are, 1
wills, 1
ever, 1
made, 1
without, 1
codicils?, 1
But, 1
you, 1
first, 1
came, 1
to, 1
breakfast,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
Well,, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
us, 1
begin, 1
with, 1
these, 1
pilchards,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
fresh, 1
butter;, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
put, 1
on, 1
some, 1
vine-leaves, 1
to, 1
please, 1
you,, 1
wicked, 1
one., 1
Ah,, 1
yes;, 1
you, 1
look, 1
at, 1
my, 1
room,, 1
my, 1
four, 1
straw, 1
chairs,, 1
my, 1
images,, 1
three, 1
francs, 1
each., 1
But, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
expect?, 1
This, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
des, 1
Princes.", 1
"Come,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
growing, 1
discontented,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
happy;, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
only, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
live, 1
like, 1
a, 1
retired, 1
baker.", 1
Caderousse, 1
sighed., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
to, 1
say?, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
your, 1
dream, 1
realized.", 1
"I, 1
can, 1
still, 1
say, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
dream;, 1
a, 1
retired, 1
baker,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
Benedetto,, 1
is, 1
rich--he, 1
has, 1
an, 1
annuity.", 1
"Well,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
an, 1
annuity.", 1
"I, 1
have?", 1
"Yes,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
bring, 1
you, 1
your, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs.", 1
Caderousse, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
humiliating,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"thus, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
money, 1
given, 1
grudgingly,--an, 1
uncertain, 1
supply, 1
which, 1
may, 1
soon, 1
fail., 1
You, 1
see, 1
I, 1
am, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
economize,, 1
in, 1
case, 1
your, 1
prosperity, 1
should, 1
cease., 1
Well,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
inconstant,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
chaplain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
regiment, 1
said., 1
I, 1
know, 1
your, 1
prosperity, 1
is, 1
great,, 1
you, 1
rascal;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
Danglars.", 1
"What?, 1
of, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Yes,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sure;, 1
must, 1
I, 1
say, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars?, 1
I, 1
might, 1
as, 1
well, 1
say, 1
Count, 1
Benedetto., 1
He, 1
was, 1
an, 1
old, 1
friend, 1

if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
so, 1
bad, 1
a, 1
memory, 1
he, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
invite, 1
me, 1
to, 1
your, 1
wedding,, 1
seeing, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
mine., 1
Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
to, 1
mine;, 1
gad,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
not, 1
so, 1
proud, 1
then,--he, 1
was, 1
an, 1
under-clerk, 1
to, 1
the, 1
good, 1
M., 1
Morrel., 1
I, 1
have, 1
dined, 1
many, 1
times, 1
with, 1
him, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
so, 1
you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
have, 1
some, 1
high, 1
connections, 1
and, 1
were, 1
I, 1

"That, 1
is, 1
all, 1
very, 1
fine,, 1
Benedetto, 1
mio,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
saying., 1
Perhaps, 1
I, 1
may, 1
one, 1
day, 1
put, 1
on, 1
my, 1
best, 1
coat,, 1
and, 1
presenting, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
great, 1
gate,, 1
introduce, 1
myself., 1

let, 1
us, 1
sit, 1
down, 1
and, 1
eat.", 1
Caderousse, 1
set, 1
the, 1
example, 1
and, 1
attacked, 1
the, 1
breakfast, 1
with, 1
good, 1
appetite,, 1
praising, 1
each, 1
dish, 1
he, 1
set, 1
before, 1
his, 1
visitor., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
resigned, 1
himself;, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
corks,, 1
and, 1
partook, 1
largely, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fish, 1
with, 1
the, 1
garlic, 1
and, 1
fat., 1
"Ah,, 1
mate,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
getting, 1
on, 1
better, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
your, 1
old, 1
landlord!", 1
"Faith,, 1
yes,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea,, 1
whose, 1
hunger, 1
prevailed, 1
over, 1
every, 1
other, 1
feeling., 1
"So, 1
you, 1
like, 1
it,, 1
you, 1
rogue?", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
that, 1
I, 1
wonder, 1
how, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
can, 1
cook, 1
thus, 1
can, 1
complain, 1
of, 1
hard, 1
living.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"all, 1
my, 1
happiness, 1
is, 1
marred, 1
by, 1
one, 1
thought?", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
"That, 1
I, 1
am, 1
dependent, 1
on, 1
another,, 1
I, 1
who, 1
have, 1
always, 1
gained, 1
my, 1
own, 1
livelihood, 1
honestly.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
that, 1
disturb, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
two.", 1
"No,, 1

you, 1
will;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1

am, 1
tormented, 1
by, 1
remorse.", 1
"Good, 1
Caderousse!", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
so,, 1
that, 1
yesterday, 1
I, 1
would, 1
not, 1
take, 1
the, 1
two, 1
hundred, 1
francs.", 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
was, 1
it, 1
indeed, 1
remorse,, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
"True, 1
remorse;, 1

besides,, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
me.", 1
Andrea, 1
shuddered;, 1
he, 1
always, 1
did, 1
so, 1
at, 1
Caderousse's, 1
ideas., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
miserable--do, 1
you, 1
see?--always, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
till, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month."--"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
philosophically,, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
narrowly,, 1
"does, 1
not, 1
life, 1
pass, 1
in, 1
waiting?, 1

better?, 1

I, 1
wait, 1
patiently,, 1

I, 1
not?", 1
"Yes;, 1
because, 1
instead, 1
of, 1

two, 1

expect, 1
five, 1

ten,, 1

twelve,, 1

any, 1
one, 1
know, 1

Down, 1
there,, 1

presents, 1
and, 1
Christmas-boxes, 1

you, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
hide, 1
from, 1
your, 1

friend, 1

is, 1

cunning, 1
fellow,, 1
that, 1
friend, 1

"There, 1
you, 1
are, 1

again, 1
to, 1
ramble,, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
again, 1

again, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past!, 1

what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
use, 1
of, 1

Andrea,, 1
"that, 1
isn't, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
idea.", 1

Andrea,, 1
"how, 1
covetous, 1
you, 1
are!, 1
Two, 1

off, 1

of, 1
bread,, 1
"I, 1

plan.", 1
Caderousse's, 1
plans, 1
alarmed, 1
Andrea, 1
still, 1
more, 1
than, 1
his, 1
ideas;, 1
ideas, 1
were, 1

the, 1

was, 1
reality., 1

me, 1

your, 1
plan;, 1

a, 1
pretty, 1
one.", 1

formed, 1

out, 1

Andrea, 1
did, 1
more, 1
than, 1
tremble, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
pale., 1
"Come,, 1
Caderousse,, 1
no, 1
nonsense!", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Don't, 1
alarm, 1

point, 1
out, 1

advantage"--, 1
"Bah,", 1

Caderousse,, 1
"when, 1

stores.", 1
One, 1
would, 1
have, 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
anticipated, 1
his, 1
companion's, 1
words,, 1
so, 1
did, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
flash, 1
like, 1
lightning,, 1

it, 1
was, 1
but, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"True,", 1

my, 1
protector, 1
is, 1

kind.", 1
"That, 1
dear, 1
protector,", 1

Caderousse;, 1
"and, 1
how, 1
much, 1
does, 1
he, 1
give, 1
you, 1

"Five, 1
thousand, 1

fortunate., 1

you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
all, 1

to, 1
you--your, 1

unfortunately, 1

must, 1

"You, 1
must, 1
wait, 1
for, 1

Caderousse., 1
"For, 1
his, 1
death.", 1
"The, 1
death, 1
of, 1
your, 1
prince?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1

little, 1
enough.", 1

that, 1

is, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1

Caderousse,, 1
twirling, 1
a, 1
plate, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air, 1
between, 1
his, 1
two, 1
hands., 1
"Now, 1
say, 1
if, 1
I, 1
conceal, 1
anything, 1
from, 1
you?", 1
"No,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
confidence, 1
makes, 1
you, 1
honorable, 1
in, 1
my, 1
opinion;, 1
and, 1
your, 1
princely, 1
father,, 1
is, 1
he, 1
rich,, 1
very, 1
rich?", 1
"Yes,, 1
he, 1
is, 1
that;, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
himself, 1
know, 1
the, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
possible?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
evident, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
am, 1
always, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house., 1
The, 1
other, 1
day, 1
a, 1
banker's, 1
clerk, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
a, 1
portfolio, 1
about, 1
the, 1
size, 1
of, 1
your, 1
plate;, 1
yesterday, 1
his, 1
banker, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
gold.", 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
wonder;, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
words, 1
sounded, 1
to, 1
him, 1
like, 1
metal,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
could, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
rushing, 1
of, 1
cascades, 1
of, 1
louis., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
go, 1
into, 1
that, 1
house?", 1
cried, 1
he, 1
briskly., 1
"When, 1
I, 1
like.", 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
thoughtful, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
It, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
he, 1
was, 1
revolving, 1
some, 1
unfortunate, 1
idea, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
Then, 1
suddenly,--"How, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
to, 1
see, 1
all, 1
that,", 1
cried, 1
he;, 1
"how, 1
beautiful, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be!", 1
"It, 1
is,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
magnificent,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"And, 1
does, 1
he, 1
not, 1
live, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs-Elysees?", 1
"Yes,, 1
No., 1
30.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"No., 1
30.", 1
"Yes,, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
house, 1
standing, 1
alone,, 1
between, 1
a, 1
court-yard, 1
and, 1
a, 1
garden,--you, 1
must, 1
know, 1
it.", 1
"Possibly;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
exterior, 1

care, 1
for,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1

What, 1
beautiful, 1
furniture, 1
there, 1
must, 1
be, 1
in, 1
it!", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
Tuileries?", 1
"No.", 1
"Well,, 1
it, 1
surpasses, 1
that.", 1
"It, 1
must, 1
be, 1
worth, 1
one's, 1
while, 1
to, 1
stoop,, 1
Andrea,, 1
when, 1
that, 1
good, 1
M., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
lets, 1
fall, 1
his, 1
purse.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
worth, 1
while, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Andrea;, 1
"money, 1
is, 1
as, 1
plentiful, 1
in, 1
that, 1
house, 1
as, 1
fruit, 1
in, 1
an, 1
orchard.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
should, 1
take, 1
me, 1
there, 1
one, 1
day, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I?, 1
On, 1
what, 1
plea?", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
have, 1
made, 1
my, 1
mouth, 1
water., 1
I, 1
must, 1
absolutely, 1
see, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
a, 1
way.", 1
"No, 1
nonsense,, 1
Caderousse!", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
offer, 1
myself, 1
as, 1
floor-polisher.", 1
"The, 1
rooms, 1
are, 1
all, 1
carpeted.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
contented, 1
to, 1
imagine, 1
it.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
the, 1
best, 1
plan,, 1
believe, 1
me.", 1
"Try,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I?", 1
"Nothing, 1
is, 1
easier., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
large?", 1
"Middling.", 1
"How, 1
is, 1
it, 1
arranged?", 1
"Faith,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
require, 1
pen,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
plan.", 1
"They, 1
are, 1
all, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
briskly., 1
He, 1
fetched, 1
from, 1
an, 1
old, 1
secretary, 1
a, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
white, 1
paper, 1
and, 1
pen, 1
and, 1
ink., 1
"Here,", 1

Caderousse,, 1
"draw, 1
me, 1
all, 1
that, 1
on, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
my, 1
boy.", 1
Andrea, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
with, 1
an, 1
imperceptible, 1
smile, 1
and, 1
began., 1
"The, 1
house,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
said,, 1
is, 1
between, 1
the, 1
court, 1
and, 1
the, 1
garden;, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
see?", 1
Andrea, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
the, 1
court, 1
and, 1
the, 1
house., 1
"High, 1
walls?", 1
"Not, 1
more, 1
than, 1
eight, 1
or, 1
ten, 1
feet.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
not, 1
prudent,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
court, 1
are, 1
orange-trees, 1
in, 1
pots,, 1
turf,, 1

of, 1
flowers.", 1
"And, 1
no, 1
steel-traps?", 1
"No.", 1
"The, 1
stables?", 1
"Are, 1
on, 1
either, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gate,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
see, 1
there.", 1
And, 1
Andrea, 1
continued, 1
his, 1
plan., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
see, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
floor,", 1

Caderousse., 1
"On, 1
the, 1
ground-floor,, 1
dining-room,, 1

drawing-rooms,, 1
billiard-room,, 1
staircase, 1

hall,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
little, 1
back, 1
staircase.", 1
"Windows?", 1
"Magnificent, 1
windows,, 1
so, 1
beautiful,, 1
so, 1
large,, 1
that, 1
I, 1

a, 1
man, 1

should, 1
pass, 1
through, 1

frame.", 1
"Why, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
have, 1
they, 1
any, 1
stairs, 1
with, 1
such, 1
windows?", 1
"Luxury, 1
has, 1
everything.", 1
"But, 1
shutters?", 1
"Yes,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
are, 1
never, 1

That, 1
Count, 1
of, 1

"And, 1
where, 1
do, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
sleep?", 1
"Oh,, 1
they, 1
have, 1
a, 1
house, 1
to, 1
themselves., 1
Picture, 1
to, 1
yourself, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
coach-house, 1
at, 1
the, 1

Well,, 1
over, 1

"Ah,, 1
diable--bells, 1
did, 1
you, 1
say?", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"Oh,, 1
nothing!, 1
I, 1
only, 1

"Yes.", 1

yesterday,, 1

day, 1

it?", 1

"That, 1
is, 1
very, 1

in, 1

here, 1

one, 1
there.", 1

sketched, 1
two, 1
windows, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room,, 1

formed, 1
an, 1
angle, 1
on, 1

appeared, 1

square, 1

to, 1
the, 1
rectangle, 1
of, 1
the, 1

Caderousse, 1
became, 1
thoughtful., 1
"Does, 1
he, 1
often, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Auteuil?", 1
added, 1
he., 1
"Two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times, 1

is, 1
going, 1

day, 1

there.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
"He, 1
has, 1
invited, 1
me, 1
to, 1
dine, 1
there.", 1
"There's, 1
a, 1
life, 1
for, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"a, 1
town, 1
house, 1
and, 1
a, 1
country, 1
house.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
rich.", 1

shall, 1
you, 1
dine, 1
there?", 1
"Probably.", 1
"When, 1
you, 1
dine, 1
there,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
sleep, 1
there?", 1
"If, 1
I, 1
like;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
home, 1
there.", 1
Caderousse, 1
looked, 1
at, 1

young, 1
man,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
get, 1
at, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
But, 1
Andrea, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
cigar-case, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
took, 1
a, 1
Havana,, 1
quietly, 1
lit, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
smoking., 1
"When, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want, 1
your, 1
twelve, 1
hundred, 1
francs?", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Caderousse., 1
"Now,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
them.", 1
Andrea, 1
took, 1
five, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
louis, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket., 1
"Yellow, 1
boys?", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"no,, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
despise, 1
them.", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
esteem, 1
them,, 1

will, 1
not, 1

them.", 1
"You, 1
can, 1
change, 1
them,, 1

gold, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
five, 1
sous.", 1
"Exactly;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
who, 1
changes, 1
them, 1
will, 1
follow, 1
friend, 1
Caderousse,, 1
lay, 1
hands, 1
on, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
demand, 1
what, 1
farmers, 1
pay, 1
him, 1
their, 1
rent, 1
in, 1
gold., 1
No, 1

my, 1
good, 1
fellow;, 1
silver, 1
simply,, 1
round, 1
coins, 1
with, 1

may, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
five-franc, 1
piece.", 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
I, 1
carry, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
francs, 1
about, 1
with, 1
me?, 1
I, 1
should, 1
want, 1
a, 1
porter.", 1
"Well,, 1
leave, 1
them, 1
with, 1
your, 1
porter;, 1

is, 1
to, 1
be, 1

will, 1
call, 1
for, 1

"To-day?", 1
"No,, 1
to-morrow;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
have, 1
time, 1
to, 1
day.", 1
"Well,, 1
to-morrow, 1
I, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
them, 1
when, 1
I, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Auteuil.", 1
"May, 1
I, 1
depend, 1
on, 1
it?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"Because, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
secure, 1
my, 1
housekeeper, 1
on, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Now, 1
see, 1
here,, 1
will, 1
that, 1
be, 1
all?, 1
Eh?, 1
And, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not, 1
torment, 1
me, 1
any, 1
more?", 1
"Never.", 1
Caderousse, 1
had, 1
become, 1
so, 1
gloomy, 1
that, 1
Andrea, 1
feared, 1
he, 1
should, 1
be, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
change., 1
He, 1
redoubled, 1
his, 1
gayety, 1
and, 1
carelessness., 1
"How, 1
sprightly, 1
you, 1
are,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"One, 1
would, 1
say, 1
you, 1
were, 1
already, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
your, 1
property.", 1
"No,, 1
unfortunately;, 1

when, 1
I, 1
do, 1
obtain, 1
it"--, 1
"Well?", 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
remember, 1

can, 1
tell, 1
you, 1

you, 1
want?, 1
It, 1
looks, 1
as, 1

trying, 1
to, 1
fleece, 1
me?", 1
"I?, 1
What, 1
an, 1
idea!, 1
I,, 1

it?", 1

Andrea., 1
"How?, 1

on, 1

livery,, 1
you, 1

yourself, 1

well, 1

of, 1

Andrea,, 1
who,, 1
without, 1
becoming, 1
angry,, 1
as, 1
Caderousse, 1
feared,, 1
at, 1
this, 1
new, 1
extortion,, 1
quietly, 1
resigned, 1
the, 1
ring., 1
Caderousse, 1
looked, 1
so, 1
closely, 1
at, 1
it, 1
that, 1
Andrea, 1
well, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
examining, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
all, 1
the, 1
edges, 1
were, 1
perfect., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
false, 1
diamond,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
joking, 1
now,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
angry,, 1
we, 1
can, 1
try, 1
it.", 1
Caderousse, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
it, 1
would, 1
cut., 1
"Confiteor,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
putting, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
on, 1
his, 1
little, 1
finger;, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
mistaken;, 1

those, 1
thieves, 1
of, 1

is, 1
no, 1

is, 1
another, 1
branch, 1
of, 1
industry, 1
paralyzed.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
finished?", 1
said, 1
Andrea,--"do, 1
you, 1

anything, 1
more?--will, 1

"Not, 1

the, 1
young, 1

has, 1
she?", 1
"But, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you"--, 1
"A, 1
million?", 1
Andrea, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"Let, 1
it, 1
be, 1
a, 1
million,", 1

Caderousse;, 1
"you, 1
can, 1
never, 1

so, 1
much, 1

"Oh,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
it, 1
you, 1
with, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart!", 1
added, 1
Caderousse, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hoarse, 1
laugh., 1
"Stop,, 1

me, 1
show, 1
you, 1
the, 1
way.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
worth, 1
while.", 1
"Yes,, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"Why?", 1
"Because, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
little, 1
secret,, 1
a, 1
precaution, 1

thought, 1

Andrea;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1

you, 1
know, 1
a, 1

They, 1
parted., 1
Caderousse, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
the, 1
landing, 1
until, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1

down, 1

three, 1
stories,, 1

also, 1
cross, 1

Then, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
hastily,, 1
shut, 1
his, 1
door, 1
carefully,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
study,, 1
like, 1
a, 1

architect,, 1

The, 1
Burglary., 1
The, 1
day, 1
following, 1
that, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
we, 1
have, 1
related, 1
took, 1
place,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1

set, 1
out, 1
for, 1
Auteuil,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Ali, 1
and, 1
several, 1
attendants,, 1
and, 1
also, 1
taking, 1
with, 1
him, 1
some, 1
horses, 1
whose, 1
qualities, 1
he, 1
was, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
ascertaining., 1
He, 1
was, 1
induced, 1
to, 1
undertake, 1
this, 1
journey,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
even, 1
thought, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
not, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
Andrea, 1
either,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
Bertuccio, 1
from, 1
Normandy, 1
with, 1
intelligence, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
house, 1
and, 1
sloop., 1
The, 1
house, 1
was, 1
ready,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sloop, 1
which, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
a, 1
week, 1
before, 1
lay, 1
at, 1
anchor, 1
in, 1
a, 1
small, 1
creek, 1
with, 1
her, 1
crew, 1
of, 1
six, 1
men,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
observed, 1
all, 1
the, 1
requisite, 1
formalities, 1
and, 1
were, 1
ready, 1
again, 1
to, 1
put, 1
to, 1
sea., 1
The, 1
count, 1
praised, 1
Bertuccio's, 1
zeal,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
for, 1
a, 1
speedy, 1
departure,, 1
as, 1
his, 1
stay, 1
in, 1
France, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
prolonged, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
month., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
may, 1
require, 1
to, 1
go, 1
in, 1
one, 1
night, 1
from, 1
Paris, 1
to, 1
Treport;, 1
let, 1
eight, 1
fresh, 1
horses, 1
be, 1
in, 1
readiness, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
which, 1
will, 1
enable, 1
me, 1
to, 1
go, 1
fifty, 1
leagues, 1
in, 1
ten, 1
hours.", 1
"Your, 1
highness, 1
had, 1
already, 1
expressed, 1
that, 1
wish,", 1
said, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
"and, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
are, 1
ready., 1
I, 1
have, 1
bought, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
stationed, 1
them, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
most, 1
desirable, 1
posts,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
in, 1
villages,, 1

no, 1
one, 1
generally, 1
stops.", 1
"That's, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
remain, 1
here, 1
a, 1
day, 1
or, 1
two--arrange, 1
accordingly.", 1
As, 1
Bertuccio, 1
was, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
room, 1
to, 1
give, 1
the, 1
requisite, 1
orders,, 1
Baptistin, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door:, 1
he, 1
held, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
on, 1
a, 1
silver, 1
waiter., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing, 1
here?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
seeing, 1
him, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
dust;, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
send, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
Baptistin,, 1
without, 1
answering,, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
"Important, 1
and, 1
urgent,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
The, 1
count, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
read:--, 1
"M., 1
de, 1

the, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
off, 1
some, 1
papers, 1
supposed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
the, 1
secretary, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room., 1
The, 1
count's, 1
well-known, 1
courage, 1
will, 1
render, 1
unnecessary, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
the, 1
police,, 1
whose, 1
interference, 1
might, 1
seriously, 1
affect, 1

by, 1
any, 1

from, 1
the, 1
bedroom,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
concealing, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
his, 1
property, 1
himself., 1
Many, 1
attendants, 1
or, 1
apparent, 1
precautions, 1
would, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
villain, 1
from, 1
the, 1
attempt,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1

would, 1
lose, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
of, 1
discovering, 1
an, 1
enemy, 1

chance, 1
has, 1
revealed, 1

should, 1
fail, 1

another, 1

made.", 1
The, 1
count's, 1
first, 1
idea, 1
was, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
an, 1
artifice--a, 1
gross, 1
deception,, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
his, 1
attention, 1
from, 1
a, 1
minor, 1
danger, 1
in, 1

to, 1

him, 1

a, 1
greater., 1
He, 1
was, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
sending, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
the, 1
commissary, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
advice, 1
of, 1
his, 1
anonymous, 1
friend,, 1
or, 1
perhaps, 1
because, 1
of, 1
that, 1
advice,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
be, 1
some, 1
personal, 1
enemy,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
alone, 1
should, 1
recognize, 1
and, 1
over, 1
whom,, 1
if, 1
such, 1
were, 1
the, 1
case,, 1
he, 1
alone, 1
would, 1
gain, 1

advantage,, 1

Fiesco, 1
[*], 1
had, 1
done, 1
over, 1
the, 1
Moor, 1
who, 1
would, 1

We, 1
know, 1

against, 1

let, 1
everything, 1
remain, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
only, 1
close, 1
the, 1
shutters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
floor.", 1
"And, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
floor?", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
they, 1
are, 1
never, 1
closed., 1
Go!", 1
The, 1
count, 1
signified, 1
his, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
dining, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
but, 1
Ali, 1
should, 1
attend, 1
him., 1
Having, 1
dined, 1
with, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
tranquillity, 1
and, 1
moderation,, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
signal, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
him,, 1
went, 1
out, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side-gate, 1
and, 1
on, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
Bois, 1
de, 1
Boulogne, 1
turned,, 1
apparently, 1
without, 1
design, 1
towards, 1
Paris, 1
and, 1
at, 1
twilight;, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
opposite, 1
his, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs-Elysees., 1
All, 1
was, 1
dark;, 1
one, 1
solitary,, 1
feeble, 1
light, 1
was, 1
burning, 1
in, 1
the, 1
porter's, 1
lodge,, 1
about, 1
forty, 1
paces, 1
distant, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
as, 1
Baptistin, 1
had, 1
said., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
a, 1
tree,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
that, 1
scrutinizing, 1
glance, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
rarely, 1
deceived,, 1
looked, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down, 1
the, 1
avenue,, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
passers-by,, 1
and, 1
carefully, 1
looked, 1
down, 1
the, 1
neighboring, 1
streets,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
was, 1
concealed., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
passed, 1
thus,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
was, 1
watching, 1
him., 1
He, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
side-door, 1
with, 1
Ali,, 1
entered, 1
hurriedly,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
servants', 1
staircase,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
key,, 1
gained, 1
his, 1
bedroom, 1
without, 1
opening, 1
or, 1
disarranging, 1
a, 1
single, 1
curtain,, 1
without, 1
even, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
having, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
suspicion, 1
that, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
supposed, 1
empty,, 1
contained, 1
its, 1
chief, 1
occupant., 1
Arrived, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bedroom,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
to, 1
stop;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
dressing-room,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
examined., 1
Everything, 1
appeared, 1
as, 1
usual--the, 1
precious, 1
secretary, 1
in, 1
its, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
key, 1
in, 1
the, 1
secretary., 1
He, 1
double, 1
locked, 1
it,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
key,, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bedroom, 1
door,, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
double, 1
staple, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bolt,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
in., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Ali, 1
had, 1
procured, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
the, 1
count, 1
required--namely,, 1
a, 1
short, 1
carbine, 1
and, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
double-barrelled, 1
pistols,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
as, 1
sure, 1
an, 1
aim, 1
might, 1
be, 1
taken, 1
as, 1
with, 1
a, 1
single-barrelled, 1
one., 1
Thus, 1
armed,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
held, 1
the, 1
lives, 1
of, 1
five, 1
men, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
It, 1
was, 1
about, 1
half-past, 1
nine., 1
The, 1
count, 1
and, 1
Ali, 1
ate, 1
in, 1
haste, 1
a, 1
crust, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
Spanish, 1
wine;, 1
then, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
slipped, 1
aside, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
movable, 1
panels,, 1
which, 1
enabled, 1
him, 1
to, 1
see, 1
into, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
room., 1
He, 1
had, 1
within, 1
his, 1
reach, 1
his, 1
pistols, 1
and, 1
carbine,, 1
and, 1
Ali,, 1
standing, 1
near, 1
him,, 1
held, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
small, 1
Arabian, 1
hatchets,, 1
whose, 1
form, 1
has, 1
not, 1
varied, 1
since, 1
the, 1
Crusades., 1
Through, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bedroom,, 1
on, 1
a, 1
line, 1
with, 1
that, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
could, 1
see, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street., 1
Two, 1
hours, 1
passed, 1
thus., 1
It, 1
was, 1
intensely, 1
dark;, 1
still, 1
Ali,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wild, 1
nature,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
thanks, 1
doubtless, 1
to, 1
his, 1
long, 1
confinement,, 1
could, 1
distinguish, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
trees., 1
The, 1
little, 1
light, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lodge, 1
had, 1
long, 1
been, 1
extinct., 1
It, 1
might, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
the, 1
attack,, 1
if, 1
indeed, 1
an, 1
attack, 1
was, 1
projected,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
made, 1
from, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
floor,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
from, 1
a, 1
window;, 1
in, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
opinion,, 1
the, 1
villains, 1
sought, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
not, 1
his, 1
money., 1
It, 1
would, 1
be, 1
his, 1
bedroom, 1
they, 1
would, 1
attack,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
must, 1
reach, 1
it, 1
by, 1
the, 1
back, 1
staircase,, 1
or, 1
by, 1
the, 1
window, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room., 1
The, 1
clock, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Invalides, 1
struck, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
to, 1
twelve;, 1
the, 1
west, 1
wind, 1
bore, 1
on, 1
its, 1
moistened, 1
gusts, 1
the, 1
doleful, 1
vibration, 1
of, 1
the, 1
three, 1
strokes., 1
As, 1
the, 1
last, 1
stroke, 1
died, 1
away,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room;, 1
this, 1
first, 1
sound,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
this, 1
first, 1
grinding,, 1
was, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
second,, 1
then, 1
a, 1
third;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
fourth,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
knew, 1
what, 1
to, 1
expect., 1
A, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
well-practised, 1
hand, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
cutting, 1
the, 1
four, 1
sides, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pane, 1
of, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
a, 1
diamond., 1
The, 1
count, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
more, 1
rapidly., 1
Inured, 1
as, 1
men, 1
may, 1
be, 1
to, 1
danger,, 1
forewarned, 1
as, 1
they, 1
may, 1
be, 1
of, 1
peril,, 1
they, 1
understand,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fluttering, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
and, 1
the, 1
shuddering, 1
of, 1
the, 1
frame,, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
difference, 1
between, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
and, 1
a, 1
reality,, 1
between, 1
the, 1
project, 1
and, 1
the, 1
execution., 1
However,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
only, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
apprise, 1
Ali,, 1
who,, 1
understanding, 1
that, 1
danger, 1
was, 1
approaching, 1
from, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side,, 1
drew, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
his, 1
master., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
eager, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
and, 1
number, 1
of, 1
his, 1
enemies., 1
The, 1
window, 1
whence, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
proceeded, 1
was, 1
opposite, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
by, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
could, 1
see, 1
into, 1
the, 1
dressing-room., 1
He, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
that, 1
window--he, 1
distinguished, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness;, 1
then, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
panes, 1
became, 1
quite, 1
opaque,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
a, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
paper, 1
were, 1
stuck, 1
on, 1
the, 1
outside,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
square, 1
cracked, 1
without, 1
falling., 1
Through, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
an, 1
arm, 1
was, 1
passed, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
fastening,, 1
then, 1
a, 1
second;, 1
the, 1
window, 1
turned, 1
on, 1
its, 1
hinges,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
man, 1
entered., 1
He, 1
was, 1
alone., 1
"That's, 1
a, 1
daring, 1
rascal,", 1
whispered, 1
the, 1
count., 1
At, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
Ali, 1
touched, 1
him, 1
slightly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shoulder., 1
He, 1
turned;, 1
Ali, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
they, 1
were,, 1
facing, 1
the, 1
street., 1
"I, 1
see!", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
two, 1
of, 1
them;, 1
one, 1
does, 1
the, 1
work, 1
while, 1
the, 1
other, 1
stands, 1
guard.", 1
He, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
one, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room., 1
The, 1
glass-cutter, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
feeling, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
before, 1
him., 1
At, 1
last, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
made, 1
himself, 1
familiar, 1
with, 1
his, 1
surroundings., 1
There, 1
were, 1
two, 1
doors;, 1
he, 1
bolted, 1
them, 1
both., 1
When, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bedroom, 1
door,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
pistols;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
simply, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bolts, 1
sliding, 1
in, 1
their, 1
copper, 1
rings., 1
It, 1
was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
precaution., 1
The, 1
nocturnal, 1
visitor,, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
staples,, 1
might, 1
now, 1
think, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
home,, 1
and, 1
pursue, 1
his, 1
purpose, 1
with, 1
full, 1
security., 1
Alone, 1
and, 1
free, 1
to, 1
act, 1
as, 1
he, 1
wished,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
then, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
something, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
could, 1
not, 1
discern,, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
a, 1
stand,, 1
then, 1
went, 1
straight, 1
to, 1
the, 1
secretary,, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
and, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
his, 1
expectation, 1
found, 1
that, 1
the, 1
key, 1
was, 1
missing., 1
But, 1
the, 1
glass-cutter, 1
was, 1
a, 1
prudent, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
provided, 1
for, 1
all, 1
emergencies., 1
The, 1
count, 1
soon, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
rattling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
skeleton, 1
keys,, 1
such, 1
as, 1
the, 1
locksmith, 1
brings, 1
when, 1
called, 1
to, 1
force, 1
a, 1
lock,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
thieves, 1
call, 1
nightingales,, 1
doubtless, 1
from, 1
the, 1
music, 1
of, 1
their, 1
nightly, 1
song, 1
when, 1
they, 1
grind, 1
against, 1
the, 1
bolt., 1
"Ah,, 1
ha,", 1
whispered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
disappointment,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
only, 1
a, 1
thief.", 1
But, 1
the, 1
man, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
could, 1
not, 1
find, 1
the, 1
right, 1
key., 1
He, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
instrument, 1
he, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stand,, 1
touched, 1
a, 1
spring,, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
a, 1
pale, 1
light,, 1
just, 1
bright, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
render, 1
objects, 1
distinct,, 1
was, 1
reflected, 1
on, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
countenance., 1
"By, 1
heavens,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
starting, 1
back,, 1
"it, 1
is"--, 1
Ali, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
hatchet., 1
"Don't, 1
stir,", 1
whispered, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"and, 1
put, 1
down, 1
your, 1
hatchet;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
require, 1
no, 1
arms.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
added, 1
some, 1
words, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
exclamation, 1
which, 1
surprise, 1
had, 1
drawn, 1
from, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
faint, 1
as, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been,, 1
had, 1
startled, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pose, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
knife-grinder., 1
It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
order, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
just, 1
given,, 1
for, 1
immediately, 1
Ali, 1
went, 1
noiselessly,, 1
and, 1
returned,, 1
bearing, 1
a, 1
black, 1
dress, 1
and, 1
a, 1
three-cornered, 1
hat., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
rapidly, 1
taken, 1
off, 1
his, 1
great-coat,, 1
waistcoat,, 1
and, 1
shirt,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
might, 1
distinguish, 1
by, 1
the, 1
glimmering, 1
through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
panel, 1
that, 1
he, 1
wore, 1
a, 1
pliant, 1
tunic, 1
of, 1
steel, 1
mail,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
the, 1
last, 1
in, 1
France,, 1
where, 1
daggers, 1
are, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
dreaded,, 1
was, 1
worn, 1
by, 1
King, 1
Louis, 1
XVI.,, 1
who, 1
feared, 1
the, 1
dagger, 1
at, 1
his, 1
breast,, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
head, 1
was, 1
cleft, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hatchet., 1
The, 1
tunic, 1
soon, 1
disappeared, 1
under, 1
a, 1
long, 1
cassock,, 1
as, 1
did, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
under, 1
a, 1
priest's, 1
wig;, 1
the, 1
three-cornered, 1
hat, 1
over, 1
this, 1
effectually, 1
transformed, 1
the, 1
count, 1
into, 1
an, 1
abbe., 1
The, 1
man,, 1
hearing, 1
nothing, 1
more,, 1
stood, 1
erect,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
completing, 1
his, 1
disguise, 1
had, 1
advanced, 1
straight, 1
to, 1
the, 1
secretary,, 1
whose, 1
lock, 1
was, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
crack, 1
under, 1
his, 1
nightingale., 1
"Try, 1
again,", 1
whispered, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
depended, 1
on, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
spring,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
the, 1
picklock,, 1
clever, 1
as, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be--"try, 1
again,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes', 1
work, 1
there.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window., 1
The, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
seated, 1
on, 1
a, 1
fence, 1
had, 1
got, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
still, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
street;, 1
but,, 1
strange, 1
as, 1
it, 1
appeared,, 1
he, 1
cared, 1
not, 1
for, 1
those, 1
who, 1
might, 1
pass, 1
from, 1
the, 1
avenue, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Champs-Elysees, 1
or, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Honore;, 1
his, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
engrossed, 1
with, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count's,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
only, 1
aim, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
to, 1
discern, 1
every, 1
movement, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dressing-room., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
suddenly, 1
struck, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
on, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
and, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
his, 1
lips;, 1
then, 1
drawing, 1
near, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
he, 1
whispered,--, 1
"Remain, 1
here,, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dark,, 1
and, 1
whatever, 1
noise, 1
you, 1
hear,, 1
whatever, 1
passes,, 1
only, 1
come, 1
in, 1
or, 1
show, 1
yourself, 1
if, 1
I, 1
call, 1
you.", 1
Ali, 1
bowed, 1
in, 1
token, 1
of, 1
strict, 1
obedience., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
then, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
lighted, 1
taper, 1
from, 1
a, 1
closet,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
the, 1
thief, 1
was, 1
deeply, 1
engaged, 1
with, 1
his, 1
lock,, 1
silently, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
taking, 1
care, 1
that, 1
the, 1
light, 1
should, 1
shine, 1
directly, 1
on, 1
his, 1
face., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened, 1
so, 1
quietly, 1
that, 1
the, 1
thief, 1
heard, 1
no, 1
sound;, 1
but,, 1
to, 1
his, 1
astonishment,, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was, 1
suddenly, 1
illuminated., 1
He, 1
turned., 1
"Ah,, 1
good-evening,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Caderousse,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing, 1
here,, 1
at, 1
such, 1
an, 1
hour?", 1
"The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Caderousse;, 1
and,, 1
not, 1
knowing, 1
how, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
apparition, 1
could, 1
have, 1
entered, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bolted, 1
the, 1
doors,, 1
he, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
his, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
keys,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
stupefied., 1
The, 1
count, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
between, 1
Caderousse, 1
and, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
thus, 1
cutting, 1
off, 1
from, 1
the, 1
thief, 1
his, 1
only, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
retreat., 1
"The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni!", 1
repeated, 1
Caderousse,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
haggard, 1
gaze, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Yes,, 1
undoubtedly,, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
himself,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
glad, 1
you, 1
recognize, 1
me,, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
Caderousse;, 1
it, 1
proves, 1
you, 1
have, 1
a, 1
good, 1
memory,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
since, 1
we, 1
last, 1
met.", 1
This, 1
calmness, 1
of, 1
Busoni,, 1
combined, 1
with, 1
his, 1
irony, 1
and, 1
boldness,, 1
staggered, 1
Caderousse., 1
"The, 1
abbe,, 1
the, 1
abbe!", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
clinching, 1
his, 1
fists,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
chattering., 1
"So, 1
you, 1
would, 1
rob, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
false, 1
abbe., 1
"Reverend, 1
sir,", 1
murmured, 1
Caderousse,, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
regain, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
pitilessly, 1
blocked--"reverend, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know--believe, 1
me--I, 1
take, 1
my, 1
oath"--, 1
"A, 1
pane, 1
of, 1
glass, 1
out,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"a, 1
dark, 1
lantern,, 1
a, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
false, 1
keys,, 1
a, 1
secretary, 1
half, 1
forced--it, 1
is, 1
tolerably, 1
evident"--, 1
Caderousse, 1
was, 1
choking;, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
some, 1
corner, 1
to, 1
hide, 1
in,, 1
some, 1
way, 1
of, 1
escape., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
are, 1
still, 1
the, 1
same,--an, 1
assassin.", 1
"Reverend, 1
sir,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
know, 1
everything,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
I--it, 1
was, 1
La, 1
Carconte;, 1
that, 1
was, 1
proved, 1
at, 1
the, 1
trial,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
was, 1
only, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
galleys.", 1
"Is, 1
your, 1
time,, 1
then,, 1
expired,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
find, 1
you, 1
in, 1
a, 1
fair, 1
way, 1
to, 1
return, 1
there?", 1
"No,, 1
reverend, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
liberated, 1
by, 1
some, 1
one.", 1
"That, 1
some, 1
one, 1
has, 1
done, 1
society, 1
a, 1
great, 1
kindness.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
promised"--, 1
"And, 1
you, 1
are, 1
breaking, 1
your, 1
promise!", 1
interrupted, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Alas,, 1
yes!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse, 1
very, 1
uneasily., 1
"A, 1
bad, 1
relapse,, 1
that, 1
will, 1
lead, 1
you,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
mistake, 1
not,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Place, 1
de, 1
Greve., 1
So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
worse,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
worse--diavolo,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
say, 1
in, 1
my, 1
country.", 1
"Reverend, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
impelled"--, 1
"Every, 1
criminal, 1
says, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thing.", 1
"Poverty"--, 1
"Pshaw!", 1
said, 1
Busoni, 1
disdainfully;, 1
"poverty, 1
may, 1
make, 1
a, 1
man, 1
beg,, 1
steal, 1
a, 1
loaf, 1
of, 1
bread, 1
at, 1
a, 1

a, 1
secretary, 1
in, 1
a, 1
house, 1

inhabited., 1
And, 1
when, 1
the, 1
jeweller, 1
Johannes, 1

just, 1
paid, 1
you, 1
40,000., 1
francs, 1
for, 1

you,, 1

you, 1

him, 1
to, 1
get, 1
the, 1
diamond, 1
and, 1
the, 1
money, 1
both,, 1
was, 1
that, 1
also, 1
poverty?", 1
"Pardon,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
my, 1
life, 1
once,, 1

me, 1
again!", 1
"That, 1
is, 1

poor, 1
encouragement.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
alone,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,, 1
or, 1
have, 1
you, 1
there, 1
soldiers, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
seize, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
alone,", 1

the, 1
abbe,, 1

I, 1
will, 1
again, 1

pity, 1
on, 1

"Ah,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
drawing, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
may, 1
indeed, 1
say, 1
you, 1
are, 1
my, 1
deliverer!", 1
"You, 1
mean, 1
to, 1
say, 1
you, 1

been, 1
freed, 1
from, 1
confinement?", 1
"Yes,, 1

true,, 1

was, 1
your, 1
liberator?", 1

Englishman.", 1

Wilmore.", 1

know, 1
him;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
know, 1
if, 1
you, 1
lie.", 1
"Ah,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
simple, 1
truth.", 1
"Was, 1
this, 1
Englishman, 1
protecting, 1
you?", 1
"No,, 1
not, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
young, 1
Corsican,, 1
my, 1
companion.", 1
"What, 1
was, 1
this, 1
young, 1
Corsican's, 1
name?", 1
"Benedetto.", 1
"Is, 1
that, 1
his, 1
Christian, 1
name?", 1
"He, 1
had, 1
no, 1
other;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
foundling.", 1
"Then, 1
this, 1
young, 1
man, 1
escaped, 1
with, 1
you?", 1
"He, 1
did.", 1
"In, 1
what, 1
way?", 1
"We, 1
were, 1
working, 1
at, 1
St., 1
Mandrier,, 1
near, 1
Toulon., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
St., 1
Mandrier?", 1
"I, 1
do.", 1
"In, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
rest,, 1
between, 1
noon, 1
and, 1
one, 1
o'clock"--, 1
"Galley-slaves, 1

a, 1
nap, 1
after, 1
dinner!, 1
We, 1
may, 1
well, 1
pity, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
fellows!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"Nay,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
"one, 1
can't, 1
always, 1
work--one, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
dog.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better, 1
for, 1
the, 1
dogs,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"While, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
slept,, 1
then,, 1
we, 1
went, 1
away, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance;, 1
we, 1
severed, 1
our, 1
fetters, 1
with, 1
a, 1
file, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
had, 1
given, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
swam, 1
away.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
become, 1
of, 1
this, 1
Benedetto?", 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
know.", 1
"You, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
know.", 1
"No,, 1
in, 1
truth;, 1
we, 1
parted, 1
at, 1
Hyeres.", 1
And,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
more, 1
weight, 1
to, 1
his, 1
protestation,, 1
Caderousse, 1
advanced, 1
another, 1
step, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
in, 1
his, 1
place,, 1
as, 1
calm, 1
as, 1
ever,, 1
and, 1
pursuing, 1
his, 1
interrogation., 1
"You, 1
lie,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
irresistible, 1
authority., 1
"Reverend, 1
sir!", 1
"You, 1
lie!, 1
This, 1
man, 1
is, 1
still, 1
your, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
perhaps,, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
him, 1
as, 1
your, 1
accomplice.", 1
"Oh,, 1
reverend, 1
sir!", 1
"Since, 1
you, 1
left, 1
Toulon, 1
what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
lived, 1
on?, 1
Answer, 1
me!", 1
"On, 1
what, 1
I, 1
could, 1
get.", 1
"You, 1
lie,", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
a, 1
third, 1
time,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
still, 1
more, 1
imperative, 1
tone., 1
Caderousse,, 1
terrified,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
lived, 1
on, 1
the, 1
money, 1
he, 1
has, 1
given, 1
you.", 1
"True,", 1
said, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"Benedetto, 1
has, 1
become, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
great, 1
lord.", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
he, 1
be, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
great, 1
lord?", 1
"A, 1
natural, 1
son.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
that, 1
great, 1
lord's, 1
name?", 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
the, 1
very, 1
same, 1
in, 1
whose, 1
house, 1
we, 1
are.", 1
"Benedetto, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
son?", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
astonished, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn., 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
count, 1
has, 1
found, 1
him, 1
a, 1
false, 1
father--since, 1
the, 1
count, 1
gives, 1
him, 1
four, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
month,, 1
and, 1
leaves, 1
him, 1
500,000, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
his, 1
will.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
factitious, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
began, 1
to, 1
understand;, 1
"and, 1
what, 1
name, 1
does, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
bear, 1
meanwhile?", 1
"Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
"Is, 1
it,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
young, 1
man, 1
whom, 1
my, 1
friend, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
has, 1
received, 1
into, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Exactly.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
suffer, 1
that,, 1
you, 1
wretch--you,, 1
who, 1
know, 1
his, 1
life, 1

his, 1
crime?", 1
"Why, 1
should, 1
I, 1
stand, 1
in, 1
a, 1
comrade's, 1
way?", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
you, 1
who, 1
should, 1

I.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
reverend, 1
sir.", 1
"Why, 1
not?", 1
"Because, 1
you, 1
would, 1
bring, 1
us, 1
to, 1
ruin.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
think, 1
that, 1
to, 1

such, 1
villains, 1

will, 1
become, 1

"Reverend, 1

Caderousse,, 1
drawing, 1
still, 1
nearer., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
expose, 1
all.", 1
"To, 1
whom?", 1
"To, 1
M., 1
Danglars.", 1
"By, 1
heaven!", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse,, 1
drawing, 1
from, 1
his, 1
waistcoat, 1
an, 1
open, 1
knife,, 1
and, 1
striking, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
breast,, 1
"you, 1
shall, 1
disclose, 1
nothing,, 1
reverend, 1

Caderousse's, 1
great, 1
astonishment,, 1
the, 1
knife,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
piercing, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
breast,, 1
flew, 1
back, 1
blunted., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
assassin's, 1
wrist,, 1

wrung, 1
it, 1
with, 1
such, 1
strength, 1
that, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
stiffened, 1
fingers,, 1
and, 1
Caderousse, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
pain., 1
But, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
disregarding, 1
his, 1
cry,, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
wring, 1
the, 1
bandit's, 1
wrist,, 1
until,, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
being, 1
dislocated,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
first, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
then, 1
flat, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
The, 1
count, 1
then, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
on, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
saying,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
not, 1
what, 1
restrains, 1
me, 1
from, 1
crushing, 1
thy, 1
skull,, 1
rascal.", 1
"Ah,, 1
mercy--mercy!", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse., 1
The, 1
count, 1
withdrew, 1
his, 1
foot., 1
"Rise!", 1
said, 1
he., 1
Caderousse, 1
rose., 1
"What, 1
a, 1
wrist, 1
you, 1
have,, 1
reverend, 1
sir!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
stroking, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
all, 1
bruised, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fleshy, 1
pincers, 1
which, 1
had, 1
held, 1
it;, 1
"what, 1
a, 1
wrist!", 1
"Silence!, 1
God, 1

me, 1

still, 1
serving, 1
him.", 1
"Oh!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
groaning, 1
with, 1
pain., 1
"Take, 1
this, 1
pen, 1
and, 1
paper,, 1

"You, 1
lie!, 1
Take, 1
this, 1

Caderousse,, 1
awed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
superior, 1
power, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
sat, 1
down, 1

Caderousse,, 1

out, 1
of, 1

stood, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ladder., 1
"Now, 1
go, 1
down,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
folding, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
Understanding, 1
he, 1
had, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
fear, 1
from, 1
him,, 1
Caderousse, 1
began, 1
to, 1
go, 1
down., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
count, 1
brought, 1
the, 1
taper, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs-Elysees, 1
that, 1
a, 1
man, 1
was, 1
getting, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window, 1
while, 1
another, 1
held, 1
a, 1
light., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing,, 1
reverend, 1
sir?, 1
Suppose, 1
a, 1
watchman, 1
should, 1
pass?", 1
And, 1
he, 1
blew, 1
out, 1
the, 1
light., 1
He, 1
then, 1
descended,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
when, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
touch, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
satisfied, 1
of, 1
his, 1
safety., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bedroom,, 1
and,, 1
glancing, 1
rapidly, 1
from, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
to, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
first, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
after, 1
walking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
ladder, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
at, 1
a, 1
different, 1
part, 1
from, 1
where, 1
he, 1
came, 1
in., 1
The, 1
count, 1
then, 1
looking, 1
over, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
waiting, 1
run, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
direction,, 1
and, 1
place, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
where, 1
Caderousse, 1
would, 1
come, 1
over., 1
Caderousse, 1
climbed, 1
the, 1
ladder, 1
slowly,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
over, 1
the, 1
coping, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
the, 1
street, 1
was, 1
quiet., 1
No, 1
one, 1
could, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
or, 1
heard., 1
The, 1
clock, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Invalides, 1
struck, 1
one., 1
Then, 1
Caderousse, 1
sat, 1
astride, 1
the, 1
coping,, 1
and, 1
drawing, 1
up, 1
his, 1
ladder, 1
passed, 1
it, 1
over, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
descend,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
to, 1
slide, 1
down, 1
by, 1
the, 1
two, 1
stanchions,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
did, 1
with, 1
an, 1
ease, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
how, 1
accustomed, 1
he, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
exercise., 1
But,, 1
once, 1
started,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
stop., 1
In, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
he, 1
see, 1
a, 1
man, 1
start, 1
from, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
halfway, 1
down--in, 1
vain, 1
did, 1
he, 1
see, 1
an, 1
arm, 1
raised, 1
as, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
Before, 1
he, 1
could, 1
defend, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
arm, 1
struck, 1
him, 1
so, 1
violently, 1
in, 1
the, 1
back, 1
that, 1
he, 1
let, 1
go, 1
the, 1
ladder,, 1
crying,, 1
"Help!", 1
A, 1
second, 1
blow, 1
struck, 1
him, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
in, 1
the, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
fell,, 1
calling,, 1
"Help,, 1
murder!", 1
Then,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
rolled, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
his, 1
adversary, 1
seized, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
struck, 1
him, 1
a, 1
third, 1
blow, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chest., 1
This, 1
time, 1
Caderousse, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
call, 1
again,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
could, 1
only, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
groan,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
shuddered, 1
as, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
flowed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
three, 1
wounds., 1
The, 1
assassin,, 1
finding, 1
that, 1
he, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
cried, 1
out,, 1
lifted, 1
his, 1
head, 1
up, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hair;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
was, 1
distorted., 1
The, 1
murderer,, 1
supposing, 1
him, 1
dead,, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
Then, 1
Caderousse,, 1
feeling, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
leaving, 1
him,, 1
raised, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
elbow,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dying, 1
voice, 1
cried, 1
with, 1
great, 1
effort,, 1
"Murder!, 1
I, 1
am, 1
dying!, 1
Help,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,--help!", 1
This, 1
mournful, 1
appeal, 1
pierced, 1
the, 1
darkness., 1
The, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
back-staircase, 1
opened,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
side-gate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
and, 1
Ali, 1
and, 1
his, 1
master, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
with, 1
lights., 1
Chapter, 1
83., 1
The, 1
Hand, 1
of, 1
God., 1
Caderousse, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
call, 1
piteously,, 1
"Help,, 1
reverend, 1
sir,, 1
help!", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Help,", 1
cried, 1
Caderousse;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
murdered!", 1
"We, 1
are, 1
here;--take, 1
courage.", 1
"Ah,, 1
it's, 1
all, 1
over!, 1
You, 1
are, 1
come, 1
too, 1
late--you, 1
are, 1
come, 1
to, 1
see, 1
me, 1
die., 1
What, 1
blows,, 1
what, 1
blood!", 1
He, 1
fainted., 1
Ali, 1
and, 1
his, 1
master, 1
conveyed, 1
the, 1
wounded, 1
man, 1
into, 1
a, 1
room., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
Ali, 1
to, 1
undress, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
then, 1
examined, 1
his, 1
dreadful, 1
wounds., 1
"My, 1
God!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"thy, 1
vengeance, 1
is, 1
sometimes, 1
delayed,, 1
but, 1
only, 1
that, 1
it, 1
may, 1
fall, 1
the, 1
more, 1
effectually.", 1
Ali, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
master, 1
for, 1
further, 1
instructions., 1
"Bring, 1
here, 1
immediately, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
lives, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Honore., 1
As, 1
you, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
lodge,, 1
wake, 1
the, 1
porter,, 1
and, 1
send, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
surgeon.", 1
Ali, 1
obeyed,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
revived., 1
When, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
man, 1
again, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mournful, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
pity,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
moved, 1
as, 1
if, 1
in, 1
prayer., 1
"A, 1
surgeon,, 1
reverend, 1
sir--a, 1
surgeon!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
one,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
abbe., 1
"I, 1
know, 1
he, 1
cannot, 1
save, 1
my, 1
life,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
may, 1
strengthen, 1
me, 1
to, 1
give, 1
my, 1
evidence.", 1
"Against, 1
whom?", 1
"Against, 1
my, 1
murderer.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
recognize, 1
him?", 1
"Yes;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Benedetto.", 1
"The, 1
young, 1
Corsican?", 1
"Himself.", 1
"Your, 1
comrade?", 1
"Yes., 1
After, 1
giving, 1
me, 1
the, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
this, 1
house,, 1
doubtless, 1
hoping, 1
I, 1
should, 1
kill, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
he, 1
thus, 1
become, 1
his, 1
heir,, 1
or, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
would, 1
kill, 1
me, 1

I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
out, 1
of, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
he, 1
waylaid, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
murdered, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
also, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
the, 1
procureur.", 1
"He, 1
will, 1
not, 1

in, 1
time;, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
my, 1
life, 1
fast, 1
ebbing.", 1
"Wait, 1
a, 1
moment,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
He, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
in, 1
five, 1

Lord, 1
Wilmore,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"think, 1
again,--do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
recollect, 1
me?", 1
Those, 1
was, 1
a, 1
magic, 1
effect, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
words,, 1
which, 1
once, 1
more, 1
revived, 1
the, 1
exhausted, 1
powers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
miserable, 1
man., 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
you, 1
and, 1
known, 1
you, 1
formerly.", 1
"Yes,, 1
Caderousse,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
me;, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
me, 1
once.", 1
"Who,, 1
then,, 1
are, 1
you?, 1
and, 1
why,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
knew, 1
me,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
let, 1
me, 1
die?", 1
"Because, 1
nothing, 1
can, 1
save, 1
you;, 1
your, 1
wounds, 1
are, 1
mortal., 1
Had, 1
it, 1
been, 1
possible, 1
to, 1
save, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
considered, 1
it, 1
another, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
God's, 1
mercy,, 1

I, 1
would, 1
again, 1
have, 1

to, 1

by, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
tomb.", 1
"By, 1
your, 1
father's, 1
tomb!", 1
said, 1
Caderousse,, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
a, 1
supernatural, 1
power,, 1
and, 1
half-raising, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
see, 1
more, 1
distinctly, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
oath, 1
which, 1
all, 1
men, 1
hold, 1
sacred;, 1
"who,, 1
then,, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
approach, 1
of, 1
death., 1
He, 1
knew, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
last, 1
struggle., 1
He, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man,, 1
and,, 1
leaning, 1
over, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
melancholy, 1
look,, 1
he, 1
whispered,, 1
"I, 1
am--I, 1
am"--And, 1
his, 1
almost, 1
closed, 1
lips, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
name, 1
so, 1
low, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
himself, 1
appeared, 1
afraid, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
it., 1
Caderousse,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
back,, 1
then, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
raising, 1
them, 1
with, 1
a, 1
desperate, 1
effort,, 1
"O, 1
my, 1
God,, 1
my, 1
God!", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"pardon, 1
me, 1
for, 1
having, 1
denied, 1
thee;, 1
thou, 1
dost, 1

My, 1
God,, 1
my, 1

Pardon, 1
me,, 1
my, 1

me,, 1

my, 1

Caderousse, 1
sighed, 1
deeply,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
with, 1
a, 1
groan., 1
The, 1
blood, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
flowed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
wounds., 1
He, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
"One!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
mysteriously,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
disfigured, 1
by, 1
so, 1
awful, 1
a, 1
death., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
surgeon, 1

the, 1
procureur, 1
arrived,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
porter,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
by, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
received, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
praying, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corpse., 1
Chapter, 1
84., 1
Beauchamp., 1
The, 1
daring, 1
attempt, 1
to, 1
rob, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
the, 1
topic, 1
of, 1
conversation, 1
throughout, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
fortnight., 1
The, 1
dying, 1
man, 1
had, 1
signed, 1
a, 1
deposition, 1
declaring, 1
Benedetto, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
assassin., 1
The, 1
police, 1
had, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
strictest, 1
search, 1
for, 1
the, 1
murderer., 1
Caderousse's, 1
knife,, 1
dark, 1
lantern,, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
keys,, 1
and, 1
clothing,, 1
excepting, 1
the, 1
waistcoat,, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
found,, 1
were, 1
deposited, 1
at, 1
the, 1
registry;, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
was, 1
conveyed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
morgue., 1
The, 1
count, 1
told, 1
every, 1
one, 1
that, 1
this, 1
adventure, 1
had, 1
happened, 1
during, 1
his, 1
absence, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
only, 1
knew, 1
what, 1
was, 1
related, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
who, 1
that, 1
evening,, 1
by, 1
mere, 1
chance,, 1
had, 1
requested, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
night, 1
in, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
some, 1
valuable, 1
books, 1
in, 1
his, 1
library., 1
Bertuccio, 1
alone, 1
turned, 1
pale, 1
whenever, 1
Benedetto's, 1
name, 1
was, 1
mentioned, 1
in, 1
his, 1
presence,, 1
but, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
notice, 1
his, 1
doing, 1
so., 1
Villefort,, 1
being, 1
called, 1
on, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
the, 1
crime,, 1
was, 1
preparing, 1
his, 1
brief, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
ardor, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
exercise, 1
when, 1
required, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
in, 1
criminal, 1
cases., 1
But, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
had, 1
already, 1
passed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1
diligent, 1
search, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unsuccessful;, 1
the, 1
attempted, 1
robbery, 1
and, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
of, 1
the, 1
robber, 1
by, 1
his, 1
comrade, 1
were, 1
almost, 1
forgotten, 1
in, 1
anticipation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
It, 1
was, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
this, 1
wedding, 1
would, 1
shortly, 1
take, 1
place,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
received, 1
at, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
as, 1
the, 1
betrothed., 1
Letters, 1
had, 1
been, 1
despatched, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
highly, 1
approved, 1
of, 1
the, 1
union,, 1
regretted, 1
his, 1
inability, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
Parma, 1
at, 1
that, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
promised, 1
a, 1
wedding, 1
gift, 1
of, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
livres., 1
It, 1
was, 1
agreed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
three, 1
millions, 1
should, 1
be, 1
intrusted, 1
to, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
invest;, 1
some, 1
persons, 1
had, 1
warned, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
of, 1
his, 1
future, 1
father-in-law,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
of, 1
late, 1
sustained, 1
repeated, 1
losses;, 1
but, 1
with, 1
sublime, 1
disinterestedness, 1
and, 1
confidence, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
listen,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
express, 1
a, 1
single, 1
doubt, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baron., 1
The, 1
baron, 1
adored, 1
Count, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti:, 1
not, 1
so, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
Danglars., 1
With, 1
an, 1
instinctive, 1
hatred, 1
of, 1
matrimony,, 1
she, 1
suffered, 1
Andrea's, 1
attentions, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
get, 1
rid, 1
of, 1
Morcerf;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
Andrea, 1
urged, 1
his, 1
suit,, 1
she, 1
betrayed, 1
an, 1
entire, 1
dislike, 1
to, 1
him., 1
The, 1
baron, 1
might, 1
possibly, 1
have, 1
perceived, 1
it,, 1
but,, 1
attributing, 1
it, 1
to, 1
a, 1
caprice,, 1
feigned, 1
ignorance., 1
The, 1
delay, 1
demanded, 1
by, 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
nearly, 1
expired., 1
Morcerf, 1
appreciated, 1
the, 1
advice, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
let, 1
things, 1
die, 1
away, 1
of, 1
their, 1
own, 1
accord., 1
No, 1
one, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
up, 1
the, 1
remark, 1
about, 1
the, 1
general,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
in, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
who, 1
betrayed, 1
the, 1
castle, 1
of, 1
Yanina, 1
the, 1
noble, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
House, 1
of, 1
Peers., 1
Albert,, 1
however, 1
felt, 1
no, 1
less, 1
insulted;, 1
the, 1
few, 1
lines, 1
which, 1
had, 1
irritated, 1
him, 1
were, 1
certainly, 1
intended, 1
as, 1
an, 1
insult., 1
Besides,, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
conference, 1
left, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
recollection, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
He, 1
cherished, 1
the, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
duel,, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
its, 1
true, 1
cause, 1
even, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seconds., 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
since, 1
the, 1
day, 1
he, 1
visited, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
inquired, 1
always, 1
told, 1
him, 1
he, 1
was, 1
out, 1
on, 1
a, 1
journey, 1
which, 1
would, 1
detain, 1
him, 1
some, 1
days., 1
Where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
no, 1
one, 1
knew., 1
One, 1
morning, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
awakened, 1
by, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
who, 1
announced, 1
Beauchamp., 1
Albert, 1
rubbed, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
servant, 1
to, 1
introduce, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
small, 1
smoking-room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground-floor,, 1
dressed, 1
himself, 1
quickly,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
down., 1
He, 1
found, 1
Beauchamp, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
room;, 1
on, 1
perceiving, 1
him, 1
Beauchamp, 1
stopped., 1
"Your, 1
arrival, 1
here,, 1
without, 1
waiting, 1
my, 1
visit, 1
at, 1
your, 1
house, 1
to-day,, 1
looks, 1
well,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"Tell, 1
me,, 1
may, 1
I, 1
shake, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
saying,, 1
'Beauchamp,, 1
acknowledge, 1
you, 1
have, 1
injured, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
retain, 1
my, 1
friendship,', 1
or, 1
must, 1
I, 1
simply, 1
propose, 1
to, 1
you, 1
a, 1
choice, 1
of, 1
arms?", 1
"Albert,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
sorrow, 1
which, 1
stupefied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
first, 1
sit, 1
down, 1
and, 1
talk.", 1
"Rather,, 1
sir,, 1
before, 1
we, 1
sit, 1
down,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
demand, 1
your, 1
answer.", 1
"Albert,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
journalist,, 1
"these, 1
are, 1
questions, 1
which, 1
it, 1
is, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
answer.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
facilitate, 1
it, 1
by, 1
repeating, 1
the, 1
question,, 1
'Will, 1
you,, 1
or, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
retract?'", 1
"Morcerf,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
'yes', 1
or, 1
'no', 1
to, 1
questions, 1
which, 1
concern, 1
the, 1
honor,, 1
the, 1
social, 1
interest,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
as, 1
Lieutenant-general, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
peer, 1
of, 1
France.", 1
"What, 1
must, 1
then, 1
be, 1
done?", 1
"What, 1
I, 1
have, 1
done,, 1
Albert., 1
I, 1
reasoned, 1
thus--money,, 1
time,, 1
and, 1
fatigue, 1
are, 1
nothing, 1
compared, 1
with, 1
the, 1
reputation, 1
and, 1
interests, 1
of, 1
a, 1
whole, 1
family;, 1
probabilities, 1
will, 1
not, 1
suffice,, 1
only, 1
facts, 1
will, 1
justify, 1
a, 1
deadly, 1
combat, 1
with, 1
a, 1
friend., 1
If, 1
I, 1
strike, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sword,, 1
or, 1
discharge, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
at, 1
man, 1
with, 1
whom,, 1
for, 1
three, 1
years,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
on, 1
terms, 1
of, 1
intimacy,, 1
I, 1
must,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
know, 1
why, 1
I, 1
do, 1
so;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
heart, 1
at, 1
ease,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
quiet, 1
conscience, 1
which, 1
a, 1
man, 1
needs, 1
when, 1
his, 1
own, 1
arm, 1
must, 1
save, 1
his, 1
life.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
impatiently,, 1
"what, 1
does, 1
all, 1
this, 1
mean?", 1
"It, 1
means, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
Yanina.", 1
"From, 1
Yanina?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Impossible!", 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
passport;, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
visa--Geneva,, 1
Milan,, 1
Venice,, 1
Trieste,, 1

government, 1
of, 1
a, 1
republic,, 1
a, 1
kingdom,, 1

empire?", 1
Albert, 1
cast, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
passport,, 1
then, 1
raised, 1
them, 1
in, 1
astonishment, 1
to, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
been, 1
to, 1
Yanina?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Albert,, 1
had, 1
you, 1
been, 1
a, 1
stranger,, 1
a, 1
foreigner,, 1
a, 1
simple, 1

came, 1
to, 1
demand, 1
satisfaction, 1

whom, 1
I, 1
killed, 1

"Not, 1
so,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
journalist;, 1
"on, 1
the, 1
contrary"--, 1
Albert, 1
turned, 1
frightfully, 1
pale;, 1
he, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
words, 1
died, 1
on, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
affectionate, 1
tone,, 1
"I, 1
should, 1
gladly, 1
make, 1
an, 1
apology;, 1

what?", 1

paragraph, 1
was, 1
correct,, 1

French, 1
officer"--, 1
"Yes.", 1
"Fernand?", 1
"Yes.", 1

"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
my, 1

Albert, 1
advanced, 1
furiously, 1
towards, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
restrained, 1
him, 1
more, 1
by, 1
a, 1
mild, 1
look, 1
than, 1
by, 1
his, 1
extended, 1
hand., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
Albert, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
attestation, 1
of, 1
four, 1
notable, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
Yanina,, 1
proving, 1
that, 1
Colonel, 1
Fernand, 1
Mondego,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
service, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Tepelini,, 1
had, 1
surrendered, 1
the, 1
castle, 1
for, 1
two, 1
million, 1
crowns., 1
The, 1
signatures, 1
were, 1
perfectly, 1
legal., 1
Albert, 1
tottered, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
overpowered, 1
in, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
It, 1
could, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
be, 1
doubted;, 1
the, 1
family, 1
name, 1
was, 1
fully, 1
given., 1
After, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
mournful, 1
silence,, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
overflowed,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
way, 1
to, 1
a, 1
flood, 1
of, 1
tears., 1
Beauchamp,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
with, 1
sincere, 1
pity, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
grief,, 1
approached, 1
him., 1
"Now,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"you, 1
understand, 1
me--do, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
see, 1
all,, 1

to, 1
judge, 1
of, 1
everything, 1

that, 1

might, 1

him, 1
justice., 1

on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1

are, 1

had, 1
done, 1
me,, 1

me, 1

hastened, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
Albert,, 1
still, 1
extended, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chair,, 1
covered, 1
his, 1
face, 1
with, 1
both, 1
hands,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
light, 1
from, 1
reaching, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
you,", 1
continued, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"to, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
Albert,, 1
that, 1
in, 1
this, 1
changing, 1
age,, 1
the, 1
faults, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
cannot, 1
revert, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
children., 1
Few, 1
have, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
this, 1
revolutionary, 1
period,, 1
in, 1
the, 1

of, 1

of, 1
the, 1

I, 1
have, 1
these, 1
proofs,, 1
Albert,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
your, 1
confidence,, 1
no, 1
human, 1
power, 1
can, 1
force, 1
me, 1
to, 1
a, 1
duel, 1
which, 1
your, 1
own, 1
conscience, 1
would, 1
reproach, 1
you, 1
with, 1

criminal,, 1

I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
what, 1
you, 1
can, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
demand, 1
of, 1
me., 1
Do, 1
you, 1

proofs,, 1
these, 1
attestations,, 1

I, 1
alone, 1
possess,, 1

it?", 1
Albert, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
neck., 1
"Ah,, 1
noble, 1
fellow!", 1
cried, 1
he., 1
"Take, 1
these,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
presenting, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
to, 1
Albert., 1
Albert, 1
seized, 1
them, 1
with, 1
a, 1
convulsive, 1
hand,, 1
tore, 1
them, 1
in, 1
pieces,, 1
and, 1
trembling, 1
lest, 1
the, 1
least, 1
vestige, 1
should, 1
escape, 1
and, 1
one, 1
day, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
confront, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
wax-light,, 1
always, 1
kept, 1
burning, 1
for, 1
cigars,, 1
and, 1
burned, 1
every, 1
fragment., 1
"Dear,, 1
excellent, 1
friend,", 1
murmured, 1
Albert,, 1
still, 1
burning, 1
the, 1
papers., 1
"Let, 1
all, 1
be, 1
forgotten, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sorrowful, 1
dream,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"let, 1
it, 1
vanish, 1
as, 1
the, 1
last, 1
sparks, 1
from, 1
the, 1
blackened, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
disappear, 1
as, 1
the, 1
smoke, 1
from, 1
those, 1
silent, 1
ashes.", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"and, 1
may, 1
there, 1
remain, 1
only, 1
the, 1
eternal, 1
friendship, 1
which, 1
I, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
my, 1
deliverer,, 1
which, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
transmitted, 1
to, 1
our, 1
children's, 1
children,, 1

shall, 1
always, 1

me, 1
that, 1

mother!, 1

her, 1
by, 1
the, 1

should, 1
have, 1
fled, 1
from, 1
my, 1
country.", 1
"Dear, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp., 1
But, 1
this, 1
sudden, 1
and, 1
factitious, 1
joy, 1
soon, 1
forsook, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
succeeded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
still, 1
greater, 1
grief., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"what, 1
still, 1
oppresses, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
friend?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
broken-hearted,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"Listen,, 1
Beauchamp!, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
thus,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
relinquish, 1
the, 1

the, 1
confidence,, 1

pride, 1
with, 1
which, 1
a, 1

untarnished, 1

inspires, 1
a, 1
son., 1

Beauchamp,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
how, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
now, 1
approach, 1
mine?, 1

draw, 1
back, 1
my, 1
forehead, 1
from, 1
his, 1
embrace,, 1
or, 1
withhold, 1
my, 1
hand, 1
from, 1
his?, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
most, 1
wretched, 1
of, 1
men., 1

my, 1
mother,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
mother!", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
gazing, 1
through, 1
his, 1
tears, 1
at, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
portrait;, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
know, 1
this,, 1
how, 1
much, 1
must, 1
you, 1
suffer!", 1

Beauchamp,, 1
taking, 1
both, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
"take, 1
courage,, 1
my, 1
friend.", 1
"But, 1
how, 1
came, 1
that, 1
first, 1
note, 1
to, 1
be, 1
inserted, 1
in, 1
your, 1
journal?, 1

unknown, 1
enemy--an, 1
invisible, 1
foe--has, 1
done, 1
this.", 1
"The, 1
more, 1
must, 1
you, 1
fortify, 1
yourself,, 1
Albert., 1
Let, 1
no, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
emotion, 1
be, 1
visible, 1
on, 1
your, 1
countenance,, 1
bear, 1
your, 1
grief, 1
as, 1
the, 1
cloud, 1
bears, 1
within, 1
it, 1
ruin, 1
and, 1
death--a, 1
fatal, 1
secret,, 1

storm, 1
bursts., 1

shall, 1

"You, 1
think,, 1
then,, 1
all, 1
is, 1
not, 1
over, 1
yet?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
horror-stricken., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
nothing,, 1

all, 1
things, 1
are, 1
possible., 1

the, 1
way"--, 1
"What?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
Beauchamp, 1
hesitated., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
now?", 1
"Because, 1
the, 1
rupture, 1
or, 1
fulfilment, 1
of, 1
this, 1
engagement, 1
is, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
person, 1
of, 1

"How?", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
whose, 1
brow, 1
reddened;, 1

"No.", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"the, 1
engagement, 1
is, 1
broken, 1
off.", 1
"Well,", 1

Beauchamp., 1
Then,, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
relapse, 1
into, 1
melancholy,, 1
"Let, 1

go, 1
out,, 1

arrived, 1
at, 1

Madeleine,--"Since, 1

to, 1
Albert,, 1
then, 1
remained, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
deep, 1
meditation., 1
But, 1
passing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
dispel, 1
his, 1
revery,, 1
he, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
twice, 1
and, 1
Bertuccio, 1
entered., 1
"Bertuccio,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
intend, 1
going, 1
this, 1
evening, 1
to, 1
Normandy,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1

the, 1
first, 1
station., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
will, 1
accompany, 1
me.", 1
Bertuccio, 1
obeyed, 1
and, 1
despatched, 1
a, 1
courier, 1
to, 1
Pontoise, 1
to, 1
say, 1
the, 1
travelling-carriage, 1
would, 1
arrive, 1
at, 1
six, 1
o'clock., 1
From, 1
Pontoise, 1
another, 1
express, 1
was, 1
sent, 1
to, 1
the, 1
next, 1
stage,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
six, 1
hours, 1
all, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
stationed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
were, 1
ready., 1
Before, 1
his, 1
departure,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Haidee's, 1
apartments,, 1
told, 1
her, 1
his, 1
intention,, 1
and, 1
resigned, 1
everything, 1
to, 1
her, 1
care., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
punctual., 1
The, 1
journey, 1
soon, 1
became, 1
interesting, 1
from, 1
its, 1
rapidity,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
no, 1
previous, 1
idea., 1
"Truly,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"with, 1
your, 1

out, 1
of, 1

whistled,, 1

the, 1
horses, 1

The, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thundering, 1
noise, 1
over, 1
the, 1
pavement,, 1

every, 1
one, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
dazzling, 1
meteor., 1
Ali,, 1
smiling,, 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
sound,, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1

with, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
spurred, 1

horses,, 1

This, 1

with, 1

black, 1
face, 1
and, 1
sparkling, 1

brow;, 1
"but, 1
where, 1

the, 1
count;, 1
"six, 1
years, 1

thirty-two, 1

to-night, 1

"Count,, 1
may, 1
I, 1

one, 1
idea, 1

you?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
that,, 1
next, 1

Albert., 1
Tell, 1
me,, 1
why, 1
does, 1
a, 1
steward, 1
rob, 1
his, 1

I, 1
suppose,, 1
it, 1

"Yes.", 1

are, 1
words, 1

close, 1

such, 1
was, 1
the, 1
count's, 1

The, 1
whole, 1
journey, 1
was, 1
performed, 1
with, 1
equal, 1
rapidity;, 1
the, 1
thirty-two, 1
horses,, 1
dispersed, 1
over, 1
seven, 1
stages,, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
to, 1
their, 1
destination, 1
in, 1
eight, 1
hours., 1
At, 1
midnight, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
gate, 1
of, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
park., 1
The, 1
porter, 1
was, 1
in, 1
attendance;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
apprised, 1
by, 1
the, 1
groom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
last, 1

of, 1

approach., 1
At, 1
half, 1
past, 1
two, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
Morcerf, 1
was, 1
conducted, 1
to, 1
his, 1
apartments,, 1
where, 1
a, 1
bath, 1
and, 1
supper, 1
were, 1
prepared., 1

servant, 1
who, 1
had, 1
travelled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1

on, 1
him;, 1
Baptistin,, 1
who, 1
rode, 1
in, 1
front,, 1
attended, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Albert, 1
bathed,, 1
took, 1
his, 1
supper,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed., 1
All, 1
night, 1
he, 1
was, 1
lulled, 1
by, 1
the, 1
melancholy, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
surf., 1
On, 1
rising,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
his, 1
window,, 1
which, 1
opened, 1
on, 1
a, 1
terrace,, 1
having, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
in, 1

at, 1
the, 1
back, 1

pretty, 1
park, 1
bounded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
small, 1
forest., 1
In, 1
a, 1
creek, 1
lay, 1
a, 1
little, 1
sloop,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
narrow, 1
keel, 1
and, 1
high, 1
masts,, 1
bearing, 1
on, 1
its, 1
flag, 1
the, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
arms, 1

were, 1
a, 1
mountain, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sea, 1
azure,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cross, 1
gules, 1
on, 1
the, 1
shield., 1
Around, 1
the, 1
schooner, 1
lay, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
small, 1
fishing-boats, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fishermen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
neighboring, 1
village,, 1

queen., 1
There,, 1

in, 1
every, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
stopped,, 1
if, 1
but, 1
for, 1
two, 1
days,, 1
luxury, 1
abounded, 1
and, 1
life, 1
went, 1
on, 1
with, 1
the, 1
utmost, 1
ease., 1
Albert, 1
found, 1
in, 1
his, 1
anteroom, 1
two, 1
guns,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
accoutrements, 1
for, 1
hunting;, 1
a, 1
lofty, 1
room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground-floor, 1
containing, 1
all, 1
the, 1
ingenious, 1
instruments, 1
the, 1
English--eminent, 1
in, 1
piscatory, 1
pursuits,, 1
since, 1
they, 1
are, 1
patient, 1
and, 1
sluggish--have, 1
invented, 1
for, 1
fishing., 1
The, 1
day, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
pursuing, 1
those, 1
exercises, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
excelled., 1
They, 1
killed, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
pheasants, 1
in, 1
the, 1
park,, 1
as, 1
many, 1
trout, 1
in, 1
the, 1
stream,, 1
dined, 1
in, 1
a, 1
summer-house, 1
overlooking, 1
the, 1
ocean,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
tea, 1
in, 1
the, 1
library., 1
Towards, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
third, 1
day., 1
Albert,, 1
completely, 1
exhausted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exercise, 1
which, 1
invigorated, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
was, 1
sleeping, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arm-chair, 1
near, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
designing, 1
with, 1
his, 1
architect, 1
the, 1
plan, 1
of, 1
a, 1
conservatory, 1
in, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
at, 1
full, 1
speed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
high, 1
road, 1
made, 1
Albert, 1
look, 1
up., 1
He, 1
was, 1
disagreeably, 1
surprised, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
own, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
brought,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
inconvenience, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Florentin, 1
here!", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
starting, 1
up;, 1
"is, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
ill?", 1
And, 1
he, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
watched, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
approach, 1
the, 1
valet,, 1
who, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
small, 1
sealed, 1
parcel, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
containing, 1
a, 1
newspaper, 1
and, 1
a, 1
letter., 1
"From, 1
whom, 1
is, 1
this?", 1
said, 1
he, 1
eagerly., 1
"From, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,", 1
replied, 1
Florentin., 1
"Did, 1
he, 1
send, 1
you?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir;, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
money, 1
for, 1
my, 1
journey,, 1
procured, 1
a, 1
horse,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
me, 1
promise, 1
not, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
till, 1
I, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come, 1
in, 1
fifteen, 1
hours.", 1
Albert, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
with, 1
fear,, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
shriek, 1
on, 1
reading, 1
the, 1
first, 1
line,, 1
and, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
paper., 1
His, 1
sight, 1
was, 1
dimmed,, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
sank, 1
under, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
had, 1
not, 1
Florentin, 1
supported, 1
him., 1
"Poor, 1
young, 1
man,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
then, 1
true, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sin, 1
of, 1
the, 1
father, 1
shall, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
the, 1
children, 1
to, 1
the, 1
third, 1
and, 1
fourth, 1
generation.", 1
Meanwhile, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
revived,, 1
and,, 1
continuing, 1
to, 1
read,, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
back, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
saying,, 1
"Florentin,, 1
is, 1
your, 1
horse, 1
fit, 1
to, 1
return, 1
immediately?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
lame, 1
post-horse.", 1
"In, 1
what, 1
state, 1
was, 1
the, 1
house, 1
when, 1
you, 1
left?", 1
"All, 1
was, 1
quiet,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
returning, 1
from, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp's,, 1
I, 1
found, 1
madame, 1
in, 1
tears:, 1
she, 1
had, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
know, 1
when, 1
you, 1
would, 1
return., 1
I, 1
told, 1
her, 1
my, 1
orders, 1
from, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp;, 1
she, 1
first, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
reflection,, 1
'Yes,, 1
go,, 1
Florentin,', 1
said, 1
she,, 1
'and, 1
may, 1
he, 1
come, 1
quickly.'", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
mother,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
return,, 1
and, 1
woe, 1
to, 1
the, 1
infamous, 1
wretch!, 1
But, 1
first, 1
of, 1
all, 1
I, 1
must, 1
get, 1
there.", 1
He, 1
went, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
room, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
had, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
transformation, 1
in, 1
his, 1
appearance., 1
His, 1
voice, 1
had, 1
become, 1
rough, 1
and, 1
hoarse;, 1
his, 1
face, 1
was, 1
furrowed, 1
with, 1
wrinkles;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
burned, 1
under, 1
the, 1
blue-veined, 1
lids,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
tottered, 1
like, 1
a, 1
drunken, 1
man., 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
for, 1
your, 1
hospitality,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
would, 1
gladly, 1
have, 1
enjoyed, 1
longer;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
must, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris.", 1
"What, 1
has, 1
happened?", 1
"A, 1
great, 1
misfortune,, 1
more, 1
important, 1
to, 1
me, 1
than, 1
life., 1
Don't, 1
question, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
of, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
lend, 1
me, 1
a, 1
horse.", 1
"My, 1
stables, 1
are, 1
at, 1
your, 1
command,, 1
viscount;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
will, 1
kill, 1
yourself, 1
by, 1
riding, 1
on, 1
horseback., 1
Take, 1
a, 1
post-chaise, 1
or, 1
a, 1
carriage.", 1
"No,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
delay, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
need, 1
the, 1
fatigue, 1
you, 1
warn, 1
me, 1
of;, 1
it, 1
will, 1
do, 1
me, 1
good.", 1
Albert, 1
reeled, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
shot,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair, 1
near, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
this, 1
second, 1
manifestation, 1
of, 1
physical, 1
exhaustion;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
calling,, 1
"Ali,, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
for, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf--quick!, 1
he, 1
is, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hurry!", 1
These, 1
words, 1
restored, 1
Albert;, 1
he, 1
darted, 1
from, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Thank, 1
you!", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
throwing, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
horse., 1
"Return, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
you, 1
can,, 1
Florentin., 1
Must, 1
I, 1
use, 1
any, 1
password, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
a, 1
horse?", 1
"Only, 1
dismount;, 1
another, 1
will, 1
be, 1
immediately, 1
saddled.", 1
Albert, 1
hesitated, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"You, 1
may, 1
think, 1
my, 1
departure, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
foolish,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
how, 1
a, 1
paragraph, 1
in, 1
a, 1
newspaper, 1
may, 1
exasperate, 1
one., 1
Read, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"when, 1
I, 1
am, 1
gone,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
witness, 1
of, 1
my, 1
anger.", 1
While, 1
the, 1
count, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
he, 1
put, 1
spurs, 1
to, 1
his, 1
horse,, 1
which, 1
leaped, 1
in, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
such, 1
an, 1
unusual, 1
stimulus,, 1
and, 1
shot, 1
away, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rapidity, 1
of, 1
an, 1
arrow., 1
The, 1
count, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
compassion,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
had, 1
completely, 1
disappeared,, 1
read, 1
as, 1
follows:--, 1
"The, 1
French, 1
officer, 1
in, 1
the, 1
service, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Pasha, 1
of, 1
Yanina, 1
alluded, 1
to, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
since, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Impartial,, 1
who, 1
not, 1
only, 1
surrendered, 1
the, 1
castle, 1
of, 1
Yanina,, 1
but, 1
sold, 1
his, 1
benefactor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Turks,, 1
styled, 1
himself, 1
truly, 1
at, 1
that, 1
time, 1
Fernand,, 1
as, 1
our, 1
esteemed, 1
contemporary, 1
states;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
has, 1
since, 1
added, 1
to, 1
his, 1
Christian, 1
name, 1
a, 1
title, 1
of, 1
nobility, 1
and, 1
a, 1
family, 1
name., 1
He, 1
now, 1
calls, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
and, 1
ranks, 1
among, 1
the, 1
peers.", 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
secret,, 1
which, 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
so, 1
generously, 1
destroyed,, 1
appeared, 1
again, 1
like, 1
an, 1
armed, 1
phantom;, 1
and, 1
another, 1
paper,, 1
deriving, 1
its, 1
information, 1
from, 1
some, 1
malicious, 1
source,, 1
had, 1
published, 1
two, 1
days, 1
after, 1
Albert's, 1
departure, 1
for, 1
Normandy, 1
the, 1
few, 1
lines, 1
which, 1
had, 1
rendered, 1
the, 1
unfortunate, 1
young, 1
man, 1
almost, 1
crazy., 1
Chapter, 1
86., 1
The, 1
Trial., 1
At, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
door., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
had, 1
received, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
usher, 1
him, 1
in, 1
at, 1
once., 1
Beauchamp, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bath., 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
friend,", 1
replied, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"I, 1
expected, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
say, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
are, 1
too, 1
faithful, 1
and, 1
too, 1
kind, 1
to, 1
have, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
that, 1
painful, 1
circumstance., 1
Your, 1
having, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me, 1
is, 1
another, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
your, 1
affection., 1
So,, 1
without, 1
losing, 1
time,, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
idea, 1
whence, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
blow, 1
proceeds?", 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
have, 1
some, 1
clew.", 1
"But, 1
first, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
all, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
of, 1
this, 1
shameful, 1
plot.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
proceeded, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
shame, 1
and, 1
grief,, 1
the, 1
following, 1
facts., 1
Two, 1
days, 1
previously,, 1
the, 1
article, 1
had, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
another, 1
paper, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
Impartial,, 1
and,, 1
what, 1
was, 1
more, 1
serious,, 1
one, 1
that, 1
was, 1
well, 1
known, 1
as, 1
a, 1
government, 1
paper., 1
Beauchamp, 1
was, 1
breakfasting, 1
when, 1
he, 1
read, 1
the, 1
paragraph., 1
He, 1
sent, 1
immediately, 1
for, 1
a, 1
cabriolet,, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
the, 1
publisher's, 1
office., 1
Although, 1
professing, 1
diametrically, 1
opposite, 1
principles, 1
from, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
editor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other, 1
paper,, 1
Beauchamp--as, 1
it, 1
sometimes,, 1
we, 1
may, 1
say, 1
often,, 1
happens--was, 1
his, 1
intimate, 1
friend., 1
The, 1
editor, 1
was, 1
reading,, 1
with, 1
apparent, 1
delight,, 1
a, 1
leading, 1
article, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
paper, 1
on, 1
beet-sugar,, 1
probably, 1
a, 1
composition, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own., 1
"Ah,, 1
pardieu,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"with, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
in, 1
your, 1
hand,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
visit.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sugar, 1
question?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
editor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ministerial, 1
paper., 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
question;, 1
a, 1
totally, 1
different, 1
subject, 1
interests, 1
me.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"The, 1
article, 1
relative, 1
to, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
a, 1
curious, 1
affair?", 1
"So, 1
curious,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
are, 1
running, 1
a, 1
great, 1
risk, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prosecution, 1
for, 1
defamation, 1
of, 1
character.", 1
"Not, 1
at, 1
all;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
received, 1
with, 1
the, 1
information, 1
all, 1
the, 1
requisite, 1
proofs,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
are, 1
quite, 1
sure, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
will, 1
not, 1
raise, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
against, 1
us;, 1
besides,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
rendering, 1
a, 1
service, 1
to, 1
one's, 1
country, 1
to, 1
denounce, 1
these, 1
wretched, 1
criminals, 1
who, 1
are, 1
unworthy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
bestowed, 1
on, 1
them.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
was, 1
thunderstruck., 1
"Who,, 1
then,, 1
has, 1
so, 1
correctly, 1
informed, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
he;, 1
"for, 1
my, 1
paper,, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
first, 1
information, 1
on, 1
the, 1
subject,, 1
has, 1
been, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
stop, 1
for, 1
want, 1
of, 1
proof;, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
we, 1
are, 1
more, 1
interested, 1
than, 1
you, 1
in, 1
exposing, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
is, 1
a, 1
peer, 1
of, 1
France,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
are, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opposition.", 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
very, 1
simple;, 1
we, 1
have, 1
not, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
scandalize., 1
This, 1
news, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
us., 1
A, 1
man, 1
arrived, 1
yesterday, 1
from, 1
Yanina,, 1
bringing, 1
a, 1
formidable, 1
array, 1
of, 1
documents;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
we, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
publish, 1
the, 1
accusatory, 1
article,, 1
he, 1
told, 1
us, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
inserted, 1
in, 1
some, 1
other, 1
paper.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
nothing, 1
remained, 1
but, 1
to, 1
submit,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
the, 1
office, 1
to, 1
despatch, 1
a, 1
courier, 1
to, 1
Morcerf., 1
But, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
send, 1
to, 1
Albert, 1
the, 1
following, 1
particulars,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
events, 1
had, 1
transpired, 1
after, 1
the, 1
messenger's, 1
departure;, 1
namely,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
same, 1
day, 1
a, 1
great, 1
agitation, 1
was, 1
manifest, 1
in, 1
the, 1
House, 1
of, 1
Peers, 1
among, 1
the, 1
usually, 1
calm, 1
members, 1
of, 1
that, 1
dignified, 1
assembly., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
almost, 1
before, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
conversing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
melancholy, 1
event, 1
which, 1
was, 1
to, 1
attract, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
the, 1
public, 1
towards, 1
one, 1
of, 1
their, 1
most, 1
illustrious, 1
colleagues., 1
Some, 1
were, 1
perusing, 1
the, 1
article,, 1
others, 1
making, 1
comments, 1
and, 1
recalling, 1
circumstances, 1
which, 1
substantiated, 1
the, 1
charges, 1
still, 1
more., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
was, 1
no, 1
favorite, 1
with, 1
his, 1
colleagues., 1
Like, 1
all, 1
upstarts,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
had, 1
recourse, 1
to, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
haughtiness, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
his, 1
position., 1
The, 1
true, 1
nobility, 1
laughed, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
the, 1
talented, 1
repelled, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
honorable, 1
instinctively, 1
despised, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
position, 1
of, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
marked, 1
for, 1
sacrifice;, 1
the, 1
finger, 1
of, 1
God, 1
once, 1
pointed, 1
at, 1
him,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
was, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
the, 1
hue, 1
and, 1
cry., 1
The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
alone, 1
was, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
news., 1
He, 1
did, 1
not, 1
take, 1
in, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
containing, 1
the, 1
defamatory, 1
article,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
in, 1
writing, 1
letters, 1
and, 1
in, 1
trying, 1
a, 1
horse., 1
He, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
hour,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
proud, 1
look, 1
and, 1
insolent, 1
demeanor;, 1
he, 1
alighted,, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
corridors,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
house, 1
without, 1
observing, 1
the, 1
hesitation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door-keepers, 1
or, 1
the, 1
coolness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
colleagues., 1
Business, 1
had, 1
already, 1
been, 1
going, 1
on, 1
for, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
when, 1
he, 1
entered., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
held, 1
the, 1
accusing, 1
paper,, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
liked, 1
to, 1
take, 1
upon, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
responsibility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
attack., 1
At, 1
length, 1
an, 1
honorable, 1
peer,, 1
Morcerf's, 1
acknowledged, 1
enemy,, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
tribune, 1
with, 1
that, 1
solemnity, 1
which, 1
announced, 1
that, 1
the, 1
expected, 1
moment, 1
had, 1
arrived., 1
There, 1
was, 1
an, 1
impressive, 1
silence;, 1
Morcerf, 1
alone, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
why, 1
such, 1
profound, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
an, 1
orator, 1
who, 1
was, 1
not, 1
always, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
complacency., 1
The, 1
count, 1
did, 1
not, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
introduction,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
speaker, 1
announced, 1
that, 1
his, 1
communication, 1
would, 1
be, 1
of, 1
that, 1
vital, 1
importance, 1
that, 1
it, 1
demanded, 1
the, 1
undivided, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
the, 1
House;, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
Yanina, 1
and, 1
Colonel, 1
Fernand,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
so, 1
frightfully, 1
pale, 1
that, 1
every, 1
member, 1
shuddered, 1
and, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
Moral, 1
wounds, 1
have, 1
this, 1
peculiarity,--they, 1
may, 1
be, 1
hidden,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
never, 1
close;, 1
always, 1
painful,, 1
always, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
bleed, 1
when, 1
touched,, 1
they, 1
remain, 1
fresh, 1
and, 1
open, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
The, 1
article, 1
having, 1
been, 1
read, 1
during, 1
the, 1
painful, 1
hush, 1
that, 1
followed,, 1
a, 1
universal, 1
shudder, 1
pervaded, 1
the, 1
assembly,, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
the, 1
closest, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
the, 1
orator, 1
as, 1
he, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
remarks., 1
He, 1
stated, 1
his, 1
scruples, 1
and, 1
the, 1
difficulties, 1
of, 1
the, 1
case;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
House,, 1
he, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
defend,, 1
by, 1
provoking, 1
a, 1
debate, 1
on, 1
personal, 1
questions,, 1
which, 1
are, 1
always, 1
such, 1
painful, 1
themes, 1
of, 1
discussion., 1
He, 1
concluded, 1
by, 1
calling, 1
for, 1
an, 1
investigation,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
dispose, 1
of, 1
the, 1
calumnious, 1
report, 1
before, 1
it, 1
had, 1
time, 1
to, 1
spread,, 1
and, 1
restore, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
to, 1
the, 1
position, 1
he, 1
had, 1
long, 1
held, 1
in, 1
public, 1
opinion., 1
Morcerf, 1
was, 1
so, 1
completely, 1
overwhelmed, 1
by, 1
this, 1
great, 1
and, 1
unexpected, 1
calamity, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
stammer, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
as, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
on, 1
the, 1
assembly., 1
This, 1
timidity,, 1
which, 1
might, 1
proceed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
astonishment, 1
of, 1
innocence, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
shame, 1
of, 1
guilt,, 1
conciliated, 1
some, 1
in, 1
his, 1
favor;, 1
for, 1
men, 1
who, 1
are, 1
truly, 1
generous, 1
are, 1
always, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
compassionate, 1
when, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
of, 1
their, 1
enemy, 1
surpasses, 1
the, 1
limits, 1
of, 1
their, 1
hatred., 1
The, 1
president, 1
put, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
vote,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
decided, 1
that, 1
the, 1
investigation, 1
should, 1
take, 1
place., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
asked, 1
what, 1
time, 1
he, 1
required, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
his, 1
defence., 1
Morcerf's, 1
courage, 1
had, 1
revived, 1
when, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
alive, 1
after, 1
this, 1
horrible, 1
blow., 1
"My, 1
lords,", 1
answered, 1
he,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
by, 1
time, 1
I, 1
could, 1
repel, 1
the, 1
attack, 1
made, 1
on, 1
me, 1
by, 1
enemies, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
and,, 1
doubtless,, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
obscurity;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
immediately,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
must, 1
repel, 1
the, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
lightning, 1
which,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
startled, 1
me., 1
Oh,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
this, 1
defence,, 1
shed, 1
my, 1
last, 1
drop, 1
of, 1
blood, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
my, 1
noble, 1
colleagues, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
their, 1
equal, 1
in, 1
worth.", 1
These, 1
words, 1
made, 1
a, 1
favorable, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
behalf, 1
of, 1
the, 1
accused., 1
"I, 1
demand,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
examination, 1
shall, 1
take, 1
place, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
furnish, 1
the, 1
house, 1
with, 1
all, 1
necessary, 1
information.", 1
"What, 1
day, 1
do, 1
you, 1
fix?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"To-day, 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
The, 1
president, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell., 1
"Does, 1
the, 1
House, 1
approve, 1
that, 1
the, 1
examination, 1
should, 1
take, 1
place, 1
to-day?", 1
"Yes,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
unanimous, 1
answer., 1
A, 1
committee, 1
of, 1
twelve, 1
members, 1
was, 1
chosen, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
proofs, 1
brought, 1
forward, 1
by, 1
Morcerf., 1
The, 1
investigation, 1
would, 1
begin, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
that, 1
evening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
committee-room,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
postponement, 1
were, 1
necessary,, 1
the, 1
proceedings, 1
would, 1
be, 1
resumed, 1
each, 1
evening, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hour., 1
Morcerf, 1
asked, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
retire;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
collect, 1
the, 1
documents, 1
he, 1
had, 1
long, 1
been, 1
preparing, 1
against, 1
this, 1
storm,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
sagacity, 1
had, 1
foreseen., 1
Albert, 1
listened,, 1
trembling, 1
now, 1
with, 1
hope,, 1
then, 1
with, 1
anger,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
again, 1
with, 1
shame,, 1
for, 1
from, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
confidence, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
his, 1
father, 1
was, 1
guilty,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
asked, 1
himself, 1
how,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
was, 1
guilty,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
prove, 1
his, 1
innocence., 1
Beauchamp, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
continue, 1
his, 1
narrative., 1
"What, 1
next?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"What, 1
next?, 1
My, 1
friend,, 1
you, 1
impose, 1
a, 1
painful, 1
task, 1
on, 1
me., 1
Must, 1
you, 1
know, 1
all?", 1
"Absolutely;, 1
and, 1
rather, 1
from, 1
your, 1
lips, 1
than, 1
another's.", 1
"Muster, 1
up, 1
all, 1
your, 1
courage,, 1
then,, 1
for, 1
never, 1
have, 1
you, 1
required, 1
it, 1
more.", 1
Albert, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
try, 1
his, 1
strength,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
is, 1
preparing, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
his, 1
life, 1
proves, 1
his, 1
shield, 1
and, 1
bends, 1
his, 1
sword., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
himself, 1
strong, 1
enough,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
mistook, 1
fever, 1
for, 1
energy., 1
"Go, 1
on,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"The, 1
evening, 1
arrived;, 1
all, 1
Paris, 1
was, 1
in, 1
expectation., 1
Many, 1
said, 1
your, 1
father, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
show, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
crush, 1
the, 1
charge, 1
against, 1
him;, 1
many, 1
others, 1
said, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
appear;, 1
while, 1
some, 1
asserted, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
start, 1
for, 1
Brussels;, 1
and, 1
others, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
police-office, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
out, 1
a, 1
passport., 1
I, 1
used, 1
all, 1
my, 1
influence, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
committee,, 1
a, 1
young, 1
peer, 1
of, 1
my, 1
acquaintance,, 1
to, 1
get, 1
admission, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
galleries., 1
He, 1
called, 1
for, 1
me, 1
at, 1
seven, 1
o'clock,, 1
and,, 1
before, 1
any, 1
one, 1
had, 1
arrived,, 1
asked, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door-keepers, 1
to, 1
place, 1
me, 1
in, 1
a, 1
box., 1
I, 1
was, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
column,, 1
and, 1
might, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
scene, 1
which, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place., 1
At, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
all, 1
were, 1
in, 1
their, 1
places,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
entered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
last, 1
stroke., 1
He, 1
held, 1
some, 1
papers, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
was, 1
calm,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
step, 1
firm,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
great, 1
care, 1
in, 1
his, 1
military, 1
uniform,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
buttoned, 1
completely, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
chin., 1
His, 1
presence, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
good, 1
effect., 1
The, 1
committee, 1
was, 1
made, 1
up, 1
of, 1
Liberals,, 1
several, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
came, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
him.", 1
Albert, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
bursting, 1
at, 1
these, 1
particulars,, 1
but, 1
gratitude, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sorrow:, 1
he, 1
would, 1
gladly, 1
have, 1
embraced, 1
those, 1
who, 1
had, 1
given, 1
his, 1
father, 1
this, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
esteem, 1
at, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
his, 1
honor, 1
was, 1
so, 1
powerfully, 1
attacked., 1
"At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door-keepers, 1
brought, 1
in, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
for, 1
the, 1
president., 1
'You, 1
are, 1
at, 1
liberty, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
unsealed, 1
the, 1
letter;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
began, 1
his, 1
defence,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
Albert,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
most, 1
eloquent, 1
and, 1
skilful, 1
manner., 1
He, 1
produced, 1
documents, 1
proving, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Vizier, 1
of, 1
Yanina, 1
had, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
last, 1
moment, 1
honored, 1
him, 1
with, 1
his, 1
entire, 1
confidence,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
had, 1
interested, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
negotiation, 1
of, 1
life, 1
and, 1
death, 1
with, 1
the, 1
emperor., 1
He, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
ring,, 1
his, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
authority,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Ali, 1
Pasha, 1
generally, 1
sealed, 1
his, 1
letters,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
had, 1
given, 1
him,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return, 1
at, 1
any, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
or, 1
night,, 1
gain, 1
access, 1
to, 1
the, 1
presence,, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1
harem., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
the, 1
negotiation, 1
failed,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
his, 1
benefactor,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
'But,', 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
'so, 1
great, 1
was, 1
Ali, 1
Pasha's, 1
confidence,, 1
that, 1
on, 1
his, 1
death-bed, 1
he, 1
resigned, 1
his, 1
favorite, 1
mistress, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
to, 1
my, 1
care.'", 1
Albert, 1
started, 1
on, 1
hearing, 1
these, 1
words;, 1
the, 1
history, 1
of, 1
Haidee, 1
recurred, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
what, 1
she, 1
had, 1
said, 1
of, 1
that, 1
message, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ring,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
been, 1
sold, 1
and, 1
made, 1
a, 1
slave., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
effect, 1
did, 1
this, 1
discourse, 1
produce?", 1
anxiously, 1
inquired, 1
Albert., 1
"I, 1
acknowledge, 1
it, 1
affected, 1
me,, 1
and,, 1
indeed,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
committee, 1
also,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Meanwhile,, 1
the, 1
president, 1
carelessly, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
first, 1
lines, 1
aroused, 1
his, 1
attention;, 1
he, 1
read, 1
them, 1
again, 1
and, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
'Count,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'you, 1
have, 1
said, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Vizier, 1
of, 1
Yanina, 1

wife, 1
and, 1
daughter, 1
to, 1

replied, 1
Morcerf;, 1
'but, 1
in, 1
that,, 1

pursued, 1
me., 1
On, 1
my, 1
return,, 1
Vasiliki, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
Haidee, 1

disappeared.'--'Did, 1
you, 1
know, 1
them?'--'My, 1
intimacy, 1
with, 1
the, 1
pasha, 1
and, 1
his, 1
unlimited, 1
confidence, 1
had, 1
gained, 1
me, 1
an, 1
introduction, 1
to, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
them, 1
above, 1
twenty, 1
times.', 1
"'Have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
idea, 1
what, 1
became, 1
of, 1
them?'--'Yes,, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
they, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
victims, 1
to, 1
their, 1
sorrow,, 1

perhaps,, 1
to, 1
their, 1
poverty., 1
I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
rich;, 1
my, 1
life, 1
was, 1
in, 1
constant, 1
danger;, 1
I, 1
could, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
them,, 1
to, 1
my, 1
great, 1
regret.', 1
The, 1
president, 1
frowned, 1
imperceptibly., 1
'Gentlemen,', 1
said, 1
he,, 1
'you, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
Comte, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's, 1

Can, 1

produce, 1
any, 1

replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1

murmur, 1
of, 1
approbation, 1

through, 1

at, 1

all, 1

thus, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1

learned, 1
what, 1

this, 1
morning, 1
in, 1

word, 1
fell, 1
like, 1

dagger, 1
on, 1

terror., 1

the, 1

violent, 1
temper;, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
blow, 1
which, 1
would, 1
deprive, 1
him, 1
of, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
defend, 1
himself., 1
They, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
his, 1
stupefied, 1
silence, 1
would, 1
be, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
fiery, 1
outburst., 1

"'I, 1

The, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
might, 1
have, 1
softened, 1
tigers,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
disarm, 1
his, 1
judges., 1

he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
ceiling,, 1

withdrew, 1
then,, 1
immediately,, 1

with, 1
a, 1

he, 1
tore, 1
open, 1

to, 1

flew, 1
from, 1

to, 1

to, 1
human, 1

material, 1
existence,, 1

profess, 1
to, 1

that, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
blow.", 1

you, 1
will, 1

will, 1

you,, 1

Beauchamp,, 1
that, 1

is, 1
an, 1

punished,, 1

on, 1

sent, 1
for, 1
a, 1
cabriolet., 1

entering, 1

servant, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti., 1

parbleu,, 1
that's, 1
good,", 1

gloomy, 1
tone., 1

servant, 1

the, 1
banker,, 1

what, 1
had, 1
transpired, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before,, 1
did, 1
not, 1

was,, 1

too, 1
late;, 1

had, 1
followed, 1

footman,, 1
and,, 1

order, 1
given,, 1
forced, 1
the, 1
door, 1

followed, 1
by, 1

himself, 1
in, 1

banker's, 1
study., 1
"Sir,", 1

Albert,, 1
coldly;, 1

is, 1
your, 1
errand,, 1

with, 1
me,, 1

mean,", 1

Albert,, 1
drawing, 1
near,, 1

without, 1

stood, 1
with, 1
his, 1
back, 1
towards, 1

ten, 1
minutes;, 1

will, 1
be, 1
sufficient--where, 1
two, 1
men, 1

met,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
them, 1

Danglars, 1
turned, 1
pale;, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
moved, 1
a, 1
step, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
"And, 1
you,, 1
too,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"come,, 1
if, 1
you, 1

willing, 1
to, 1

Cavalcanti, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
a, 1
stupefied, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
making, 1
an, 1
effort,, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
stepped, 1
between, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men., 1
Albert's, 1
attack, 1
on, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
him, 1
on, 1
a, 1
different, 1
footing,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
this, 1
visit, 1
had, 1
another, 1
cause, 1
than, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
at, 1
first, 1
supposed., 1
"Indeed,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
come, 1
to, 1
quarrel, 1
with, 1

attorney.", 1
"You, 1
mistake,, 1

Morcerf, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
smile;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
referring, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
to, 1
matrimony,, 1

only, 1
addressed, 1
myself, 1

appeared, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1

one, 1
respect, 1

are, 1

ready, 1
to, 1

have, 1
the, 1
first, 1
claim,, 1

"Sir,", 1
replied, 1
Danglars,, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
anger, 1
and, 1
fear,, 1
"I, 1
warn, 1
you,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mad, 1
dog,, 1

kill, 1
it;, 1

far, 1
from, 1

myself, 1
guilty, 1
of, 1
a, 1
crime,, 1

believe, 1

do, 1
society, 1

are, 1
mad, 1
and, 1
try, 1
to, 1
bite, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
kill, 1
you, 1
without, 1
pity., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
my, 1
fault, 1
that, 1
your, 1

has, 1
dishonored, 1
himself?", 1
"Yes,, 1
miserable, 1
wretch!", 1
cried, 1
Morcerf,, 1

steps., 1

must, 1

affair?, 1

father, 1
to, 1
sell, 1

castle, 1
of, 1
Yanina--to, 1

Albert,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
thundering, 1
voice., 1
"No;, 1

not, 1
you, 1

"Yes;, 1

with, 1
a, 1
confidence, 1

security, 1

less, 1
from, 1
fear, 1

from, 1
the, 1

really, 1
felt, 1
for, 1

it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
most, 1
simple, 1
thing, 1
in, 1

"Yes;, 1
I, 1
showed, 1
it, 1
to, 1
him.", 1
"Did, 1
he, 1
know, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
Christian, 1
name, 1
was, 1
Fernand,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
family, 1
name, 1
Mondego?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
told, 1
him, 1
that, 1
long, 1
since,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
did, 1
only, 1
what, 1
any, 1
other, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
in, 1
my, 1
circumstances,, 1
and, 1
perhaps, 1
less., 1
When,, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
this, 1
answer,, 1
your, 1
father, 1
came, 1
by, 1
the, 1
advice, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
my, 1
daughter's, 1
hand, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
decidedly, 1
refused, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
any, 1
explanation, 1
or, 1
exposure., 1
In, 1
short,, 1
why, 1
should, 1
I, 1
have, 1
any, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
the, 1
affair?, 1
How, 1
did, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
or, 1
disgrace, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
affect, 1
me?, 1
It, 1
neither, 1
increased, 1
nor, 1
decreased, 1
my, 1
income.", 1
Albert, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
mounting, 1
to, 1
his, 1
brow;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
Danglars, 1
defended, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
the, 1
baseness,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
with, 1
the, 1
assurance,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
speaks, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
in, 1
part,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
wholly--not, 1
for, 1
conscience', 1
sake,, 1
but, 1
through, 1
fear., 1
Besides,, 1
what, 1
was, 1
Morcerf, 1
seeking?, 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
whether, 1
Danglars, 1
or, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
more, 1
or, 1
less, 1
guilty;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
would, 1
answer, 1
for, 1
the, 1
offence,, 1
whether, 1
trifling, 1
or, 1
serious;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
would, 1
fight,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
Danglars, 1
would, 1
not, 1
fight., 1
And,, 1
in, 1
addition, 1
to, 1
this,, 1
everything, 1
forgotten, 1
or, 1
unperceived, 1
before, 1
presented, 1
itself, 1
now, 1
to, 1
his, 1
recollection., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
knew, 1
everything,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
bought, 1
the, 1
daughter, 1
of, 1
Ali, 1
Pasha;, 1
and,, 1
knowing, 1
everything,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
advised, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
write, 1
to, 1
Yanina., 1
The, 1
answer, 1
known,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
Albert's, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
introduced, 1
to, 1
Haidee,, 1
and, 1
allowed, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
on, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
not, 1
opposed, 1
Haidee's, 1
recital, 1
(but, 1
having,, 1
doubtless,, 1
warned, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
few, 1
Romaic, 1
words, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
not, 1
to, 1
implicate, 1
Morcerf's, 1
father)., 1
Besides,, 1
had, 1
he, 1
not, 1
begged, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
not, 1
to, 1
mention, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
name, 1
before, 1
Haidee?, 1
Lastly,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
Albert, 1
to, 1
Normandy, 1
when, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
final, 1
blow, 1
was, 1
near., 1
There, 1
could, 1
be, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
all, 1
had, 1
been, 1
calculated, 1
and, 1
previously, 1
arranged;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
then, 1
was, 1
in, 1
league, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
enemies., 1
Albert, 1
took, 1
Beauchamp, 1
aside,, 1
and, 1
communicated, 1
these, 1
ideas, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
latter;, 1
"M., 1
Danglars, 1
has, 1
only, 1
been, 1
a, 1
secondary, 1
agent, 1
in, 1
this, 1
sad, 1
affair,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
that, 1
you, 1
must, 1
demand, 1
an, 1
explanation.", 1
Albert, 1
turned., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Danglars,, 1
"understand, 1
that, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
take, 1
a, 1
final, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
you;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
ascertain, 1
if, 1
your, 1
insinuations, 1
are, 1
just,, 1
and, 1
am, 1
going, 1
now, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
He, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
out, 1
with, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
without, 1
appearing, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
Danglars, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
again, 1
assured, 1
Albert, 1
that, 1
no, 1
motive, 1
of, 1
personal, 1
hatred, 1
had, 1
influenced, 1
him, 1
against, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf., 1
Chapter, 1
88., 1
The, 1
Insult., 1
At, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
door, 1
Beauchamp, 1
stopped, 1
Morcerf., 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"just, 1
now, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
it, 1
was, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
you, 1
must, 1
demand, 1
an, 1
explanation.", 1
"Yes;, 1
and, 1
we, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
his, 1
house.", 1
"Reflect,, 1
Morcerf,, 1
one, 1
moment, 1
before, 1
you, 1
go.", 1
"On, 1
what, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
reflect?", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
importance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
step, 1
you, 1
are, 1
taking.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
more, 1
serious, 1
than, 1
going, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Danglars?", 1
"Yes;, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
a, 1
money-lover,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
who, 1
love, 1
money,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
think, 1
too, 1
much, 1
of, 1
what, 1
they, 1
risk, 1
to, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
induced, 1
to, 1
fight, 1
a, 1
duel., 1
The, 1
other, 1
is,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
to, 1
all, 1
appearance, 1
a, 1
true, 1
nobleman;, 1
but, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
fear, 1
to, 1
find, 1
him, 1
a, 1
bully?", 1
"I, 1
only, 1
fear, 1
one, 1
thing;, 1
namely,, 1
to, 1
find, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
will, 1
not, 1
fight.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"he, 1
will, 1
meet, 1
you., 1
My, 1
only, 1
fear, 1
is, 1
that, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
too, 1
strong, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Morcerf,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
smile,, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
what, 1
I, 1
wish., 1
The, 1
happiest, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
could, 1
occur, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
would, 1
be, 1
to, 1
die, 1
in, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
stead;, 1
that, 1
would, 1
save, 1
us, 1
all.", 1
"Your, 1
mother, 1
would, 1
die, 1
of, 1
grief.", 1
"My, 1
poor, 1
mother!", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
passing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
she, 1
would;, 1
but, 1
better, 1
so, 1
than, 1
die, 1
of, 1
shame.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
quite, 1
decided,, 1
Albert?", 1
"Yes;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
go.", 1
"But, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
find, 1
the, 1
count, 1
at, 1
home?", 1
"He, 1
intended, 1
returning, 1
some, 1
hours, 1
after, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
doubtless, 1
he, 1
is, 1
now, 1
at, 1
home.", 1
They, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
driver, 1
to, 1
take, 1
them, 1
to, 1
No., 1
30, 1
Champs-Elysees., 1
Beauchamp, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
go, 1
in, 1
alone,, 1
but, 1
Albert, 1
observed, 1
that, 1
as, 1
this, 1
was, 1
an, 1
unusual, 1
circumstance, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
deviate, 1
from, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
etiquette, 1
in, 1
affairs, 1
of, 1
honor., 1
The, 1
cause, 1
which, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
espoused, 1
was, 1
one, 1
so, 1
sacred, 1
that, 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
all, 1
his, 1
wishes;, 1
he, 1
yielded, 1
and, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
following, 1
Morcerf., 1
Albert, 1
sprang, 1
from, 1
the, 1
porter's, 1
lodge, 1
to, 1
the, 1
steps., 1
He, 1
was, 1
received, 1
by, 1
Baptistin., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had,, 1
indeed,, 1
just, 1
arrived,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
bath,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
forbidden, 1
that, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
be, 1
admitted., 1
"But, 1
after, 1
his, 1
bath?", 1
asked, 1
Morcerf., 1
"My, 1
master, 1
will, 1
go, 1
to, 1
dinner.", 1
"And, 1
after, 1
dinner?", 1
"He, 1
will, 1
sleep, 1
an, 1
hour.", 1
"Then?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opera.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
Albert., 1
"Quite,, 1
sir;, 1
my, 1
master, 1
has, 1
ordered, 1
his, 1
horses, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
precisely.", 1
"Very, 1
good,", 1
replied, 1
Albert;, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
know.", 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"If, 1
you, 1
have, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
to,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
do, 1
it, 1
directly;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
have, 1
any, 1
appointment, 1
for, 1
this, 1
evening,, 1
defer, 1
it, 1
till, 1
tomorrow., 1
I, 1
depend, 1
on, 1
you, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opera;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
can,, 1
bring, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
availed, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
Albert's, 1
permission,, 1
and, 1
left, 1
him,, 1
promising, 1
to, 1
call, 1
for, 1
him, 1
at, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
before, 1
eight., 1
On, 1
his, 1
return, 1
home,, 1
Albert, 1
expressed, 1
his, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
Franz, 1
Debray,, 1
and, 1
Morrel,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
them, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
that, 1
evening., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
see, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
who, 1
since, 1
the, 1
events, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before, 1
had, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
see, 1
any, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
her, 1
room., 1
He, 1
found, 1
her, 1
in, 1
bed,, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
grief, 1
at, 1
this, 1
public, 1
humiliation., 1
The, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
Albert, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
which, 1
might, 1
naturally, 1
be, 1
expected, 1
on, 1
Mercedes;, 1
she, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
sobbed, 1
aloud,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
tears, 1
relieved, 1
her., 1
Albert, 1
stood, 1
one, 1
moment, 1
speechless, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
bed., 1
It, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
face, 1
and, 1
knit, 1
brows, 1
that, 1
his, 1
resolution, 1
to, 1
revenge, 1
himself, 1
was, 1
growing, 1
weaker., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
mother,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
if, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
has, 1
any, 1
enemy?", 1
Mercedes, 1
started;, 1
she, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
did, 1
not, 1
say, 1
"my, 1
father.", 1
"My, 1
son,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"persons, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
situation, 1
have, 1
many, 1
secret, 1
enemies., 1
Those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
known, 1
are, 1
not, 1
the, 1
most, 1
dangerous.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1

appeal, 1
to, 1
your, 1
penetration., 1
You, 1
are, 1
of, 1
so, 1
superior, 1
a, 1
mind,, 1
nothing, 1
escapes, 1
you.", 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say, 1
so?", 1
"Because,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
you, 1
noticed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
we, 1
gave,, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
would, 1
eat, 1
nothing, 1
in, 1
our, 1
house.", 1
Mercedes, 1
raised, 1
herself, 1
on, 1
her, 1
feverish, 1
arm., 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo!", 1
she, 1
exclaimed;, 1
"and, 1
how, 1
is, 1
he, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
question, 1
you, 1
asked, 1
me?", 1
"You, 1
know,, 1
mother,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
an, 1
Oriental,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
customary, 1
with, 1
the, 1
Orientals, 1
to, 1
secure, 1
full, 1
liberty, 1
for, 1
revenge, 1
by, 1
not, 1
eating, 1
or, 1
drinking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
houses, 1
of, 1
their, 1
enemies.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
say, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
is, 1
our, 1
enemy?", 1
replied, 1
Mercedes,, 1
becoming, 1
paler, 1
than, 1
the, 1
sheet, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
her., 1
"Who, 1
told, 1
you, 1
so?, 1
Why,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
mad,, 1
Albert!, 1
M., 1
de, 1

Oh,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
son,, 1

you, 1
had, 1
entertained, 1
such, 1
an, 1
idea,, 1
dispel, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
my, 1
counsel, 1
to, 1
you--nay,, 1
my, 1
prayer--is, 1
to, 1
retain, 1
his, 1
friendship.", 1
"Mother,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
especial, 1
reasons, 1
for, 1
telling, 1
me, 1
to, 1
conciliate, 1
that, 1
man.", 1
"I?", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
blushing, 1
as, 1
rapidly, 1
as, 1
she, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
becoming, 1
paler, 1
than, 1
ever., 1
"Yes,, 1
doubtless;, 1

is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
that, 1
he, 1
may, 1
never, 1
do, 1
us, 1
any, 1
harm?", 1
Mercedes, 1
shuddered,, 1
and,, 1
fixing, 1
on, 1
her, 1
son, 1
a, 1
scrutinizing, 1
gaze,, 1
"You, 1
speak, 1
strangely,", 1
said, 1
she, 1
to, 1
Albert,, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
have, 1
some, 1
singular, 1
prejudices., 1
What, 1
has, 1
the, 1
count, 1
done?, 1
Three, 1
days, 1
since, 1
you, 1
were, 1
with, 1
him, 1
in, 1
Normandy;, 1
only, 1
three, 1
days, 1
since, 1
we, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
him, 1
as, 1
our, 1
best, 1
friend.", 1
An, 1
ironical, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
Albert's, 1
lips., 1
Mercedes, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
double, 1
instinct, 1
of, 1
woman, 1
and, 1
mother, 1
guessed, 1
all;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
prudent, 1
and, 1
strong-minded, 1
she, 1
concealed, 1
both, 1
her, 1
sorrows, 1
and, 1
her, 1
fears., 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
silent;, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
after,, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
resumed:, 1
"You, 1
came, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
after, 1
my, 1
health;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
candidly, 1
acknowledge, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
well., 1
You, 1
should, 1
install, 1
yourself, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
cheer, 1
my, 1
solitude., 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
left, 1
alone.", 1
"Mother,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"you, 1
know, 1
how, 1
gladly, 1
I, 1
would, 1
obey, 1
your, 1
wish,, 1
but, 1
an, 1
urgent, 1
and, 1
important, 1
affair, 1
obliges, 1
me, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
for, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
evening.", 1
"Well,", 1
replied, 1
Mercedes,, 1
sighing,, 1
"go,, 1
Albert;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
make, 1
you, 1
a, 1
slave, 1
to, 1
your, 1
filial, 1
piety.", 1
Albert, 1
pretended, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
hear,, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
and, 1
quitted, 1
her., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
he, 1
shut, 1
her, 1
door,, 1
when, 1
Mercedes, 1
called, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
servant,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
Albert, 1
wherever, 1
he, 1
should, 1
go, 1
that, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
come, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
her, 1
immediately, 1
what, 1
he, 1
observed., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
rang, 1
for, 1
her, 1
lady's, 1
maid,, 1
and,, 1
weak, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was,, 1
she, 1
dressed,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready, 1
for, 1
whatever, 1
might, 1
happen., 1
The, 1
footman's, 1
mission, 1
was, 1
an, 1
easy, 1
one., 1
Albert, 1
went, 1
to, 1
his, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
unusual, 1
care., 1
At, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
to, 1
eight, 1
Beauchamp, 1
arrived;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
the, 1
orchestra, 1
before, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
was, 1
raised., 1
Both, 1
got, 1
into, 1
Albert's, 1
coupe;, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
no, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going,, 1
he, 1
called, 1
aloud,, 1
"To, 1
the, 1
opera.", 1
In, 1
his, 1
impatience, 1
he, 1
arrived, 1
before, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
performance., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
was, 1
at, 1
his, 1
post;, 1
apprised, 1
by, 1
Beauchamp, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circumstances,, 1
he, 1
required, 1
no, 1
explanation, 1
from, 1
Albert., 1
The, 1
conduct, 1
of, 1
the, 1
son, 1
in, 1
seeking, 1
to, 1
avenge, 1
his, 1
father, 1
was, 1
so, 1
natural, 1
that, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
to, 1
dissuade, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
content, 1
with, 1
renewing, 1
his, 1
assurances, 1
of, 1
devotion., 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
come,, 1
but, 1
Albert, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
seldom, 1
lost, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera., 1
Albert, 1
wandered, 1
about, 1
the, 1
theatre, 1
until, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
up., 1
He, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
either, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lobby, 1
or, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
The, 1
bell, 1
summoned, 1
him, 1
to, 1
his, 1
seat,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
orchestra, 1
with, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp., 1
But, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
scarcely, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
box, 1
between, 1
the, 1
columns,, 1
which, 1
remained, 1
obstinately, 1
closed, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
act., 1
At, 1
last,, 1
as, 1
Albert, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
his, 1
watch, 1
for, 1
about, 1
the, 1
hundredth, 1
time,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
entered,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
and,, 1
leaning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
the, 1
pit., 1
Morrel, 1
followed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
also, 1
for, 1
his, 1
sister, 1
and, 1
brother, 1
in-law;, 1
he, 1
soon, 1
discovered, 1
them, 1
in, 1
another, 1
box,, 1
and, 1
kissed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
them., 1
The, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
survey, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pit,, 1
encountered, 1
a, 1
pale, 1
face, 1
and, 1
threatening, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
evidently, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
his, 1
attention., 1
He, 1
recognized, 1
Albert,, 1
but, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
better, 1
not, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
so, 1
angry, 1
and, 1
discomposed., 1
Without, 1
communicating, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
to, 1
his, 1
companion,, 1
he, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
his, 1
opera-glass,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
another, 1
way., 1
Although, 1
apparently, 1
not, 1
noticing, 1
Albert,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not,, 1
however,, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
fell, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
second, 1
act,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
orchestra, 1
with, 1
his, 1
two, 1
friends., 1
Then, 1
his, 1
head, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
passing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boxes,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
storm, 1
was, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
on, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
conversing, 1
cheerfully, 1
with, 1
Morrel,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
well, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
what, 1
might, 1
happen., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
turning, 1
round,, 1
saw, 1
Albert,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Well,", 1
cried, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
benevolent, 1
politeness, 1
which, 1
distinguished, 1
his, 1
salutation, 1
from, 1
the, 1
common, 1
civilities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
"my, 1
cavalier, 1
has, 1
attained, 1
his, 1
object., 1
Good-evening,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
The, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
possessed, 1
such, 1
extraordinary, 1
control, 1
over, 1
his, 1
feelings,, 1
expressed, 1
the, 1
most, 1
perfect, 1
cordiality., 1
Morrel, 1
only, 1
then, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
he, 1
had, 1
received, 1
from, 1
the, 1
viscount,, 1
in, 1
which,, 1
without, 1
assigning, 1
any, 1
reason,, 1
he, 1
begged, 1
him, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opera,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
something, 1
terrible, 1
was, 1
brooding., 1
"We, 1
are, 1
not, 1
come, 1
here,, 1
sir,, 1
to, 1
exchange, 1
hypocritical, 1
expressions, 1
of, 1
politeness,, 1
or, 1
false, 1
professions, 1
of, 1
friendship,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"but, 1
to, 1
demand, 1
an, 1
explanation.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
trembling, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
audible., 1
"An, 1
explanation, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
calm, 1
tone, 1
and, 1
penetrating, 1
eye, 1
which, 1
characterize, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
knows, 1
his, 1
cause, 1
is, 1
good., 1
"Little, 1
acquainted, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
with, 1
the, 1
habits, 1
of, 1
Parisians,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
the, 1
place, 1
for, 1
such, 1
a, 1
demand.", 1
"Still,, 1
if, 1
people, 1
will, 1
shut, 1
themselves, 1
up,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"and, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
because, 1
they, 1
are, 1
bathing,, 1
dining,, 1
or, 1
asleep,, 1
we, 1
must, 1
avail, 1
ourselves, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
whenever, 1
they, 1
are, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
difficult, 1
of, 1
access,, 1
sir;, 1
for, 1
yesterday,, 1
if, 1
my, 1
memory, 1
does, 1
not, 1
deceive, 1
me,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house.", 1
"Yesterday, 1
I, 1
was, 1
at, 1
your, 1
house,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"because, 1
then, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
not, 1
who, 1
you, 1
were.", 1
In, 1
pronouncing, 1
these, 1
words, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
so, 1
as, 1
to, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
by, 1
those, 1
in, 1
the, 1
adjoining, 1
boxes, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
lobby., 1
Thus, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
many, 1
was, 1
attracted, 1
by, 1
this, 1
altercation., 1
"Where, 1
are, 1
you, 1
come, 1
from,, 1
sir?, 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
the, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
your, 1
senses.", 1
"Provided, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
your, 1
perfidy,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
succeed, 1
in, 1
making, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
revenged,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
reasonable, 1
enough,", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
furiously., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"and, 1
if, 1
I, 1
did,, 1
your, 1
tone, 1
is, 1
too, 1
high., 1
I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
home, 1
here,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
alone, 1
have, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
my, 1
voice, 1
above, 1
another's., 1
Leave, 1
the, 1
box,, 1
sir!", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
pointed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
commanding, 1
dignity., 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
know, 1
how, 1
to, 1
make, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
your, 1
home!", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
clasping, 1
in, 1
his, 1
convulsed, 1
grasp, 1
the, 1
glove,, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
sight, 1
of., 1
"Well,, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
quietly,, 1
"I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
quarrel, 1
with, 1
me;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
would, 1
give, 1
you, 1
one, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
advice,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
do, 1
well, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
in, 1
mind., 1
It, 1
is, 1
in, 1
poor, 1
taste, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
display, 1
of, 1
a, 1
challenge., 1
Display, 1
is, 1
not, 1
becoming, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
name, 1
a, 1
murmur, 1
of, 1
astonishment, 1
passed, 1
around, 1
the, 1
group, 1
of, 1
spectators, 1
of, 1
this, 1
scene., 1
They, 1
had, 1
talked, 1
of, 1
no, 1
one, 1
but, 1
Morcerf, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
day., 1
Albert, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
allusion, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
his, 1
glove, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
when, 1
Morrel, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
while, 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
fearing, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
would, 1
surpass, 1
the, 1
limits, 1
of, 1
a, 1
challenge,, 1
held, 1
him, 1
back., 1
But, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
without, 1
rising,, 1
and, 1
leaning, 1
forward, 1
in, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
merely, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
and,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
damp,, 1
crushed, 1
glove, 1
from, 1
the, 1
clinched, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
in, 1
a, 1
solemn, 1
tone,, 1
"I, 1
consider, 1
your, 1
glove, 1
thrown,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
return, 1
it, 1
to, 1
you, 1
wrapped, 1
around, 1
a, 1
bullet., 1
Now, 1
leave, 1
me, 1

I, 1
will, 1
summon, 1
my, 1
servants, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
you, 1
out, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door.", 1
Wild,, 1
almost, 1
unconscious,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
eyes, 1
inflamed,, 1
Albert, 1
stepped, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
up, 1
his, 1
glass, 1
again, 1
as, 1
if, 1
nothing, 1
had, 1
happened;, 1
his, 1
face, 1
was, 1
like, 1
marble,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
like, 1
bronze., 1
Morrel, 1
whispered,, 1
"What, 1
have, 1
you, 1
done, 1
to, 1
him?", 1
"I?, 1
Nothing--at, 1
least, 1
personally,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"But, 1
there, 1
must, 1
be, 1
some, 1
cause, 1
for, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
scene.", 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf's, 1
adventure, 1
exasperates, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
it?", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
through, 1

"Indeed?", 1

Morrel., 1
"I, 1
had, 1
been, 1
told,, 1

would, 1
not, 1
credit, 1
it,, 1
that, 1

of, 1
Ali, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
nevertheless.", 1
"Then,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
understand, 1
it, 1
all,, 1

this, 1
scene, 1
was, 1
premeditated.", 1

so?", 1
"Yes., 1

with, 1
his, 1
imperturbable, 1
tranquillity., 1

what, 1
shall, 1
you, 1
do, 1
with, 1
him?", 1
"With, 1
whom?", 1
"With, 1
Albert.", 1
"What, 1
shall, 1

do, 1
with, 1
Albert?, 1

Morrel,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
took, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
both, 1
of, 1
his,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
shuddered, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
how, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
steady, 1
it, 1
was., 1
"Ah,, 1
Count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"his, 1
father, 1
loves, 1
him, 1
so, 1
much!", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
of, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
first, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
anger, 1
he, 1
had, 1
betrayed;, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
make, 1
him, 1
suffer.", 1
Morrel,, 1
amazed,, 1
let, 1
fall, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
hand., 1
"Count,, 1
count!", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Dear, 1
Maximilian,", 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"listen, 1
how, 1
adorably, 1
Duprez, 1

bravo!", 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1

refrained., 1

again, 1
fell,, 1

a, 1
rap, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Come, 1
in,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
that, 1
betrayed, 1
not, 1
the, 1
least, 1
emotion;, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
Beauchamp, 1
appeared., 1
"Good-evening,, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
this, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
journalist, 1
that, 1
evening;, 1
"be, 1
seated.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
bowed,, 1
and,, 1
sitting, 1
down,, 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
just, 1
now, 1
accompanied, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
saw.", 1
"And, 1
that, 1
means,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
laughing,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
had,, 1
probably,, 1
just, 1
dined, 1
together., 1
I, 1
am, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
see,, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are, 1
more, 1
sober, 1
than, 1

"Sir,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"Albert, 1
was, 1
wrong,, 1

acknowledge,, 1
to, 1

about, 1

Cristo, 1
motioned, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
silent., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
laughing,, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
all, 1
my, 1
hopes, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
destroyed.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
asked, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Doubtless, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1

me, 1
down, 1
to, 1
your, 1

level,, 1
and, 1
demand, 1
explanations!, 1
Indeed,, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
laughable.", 1
"Yet,", 1
replied, 1
Beauchamp, 1
haughtily,, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
occasions, 1
when, 1
probity, 1
commands"--, 1

strange, 1
man,, 1

is, 1
quite, 1
immaterial, 1

Beauchamp,, 1
looking, 1
with, 1
amazement, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count., 1

"Ali,, 1

dreamed, 1

upon, 1

from, 1

these, 1

disappeared, 1
almost, 1
instantaneously,, 1

sent, 1
some, 1
angel, 1
to, 1

more, 1

The, 1
Meeting., 1
After, 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
left, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
profound, 1
gloom., 1
Around, 1
him, 1
and, 1
within, 1
him, 1
the, 1
flight, 1
of, 1

seemed, 1
to, 1
have, 1
stopped;, 1
his, 1
energetic, 1

he, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1

the, 1
lamp, 1

burnt, 1
out,, 1

edifice, 1

Mercedes, 1
to, 1

the, 1
count, 1
at, 1

folly,, 1
folly!--to, 1

at., 1
He, 1
will, 1
never, 1

that, 1
my, 1
death, 1
was, 1
suicide;, 1

Seizing, 1
a, 1
pen,, 1

drew, 1
a, 1
paper, 1
from, 1
a, 1
secret, 1
drawer, 1

While, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
agitated, 1
by, 1
gloomy, 1
uncertainties,--wretched, 1
waking, 1
dreams, 1
of, 1
grief,--the, 1
first, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
morning, 1
pierced, 1
his, 1
windows,, 1
and, 1
shone, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
blue, 1
paper, 1
on, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
inscribed, 1

was, 1
just, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
when, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
noise, 1
like, 1
a, 1
stifled, 1
sigh, 1
reached, 1
his, 1
ear., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
no, 1
one;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
repeated, 1
distinctly, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
him, 1
of, 1
its, 1
reality., 1
He, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
quietly, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
saw, 1
Haidee,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
hanging, 1
down, 1
and, 1
her, 1
beautiful, 1
head, 1
thrown, 1
back., 1
She, 1
had, 1
been, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
his, 1
going, 1
out, 1
without, 1
seeing, 1
her,, 1
until, 1
sleep,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
young, 1
cannot, 1
resist,, 1
had, 1
overpowered, 1
her, 1
frame,, 1
wearied, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
with, 1
watching., 1
The, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door, 1
did, 1
not, 1
awaken, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gazed, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
affectionate, 1
regret., 1
"She, 1
remembered, 1

in, 1
four, 1
pieces,, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Then,, 1
the, 1
effort, 1
having, 1
exhausted, 1
her, 1
strength,, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
not, 1
asleep, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
fainting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
The, 1
count, 1
leaned, 1
over, 1
her, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms;, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
sweet, 1
pale, 1
face,, 1
those, 1
lovely, 1
eyes, 1
closed,, 1
that, 1
beautiful, 1
form, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
to, 1
all, 1
appearance, 1
lifeless,, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
him, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time,, 1
that, 1
perhaps, 1
she, 1
loved, 1
him, 1
otherwise, 1
than, 1
as, 1
a, 1
daughter, 1
loves, 1
a, 1
father., 1
"Alas,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
intense, 1
suffering,, 1
"I, 1
might,, 1
then,, 1
have, 1
been, 1
happy, 1
yet.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
carried, 1
Haidee, 1
to, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
resigned, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
care, 1
of, 1
her, 1
attendants,, 1
and, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
shut, 1
quickly, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
he, 1
again, 1
copied, 1
the, 1
destroyed, 1
will., 1
As, 1
he, 1
was, 1
finishing,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cabriolet, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
yard, 1
was, 1
heard., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Maximilian, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel, 1
alight., 1
"Good,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
time,"--and, 1
he, 1
sealed, 1
his, 1
will, 1
with, 1
three, 1
seals., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
afterwards, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
himself., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
there;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
twenty, 1
minutes, 1
before, 1
the, 1
time, 1
appointed., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
perhaps, 1
come, 1
too, 1
soon,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
frankly, 1
acknowledge, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
closed, 1
my, 1
eyes, 1
all, 1
night,, 1

has, 1
any, 1
one, 1
in, 1
my, 1

I, 1
need, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
strong, 1
in, 1
your, 1
courageous, 1
assurance,, 1
to, 1
recover, 1
myself.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
this, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
affection;, 1
he, 1
not, 1
only, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
but, 1
flew, 1
to, 1
him, 1
with, 1
open, 1
arms., 1
"Morrel,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
happy, 1
day, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
to, 1
feel, 1
that, 1

am, 1
beloved, 1
by, 1
such, 1
a, 1
man, 1
as, 1
you., 1
Good-morning,, 1
Emmanuel;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
come, 1
with, 1
me, 1
then,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
doubt, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
captain., 1
"But, 1
if, 1
I, 1
were, 1
wrong"--, 1
"I, 1
watched, 1
you, 1
during, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
that, 1
challenge, 1
yesterday;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
your, 1
firmness, 1
all, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
said, 1
to, 1
myself, 1
that, 1
justice, 1
must, 1
be, 1
on, 1
your, 1
side,, 1
or, 1
man's, 1
countenance, 1

on.", 1
"But,, 1
Morrel,, 1
Albert, 1
is, 1
your, 1
friend?", 1
"Simply, 1
an, 1
acquaintance,, 1
sir.", 1
"You, 1
met, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
day, 1
you, 1
first, 1
saw, 1
me?", 1
"Yes,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
true;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
recollected, 1
it, 1
if, 1
you, 1
had, 1
not, 1
reminded, 1
me.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
Morrel.", 1
Then, 1
ringing, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
once,, 1
"Look.", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Ali,, 1
who, 1
came, 1
immediately,, 1
"take, 1
that, 1
to, 1
my, 1
solicitor., 1
It, 1
is, 1
my, 1
will,, 1
Morrel., 1

I, 1
am, 1
dead,, 1

it.", 1
"What?", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"you, 1
dead?", 1
"Yes;, 1
must, 1
I, 1
not, 1
be, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
everything,, 1

what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
do, 1
yesterday, 1
after, 1
you, 1
left, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
Tortoni's,, 1
where,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
expected,, 1
I, 1
found, 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
I, 1
own, 1
I, 1
was, 1
seeking, 1
them.", 1
"Why,, 1
when, 1
all, 1
was, 1
arranged?", 1
"Listen,, 1
count;, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
is, 1
serious, 1
and, 1
unavoidable.", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
doubt, 1
it!", 1
"No;, 1
the, 1
offence, 1
was, 1
public,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
one, 1
is, 1
already, 1
talking, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Well?", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
hoped, 1
to, 1
get, 1
an, 1
exchange, 1
of, 1
arms,--to, 1
substitute, 1
the, 1
sword, 1
for, 1
the, 1
pistol;, 1
the, 1
pistol, 1
is, 1
blind.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
succeeded?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
quickly,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
imperceptible, 1
gleam, 1
of, 1
hope., 1
"No;, 1
for, 1
your, 1
skill, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sword, 1
is, 1
so, 1
well, 1
known.", 1
"Ah?--who, 1
has, 1
betrayed, 1
me?", 1

skilful, 1
swordsman, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
have, 1
conquered.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
failed?", 1
"They, 1
positively, 1
refused.", 1

said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
ever, 1
seen, 1
me, 1
fire, 1
a, 1
pistol?", 1
"Never.", 1
"Well,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
time;, 1
look.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pistols, 1
he, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
when, 1
Mercedes, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
fixing, 1
an, 1
ace, 1
of, 1
clubs, 1
against, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
plate,, 1
with, 1
four, 1
shots, 1
he, 1
successively, 1
shot, 1
off, 1
the, 1
four, 1
sides, 1
of, 1
the, 1
club., 1
At, 1
each, 1
shot, 1
Morrel, 1
turned, 1
pale., 1
He, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
bullets, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
performed, 1
this, 1
dexterous, 1
feat,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
no, 1
larger, 1
than, 1
buckshot., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
astonishing,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"Look,, 1
Emmanuel.", 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
all, 1

entreat, 1
you, 1

Albert!--the, 1

youth, 1

a, 1
mother.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
none.", 1
These, 1
words, 1
were, 1
uttered, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
made, 1
Morrel, 1
shudder., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
the, 1
offended, 1
party,, 1
count.", 1
"Doubtless;, 1
what, 1
does, 1
that, 1
imply?", 1
"That, 1
you, 1
will, 1
fire, 1
first.", 1
"I, 1
fire, 1
first?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
obtained,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
claimed, 1
that;, 1

had, 1
conceded, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
them, 1
to, 1
yield, 1
us, 1
that.", 1
"And, 1
at, 1
what, 1
distance?", 1
"Twenty, 1
paces.", 1
A, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
terrible, 1
import, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
lips., 1
"Morrel,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
forget, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
seen.", 1
"The, 1
only, 1
chance, 1
for, 1
Albert's, 1
safety,, 1

will, 1
arise, 1
from, 1
your, 1
emotion.", 1
"I, 1
suffer, 1
from, 1
emotion?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Or, 1
from, 1
your, 1
generosity,, 1
my, 1
friend;, 1
to, 1
so, 1
good, 1
a, 1
marksman, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are,, 1

is, 1
that?", 1
"Break, 1
his, 1

him--but, 1
do, 1
not, 1
kill, 1
him.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1

the, 1
count,, 1

"And, 1
you?", 1

shall, 1
be, 1
brought, 1

"No,, 1
no,", 1
cried, 1
Maximilian,, 1
quite, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
his, 1
feelings., 1
"As, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Morrel,, 1
M., 1
de, 1

looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
in, 1
utter, 1
amazement., 1

what, 1
has, 1

Brutus, 1
the, 1
night, 1
before, 1

Morrel,, 1
that, 1

had, 1
lived, 1
long, 1
enough.", 1
Maximilian, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
drew, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
go,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1

A, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
in, 1
readiness, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
it, 1
with, 1
his, 1
two, 1
friends., 1
He, 1
had, 1
stopped, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1

up, 1

Morrel,, 1
looking, 1
out, 1
of, 1

window., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1

said, 1
Baptistin,, 1

followed, 1

master, 1
with, 1
indescribable, 1
terror,, 1

lightly, 1
from, 1

offered, 1
his, 1

to, 1

retained, 1

hand, 1
between, 1

will, 1
inquire,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Do;, 1
but, 1
make, 1
no, 1
treaty--you, 1
understand, 1
me?", 1
"You, 1
need, 1
not, 1
fear.", 1
Morrel, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
who,, 1
seeing, 1
his, 1
intention,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
The, 1
three, 1
young, 1
men, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
each, 1
other, 1
courteously,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
affably., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
see, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf.", 1
"He, 1
sent, 1
us, 1
word, 1
this, 1
morning,", 1
replied, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
meet, 1
us, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
Beauchamp, 1
pulled, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
only, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
past, 1
eight,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Morrel;, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
not, 1
much, 1
time, 1
lost, 1
yet.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
made, 1
no, 1
allusion, 1
of, 1
that, 1
kind,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel., 1
"There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
coming,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
It, 1
advanced, 1
rapidly, 1
along, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
avenues, 1
leading, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
open, 1
space, 1
where, 1
they, 1
were, 1
assembled., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
doubtless, 1
provided, 1
with, 1
pistols,, 1
gentlemen?, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
yields, 1
his, 1
right, 1
of, 1
using, 1
his.", 1
"We, 1
had, 1
anticipated, 1
this, 1
kindness, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
brought, 1
some, 1
weapons, 1
which, 1
I, 1
bought, 1
eight, 1
or, 1
ten, 1
days, 1
since,, 1
thinking, 1
to, 1
want, 1
them, 1
on, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
occasion., 1

are, 1
quite, 1
new,, 1

you, 1
examine, 1
them.", 1
"Oh,, 1
M., 1
Beauchamp,, 1

you, 1
assure, 1
me, 1
that, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
does, 1
not, 1
know, 1
these, 1
pistols,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
readily, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
your, 1
word, 1
will, 1
be, 1
quite, 1
sufficient.", 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
Morcerf, 1
coming, 1
in, 1
that, 1
carriage;--faith,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Debray!", 1
The, 1
two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
he, 1
announced, 1
were, 1
indeed, 1
approaching., 1
"What, 1
chance, 1
brings, 1
you, 1
here,, 1
gentlemen?", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
shaking, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
each, 1
of, 1
them., 1
"Because,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"Albert, 1
sent, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
to, 1
request, 1
us, 1
to, 1
come.", 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
exchanged, 1
looks, 1
of, 1
astonishment., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
understand, 1
his, 1
reason,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"Yesterday, 1
afternoon, 1
I, 1
received, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
begging, 1
me, 1
to, 1
attend, 1
the, 1
opera.", 1
"And, 1
I,", 1
said, 1
Debray., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
also,", 1
said, 1
Franz., 1
"And, 1
we,, 1
too,", 1
added, 1
Beauchamp, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Having, 1
wished, 1
you, 1
all, 1
to, 1

now, 1
wishes, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
present, 1
at, 1
the, 1
combat.", 1
"Exactly, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men;, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
probably, 1
guessed, 1
right.", 1
"But,, 1
after, 1
all, 1
these, 1
arrangements,, 1
he, 1
does, 1
not, 1
come, 1
himself,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Albert, 1
is, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
time.", 1
"There, 1
he, 1
comes,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"on, 1
horseback,, 1
at, 1
full, 1
gallop,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
servant.", 1
"How, 1
imprudent,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"to, 1
come, 1
on, 1
horseback, 1
to, 1
fight, 1
a, 1
duel, 1
with, 1
pistols,, 1
after, 1
all, 1
the, 1
instructions, 1
I, 1
had, 1
given, 1
him.", 1
"And, 1
besides,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"with, 1
a, 1
collar, 1
above, 1
his, 1
cravat,, 1
an, 1
open, 1
coat, 1
and, 1
white, 1
waistcoat!, 1
Why, 1
has, 1
he, 1
not, 1
painted, 1
a, 1
spot, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
heart?--it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
more, 1
simple.", 1
Meanwhile, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
within, 1
ten, 1
paces, 1
of, 1
the, 1
group, 1
formed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
five, 1
young, 1
men., 1
He, 1
jumped, 1
from, 1
his, 1
horse,, 1
threw, 1
the, 1
bridle, 1
on, 1
his, 1
servant's, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
joined, 1
them., 1
He, 1
was, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
red, 1
and, 1
swollen;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
slept., 1
A, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
melancholy, 1
gravity, 1
overspread, 1
his, 1
countenance,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
not, 1
natural, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"for, 1
having, 1
complied, 1
with, 1
my, 1
request;, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
extremely, 1
grateful, 1
for, 1
this, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
friendship.", 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
as, 1
Morcerf, 1
approached,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
at, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance., 1
"And, 1
to, 1
you, 1
also,, 1
M., 1
Morrel,, 1
my, 1
thanks, 1
are, 1
due., 1
Come,, 1
there, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
too, 1
many.", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
perhaps, 1
aware, 1

Morrel, 1
was, 1
preparing, 1
to, 1
fulfil, 1
his, 1
commission., 1
Beauchamp, 1
had, 1
meanwhile, 1
drawn, 1
the, 1
box, 1
of, 1
pistols, 1
from, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Stop,, 1

Morrel., 1
"No,, 1

Albert's, 1
witnesses, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other., 1
Franz, 1
and, 1
Debray, 1
exchanged, 1
some, 1
words, 1
in, 1
a, 1
whisper,, 1
and, 1
Morrel,, 1
rejoiced, 1
at, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
incident,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
walking, 1
in, 1
a, 1
retired, 1
path, 1
with, 1
Emmanuel., 1
"What, 1
does, 1
he, 1
want, 1
with, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,, 1

he, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Ah?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
trust, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
going, 1
to, 1
tempt, 1
me, 1
by, 1
some, 1
fresh, 1
insult!", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
that, 1
such, 1
is, 1
his, 1
intention,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
count, 1
advanced,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Maximilian, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel., 1
His, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
serene, 1
look, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
contrast, 1
to, 1
Albert's, 1
grief-stricken, 1
face,, 1
who, 1
approached, 1
also,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
other, 1
four, 1
young, 1
men., 1
When, 1
at, 1
three, 1
paces, 1
distant, 1
from, 1
each, 1
other,, 1
Albert, 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
stopped., 1
"Approach,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
Albert;, 1
"I, 1
wish, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
one, 1
word, 1
of, 1

am, 1
about, 1

it, 1
may, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Proceed,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
at, 1
first, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tremulous, 1
voice,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
gradually, 1
became, 1
firmer,, 1
"I, 1
reproached, 1
you, 1
with, 1
exposing, 1
the, 1
conduct, 1
of, 1

in, 1
Epirus,, 1
for, 1
guilty, 1
as, 1
I, 1
knew, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
had, 1
no, 1
right, 1
to, 1
punish, 1
him;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
since, 1
learned, 1
that, 1
you, 1
had, 1
that, 1
right., 1
It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
Fernand, 1
Mondego's, 1
treachery, 1
towards, 1
Ali, 1
Pasha, 1
which, 1
induces, 1
me, 1
so, 1
readily, 1
to, 1
excuse, 1

the, 1
treachery, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fisherman, 1

towards, 1
you,, 1

the, 1
almost, 1
unheard-of, 1
miseries, 1

were, 1
its, 1
consequences;, 1

I, 1
say,, 1
and, 1
proclaim, 1
it, 1
publicly,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
justified, 1
in, 1
revenging, 1
yourself, 1
on, 1
my, 1
father,, 1

I,, 1
his, 1
son,, 1

you, 1
for, 1

using, 1
greater, 1
severity.", 1

a, 1
thunderbolt, 1
fallen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spectators, 1
of, 1
this, 1
unexpected, 1
scene,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
not, 1
have, 1
surprised, 1
them, 1
more, 1
than, 1
did, 1
Albert's, 1
declaration., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
slowly, 1
rose, 1
towards, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
infinite, 1
gratitude., 1
He, 1
could, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
how, 1
Albert's, 1
fiery, 1
nature,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
so, 1
much, 1
among, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
bandits,, 1
had, 1
suddenly, 1
stooped, 1
to, 1
this, 1
humiliation., 1
He, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
why, 1
her, 1
noble, 1
heart, 1
had, 1
not, 1
opposed, 1
the, 1
sacrifice, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
beforehand, 1
would, 1
be, 1
useless., 1
"Now,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
think, 1
my, 1
apology, 1

the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1

of, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
of, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
or, 1
of, 1
any, 1
of, 1
that, 1

but, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
that, 1
courageous, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
to, 1
plead, 1
for, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
life,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
offered, 1
his,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
now, 1
saved, 1
it, 1
by, 1
the, 1
revelation, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
family, 1

capable, 1
of, 1
destroying, 1
forever, 1
in, 1
that, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
heart, 1
every, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
filial, 1
piety., 1
"Providence, 1
still,", 1
murmured, 1
he;, 1
"now, 1
only, 1
am, 1
I, 1
fully, 1
convinced, 1
of, 1
being, 1

The, 1
Count, 1

to, 1
the, 1
five, 1
young, 1
men, 1
with, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
and, 1
dignified, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
got, 1
into, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
with, 1
Maximilian, 1
and, 1
Emmanuel., 1
Albert,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
remained, 1
alone., 1
Albert, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
two, 1
friends,, 1
not, 1
timidly,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
a, 1
way, 1
that, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
their, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
done., 1
"Indeed,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
first,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
either, 1
the, 1
most, 1
feeling, 1
or, 1
the, 1
least, 1
dissimulation,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
congratulate, 1
you;, 1
this, 1
is, 1
a, 1
very, 1
unhoped-for, 1
conclusion, 1
of, 1
a, 1
very, 1
disagreeable, 1
affair.", 1
Albert, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
wrapped, 1
in, 1
thought., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
tapping, 1
his, 1
boot, 1
with, 1
his, 1
flexible, 1
cane., 1
"Are, 1
we, 1
not, 1
going?", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
after, 1
this, 1
embarrassing, 1
silence., 1
"When, 1
you, 1
please,", 1
replied, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
only, 1
to, 1
compliment, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
given, 1
proof, 1
to-day, 1
of, 1
rare, 1
chivalric, 1
generosity.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
magnificent,", 1
continued, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
exercise, 1
so, 1
much, 1
self-control!", 1
"Assuredly;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
incapable, 1
of, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
with, 1
most, 1
significant, 1
coolness., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
interrupted, 1
Albert,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
something, 1
very, 1
serious, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
between, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
myself.", 1
"Possibly,, 1
possibly,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
immediately;, 1
"but, 1
every, 1
simpleton, 1
would, 1
not, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1

later, 1
you, 1
will, 1
find, 1
yourself, 1
compelled, 1
to, 1
explain, 1
it, 1
to, 1

energetically, 1

would, 1
be, 1
convenient, 1

your, 1
bodily, 1
health, 1
and, 1
the, 1
duration, 1
of, 1

you, 1
a, 1
friendly, 1
counsel?, 1

out, 1
for, 1
Naples,, 1

Hague,, 1

St., 1
Petersburg--calm, 1
countries,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
honor, 1
is, 1
better, 1
understood, 1
than, 1
among, 1
our, 1
hot-headed, 1
Parisians., 1
Seek, 1
quietude, 1
and, 1
oblivion,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
you, 1
may, 1
return, 1
peaceably, 1
to, 1
France, 1
after, 1
a, 1
few, 1
years., 1
Am, 1
I, 1
not, 1
right,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Chateau-Renaud?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
my, 1
opinion,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
gentleman;, 1
"nothing, 1
induces, 1
serious, 1
duels, 1
so, 1
much, 1
as, 1
a, 1
duel, 1
forsworn.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
replied, 1
Albert,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
indifference;, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
follow, 1
your, 1
advice--not, 1
because, 1
you, 1
give, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
I, 1
had, 1
before, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
France., 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
equally, 1
for, 1
the, 1
service, 1
you, 1
have, 1
rendered, 1
me, 1
in, 1
being, 1
my, 1
seconds., 1
It, 1
is, 1
deeply, 1
engraved, 1
on, 1
my, 1
heart,, 1
and,, 1
after, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
said,, 1
I, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
only.", 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
each, 1
other;, 1
the, 1
impression, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
on, 1
both, 1
of, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
just, 1
expressed, 1
his, 1
thanks, 1
was, 1
so, 1
determined, 1
that, 1
the, 1
position, 1
would, 1
have, 1
become, 1
embarrassing, 1
for, 1
all, 1
if, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
had, 1
continued., 1
"Good-by,, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp, 1
suddenly,, 1
carelessly, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
arouse, 1
from, 1
his, 1
lethargy;, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
offered, 1
hand., 1
"Good-by,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
in, 1
his, 1
turn,, 1
keeping, 1
his, 1
little, 1
cane, 1
in, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
saluting, 1
with, 1
his, 1
right., 1
Albert's, 1
lips, 1
scarcely, 1
whispered, 1
"Good-by,", 1
but, 1
his, 1
look, 1
was, 1
more, 1
explicit;, 1
it, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
whole, 1
poem, 1
of, 1
restrained, 1
anger,, 1
proud, 1
disdain,, 1
and, 1
generous, 1
indignation., 1
He, 1
preserved, 1
his, 1
melancholy, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
position, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
after, 1
his, 1
two, 1
friends, 1
had, 1
regained, 1
their, 1
carriage;, 1
then, 1
suddenly, 1
unfastening, 1
his, 1
horse, 1
from, 1
the, 1
little, 1
tree, 1
to, 1
which, 1
his, 1
servant, 1
had, 1
tied, 1
it,, 1
he, 1
mounted, 1
and, 1
galloped, 1
off, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Paris., 1
In, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
he, 1
was, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
du, 1
Helder., 1
As, 1
he, 1
alighted,, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
pale, 1
face, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
bedroom., 1
Albert, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own, 1
apartments., 1
He, 1
cast, 1
one, 1
lingering, 1
look, 1
on, 1
all, 1
the, 1
luxuries, 1
which, 1
had, 1
rendered, 1
life, 1
so, 1
easy, 1
and, 1
so, 1
happy, 1
since, 1
his, 1
infancy;, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
pictures,, 1
whose, 1
faces, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
landscapes,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
painted, 1
in, 1
brighter, 1
colors., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
took, 1
away, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
portrait,, 1
with, 1
its, 1
oaken, 1
frame,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
gilt, 1
frame, 1
from, 1
which, 1
he, 1
took, 1
it, 1
black, 1
and, 1
empty., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
arranged, 1
all, 1
his, 1
beautiful, 1
Turkish, 1
arms,, 1
his, 1
fine, 1
English, 1
guns,, 1
his, 1
Japanese, 1
china,, 1
his, 1
cups, 1
mounted, 1
in, 1
silver,, 1
his, 1
artistic, 1
bronzes, 1
by, 1
Feucheres, 1
and, 1
Barye;, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
cupboards,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
key, 1
in, 1
each;, 1
threw, 1
into, 1
a, 1
drawer, 1
of, 1
his, 1
secretary,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
left, 1
open,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
pocket-money, 1
he, 1
had, 1
about, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
it, 1
the, 1
thousand, 1
fancy, 1
jewels, 1
from, 1
his, 1
vases, 1
and, 1
his, 1
jewel-boxes;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
made, 1
an, 1
exact, 1
inventory, 1
of, 1
everything,, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
conspicuous, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
after, 1
putting, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
books, 1
and, 1
papers, 1
which, 1
had, 1
collected, 1
there., 1
At, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
this, 1
work,, 1
his, 1
servant,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
orders, 1
to, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
his, 1
room., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
more, 1
sorrowful, 1
than, 1
angry, 1
tone., 1
"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
valet;, 1
"you, 1
had, 1
forbidden, 1
me, 1
to, 1
disturb, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
has, 1
called, 1
me.", 1
"Well!", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
him, 1
without, 1
first, 1
seeing, 1
you.", 1
"Why?", 1
"Because, 1
the, 1
count, 1
is, 1
doubtless, 1
aware, 1
that, 1
I, 1
accompanied, 1
you, 1
to, 1
the, 1
meeting, 1
this, 1
morning.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
probable,", 1
said, 1
Albert., 1
"And, 1
since, 1
he, 1
has, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
doubtless, 1
to, 1
question, 1
me, 1
on, 1
what, 1
happened, 1
there., 1
What, 1
must, 1
I, 1
answer?", 1
"The, 1
truth.", 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
say, 1
the, 1
duel, 1
did, 1
not, 1
take, 1
place?", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
say, 1
I, 1
apologized, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Go.", 1
The, 1
valet, 1
bowed, 1
and, 1
retired,, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
his, 1
inventory., 1
As, 1
he, 1
was, 1
finishing, 1
this, 1
work,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
horses, 1
prancing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
yard,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
wheels, 1
of, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
window,, 1
attracted, 1
his, 1
attention., 1
He, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
his, 1
father, 1
get, 1
into, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
drive, 1
away., 1
The, 1
door, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
closed, 1
when, 1
Albert, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
room;, 1
and,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
being, 1
there, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bed-chamber,, 1
and, 1
distressed, 1
by, 1
what, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
and, 1
guessed,, 1
stopped, 1
for, 1
one, 1
moment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
As, 1
if, 1
the, 1
same, 1
idea, 1
had, 1
animated, 1
these, 1
two, 1
beings,, 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
doing, 1
the, 1
same, 1
in, 1
her, 1
apartments, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
done, 1
in, 1
his., 1
Everything, 1
was, 1
in, 1
order,--laces,, 1
dresses,, 1
jewels,, 1
linen,, 1
money,, 1
all, 1
were, 1
arranged, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawers,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
countess, 1
was, 1
carefully, 1
collecting, 1
the, 1
keys., 1
Albert, 1
saw, 1
all, 1
these, 1
preparations, 1
and, 1
understood, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
exclaiming,, 1
"My, 1
mother!", 1
he, 1
threw, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
around, 1
her, 1
neck., 1
The, 1
artist, 1
who, 1
could, 1
have, 1
depicted, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
countenances, 1
would, 1
certainly, 1
have, 1
made, 1
of, 1
them, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
picture., 1
All, 1
these, 1
proofs, 1
of, 1
an, 1
energetic, 1
resolution,, 1
which, 1
Albert, 1
did, 1
not, 1
fear, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own, 1
account,, 1
alarmed, 1
him, 1
for, 1
his, 1
mother., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
doing?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"What, 1
were, 1
you, 1
doing?", 1
replied, 1
she., 1
"Oh,, 1
my, 1
mother!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert,, 1
so, 1
overcome, 1
he, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
speak;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
same, 1
with, 1
you, 1
and, 1
me--you, 1
cannot, 1
have, 1
made, 1
the, 1
same, 1
resolution, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
come, 1
to, 1
warn, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
bid, 1
adieu, 1
to, 1
your, 1
house,, 1
and--and, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
also,", 1
replied, 1
Mercedes,, 1
"am, 1
going,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
acknowledge, 1
I, 1
had, 1
depended, 1
on, 1
your, 1
accompanying, 1
me;, 1
have, 1
I, 1
deceived, 1
myself?", 1
"Mother,", 1
said, 1
Albert, 1
with, 1
firmness., 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
make, 1
you, 1
share, 1
the, 1
fate, 1
I, 1
have, 1
planned, 1
for, 1
myself., 1
I, 1
must, 1
live, 1
henceforth, 1
without, 1
rank, 1
and, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
this, 1
hard, 1
apprenticeship, 1
I, 1
must, 1
borrow, 1
from, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
the, 1
loaf, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
eat, 1
until, 1
I, 1
have, 1
earned, 1
one., 1
So,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
mother,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
Franz, 1
to, 1
lend, 1
me, 1
the, 1
small, 1
sum, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
require, 1
to, 1
supply, 1
my, 1
present, 1
wants.", 1
"You,, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
child,, 1
suffer, 1
poverty, 1
and, 1
hunger?, 1
Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
say, 1
so;, 1
it, 1

furnished, 1
house, 1

was, 1
alighting,, 1
a, 1
man, 1

Bertuccio., 1

it,, 1

looked, 1
round, 1

was, 1
gone., 1

eyes, 1
and, 1
heaving, 1
breast,, 1

without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
her, 1
the, 1
letter., 1
Mercedes, 1
read:--, 1
Albert,--While, 1
showing, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
your, 1
plans,, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
also, 1
to, 1
convince, 1
you, 1
of, 1
my, 1
delicacy., 1
You, 1
are, 1
free,, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
take, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
to, 1
your, 1
home;, 1
but, 1
reflect,, 1
Albert,, 1
you, 1
owe, 1
her, 1
more, 1
than, 1
your, 1
poor, 1
noble, 1
heart, 1
can, 1
pay, 1
her., 1
Keep, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
for, 1
yourself,, 1
bear, 1
all, 1
the, 1
suffering,, 1
but, 1
spare, 1
her, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
of, 1
poverty, 1
which, 1
must, 1
accompany, 1
your, 1
first, 1
efforts;, 1
for, 1
she, 1
deserves, 1
not, 1
even, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
which, 1
has, 1
this, 1
day, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
providence, 1
is, 1
not, 1
willing, 1
that, 1
the, 1
innocent, 1
should, 1
suffer, 1
for, 1
the, 1
guilty., 1

Rue, 1
du, 1
Helder, 1
without, 1
taking, 1
anything, 1
with, 1
you., 1
Do, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
to, 1
know, 1
how, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
it;, 1
I, 1
know, 1
it--that, 1
is, 1
sufficient., 1
Now,, 1
listen,, 1
Albert., 1
Twenty-four, 1
years, 1
ago, 1
I, 1
returned,, 1
proud, 1
and, 1
joyful,, 1
to, 1
my, 1
country., 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
betrothed,, 1
Albert,, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
girl, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
adored,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
bringing, 1
to, 1
my, 1
betrothed, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
fifty, 1
louis,, 1
painfully, 1
amassed, 1
by, 1
ceaseless, 1
toil., 1
This, 1
money, 1
was, 1
for, 1
her;, 1
I, 1
destined, 1
it, 1
for, 1
her,, 1
and,, 1
knowing, 1
the, 1
treachery, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
I, 1
buried, 1
our, 1
treasure, 1
in, 1
the, 1
little, 1
garden, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
my, 1
father, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan., 1
Your, 1
mother,, 1
Albert,, 1
knows, 1
that, 1
poor, 1
house, 1
well., 1
A, 1
short, 1
time, 1
since, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
Marseilles,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
old, 1
place,, 1
which, 1
revived, 1
so, 1
many, 1
painful, 1
recollections;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
I, 1
took, 1
a, 1
spade, 1
and, 1
dug, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
where, 1
I, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
my, 1
treasure., 1
The, 1
iron, 1
box, 1
was, 1
there--no, 1
one, 1
had, 1
touched, 1
it--under, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
fig-tree, 1
my, 1
father, 1
had, 1
planted, 1
the, 1
day, 1
I, 1
was, 1
born,, 1
which, 1
overshadowed, 1
the, 1
spot., 1
Well,, 1
Albert,, 1
this, 1
money,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
formerly, 1
designed, 1
to, 1
promote, 1
the, 1
comfort, 1
and, 1
tranquillity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
I, 1
adored,, 1
may, 1
now,, 1
through, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
painful, 1
circumstances,, 1
be, 1
devoted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
same, 1
purpose., 1
Oh,, 1
feel, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
offer, 1
millions, 1
to, 1
that, 1
poor, 1
woman,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
return, 1
her, 1
only, 1
the, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
black, 1
bread, 1
forgotten, 1
under, 1
my, 1
poor, 1
roof, 1
since, 1
the, 1
day, 1
I, 1
was, 1
torn, 1
from, 1
her, 1
I, 1
loved., 1
You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
generous, 1
man,, 1
Albert,, 1
but, 1
perhaps, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be, 1
blinded, 1
by, 1
pride, 1
or, 1
resentment;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
me,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
another, 1
for, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
say, 1
it, 1
is, 1
ungenerous, 1
of, 1
you, 1
to, 1
refuse, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
your, 1
mother, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
father, 1
was, 1
allowed, 1
by, 1
your, 1
father, 1
to, 1
die, 1
in, 1
all, 1
the, 1
horrors, 1
of, 1
poverty, 1
and, 1
despair., 1
Albert, 1
stood, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
what, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
would, 1
decide, 1
after, 1
she, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
reading, 1
this, 1
letter., 1
Mercedes, 1
turned, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
an, 1
ineffable, 1
look, 1
towards, 1
heaven., 1
"I, 1
accept, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"he, 1
has, 1
a, 1
right, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
dowry,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
take, 1
with, 1
me, 1
to, 1
some, 1
convent!", 1
Putting, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
in, 1
her, 1
bosom,, 1
she, 1
took, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firmer, 1
step, 1
than, 1
she, 1
even, 1
herself, 1
expected, 1
she, 1
went, 1
down-stairs., 1
Chapter, 1
92., 1
The, 1
Suicide., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
also, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
town, 1
with, 1
Emmanuel, 1
and, 1
Maximilian., 1
Their, 1
return, 1
was, 1
cheerful., 1
Emmanuel, 1
did, 1
not, 1
conceal, 1
his, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
the, 1
peaceful, 1
termination, 1
of, 1
the, 1
affair,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
loud, 1
in, 1
his, 1
expressions, 1
of, 1
delight., 1
Morrel,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
allowed, 1
his, 1
brother-in-law's, 1
gayety, 1
to, 1
expend, 1
itself, 1
in, 1
words,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
equal, 1
inward, 1
joy,, 1
which,, 1
however,, 1
betrayed, 1
itself, 1
only, 1
in, 1
his, 1
countenance., 1
At, 1
the, 1
Barriere, 1
du, 1
Trone, 1
they, 1
met, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
there,, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sentinel, 1
at, 1
his, 1
post., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
put, 1
his, 1
head, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
with, 1
him, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
steward, 1
disappeared., 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Place, 1
Royale,, 1
"put, 1
me, 1
down, 1
at, 1
my, 1
door,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
wife, 1
may, 1
not, 1
have, 1
a, 1
single, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
needless, 1
anxiety, 1
on, 1
my, 1
account, 1
or, 1
yours.", 1
"If, 1
it, 1
were, 1
not, 1
ridiculous, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
display, 1
of, 1
our, 1
triumph,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
invite, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
our, 1
house;, 1
besides, 1
that,, 1
he, 1
doubtless, 1
has, 1
some, 1
trembling, 1
heart, 1
to, 1
comfort., 1
So, 1
we, 1
will, 1
take, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
our, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
him, 1
hasten, 1
home.", 1
"Stop, 1
a, 1
moment,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"do, 1
not, 1

both, 1
my, 1
companions., 1
Return,, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
to, 1
your, 1
charming, 1
wife,, 1

present, 1
my, 1
best, 1
compliments, 1
to, 1
her;, 1

do, 1
you,, 1
Morrel,, 1
accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees.", 1
"Willingly,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian;, 1
"particularly, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
business, 1
in, 1
that, 1
quarter.", 1
"Shall, 1
we, 1
wait, 1
breakfast, 1
for, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
Emmanuel., 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
The, 1
door, 1
was, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
proceeded., 1
"See, 1
what, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
I, 1
brought, 1
you!", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
thought, 1
so?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"for, 1
that, 1
reason, 1

wished, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
you, 1
near, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
miraculous!", 1
continued, 1
Morrel,, 1
answering, 1
his, 1
own, 1
thoughts., 1
"What?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"What, 1
has, 1
just, 1
happened.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
right--it, 1
is, 1
miraculous.", 1
"For, 1
Albert, 1
is, 1
brave,", 1
resumed, 1
Morrel., 1
"Very, 1
brave,", 1

suspended, 1
over, 1

head.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
know, 1
he, 1
has, 1
fought, 1
two, 1
duels,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"How, 1
can, 1

reconcile, 1
that, 1
with, 1

to, 1
your, 1
influence,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well, 1
for, 1
Albert, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
army,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Why?", 1
"An, 1
apology, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
captain,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
mildly,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
entertain, 1
the, 1
prejudices, 1
of, 1
ordinary, 1
men,, 1
Morrel!, 1
Acknowledge,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
Albert, 1
is, 1
brave,, 1
he, 1
cannot, 1
be, 1
a, 1
coward;, 1
he, 1
must, 1
then, 1
have, 1
had, 1
some, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
acting, 1
as, 1
he, 1
did, 1
this, 1
morning,, 1
and, 1
confess, 1
that, 1
his, 1
conduct, 1
is, 1
more, 1
heroic, 1
than, 1
otherwise.", 1
"Doubtless,, 1
doubtless,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
say,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Spaniard,, 1
'He, 1
has, 1
not, 1
been, 1
so, 1
brave, 1
to-day, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
yesterday.'", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
breakfast, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
Morrel?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
the, 1
conversation., 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
must, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock.", 1
"Your, 1
engagement, 1
was, 1
for, 1
breakfast,, 1
then?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Morrel, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"Still, 1
you, 1
must, 1
breakfast, 1
somewhere.", 1
"But, 1
if, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
hungry?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
only, 1
know, 1
two, 1
things, 1
which, 1
destroy, 1
the, 1
appetite,--grief--and, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
very, 1
cheerful,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
that--and, 1
love., 1
Now, 1
after, 1
what, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
of, 1
your, 1
heart,, 1
I, 1
may, 1
believe"--, 1
"Well,, 1
count,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel, 1
gayly,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
dispute, 1
it.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
make, 1
me, 1
your, 1
confidant,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
showed, 1
how, 1
gladly, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
admitted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
secret., 1
"I, 1
showed, 1
you, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
heart,, 1
did, 1
I, 1
not,, 1
count?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
only, 1
answered, 1
by, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Well,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
"since, 1
that, 1
heart, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
with, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Bois, 1
de, 1
Vincennes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
elsewhere,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
must, 1
go, 1
and, 1
find, 1
it.", 1
"Go,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count, 1
deliberately;, 1
"go,, 1
dear, 1
friend,, 1
but, 1
promise, 1
me, 1
if, 1
you, 1
meet, 1
with, 1
any, 1
obstacle, 1
to, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
some, 1
power, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
use, 1
that, 1
power, 1
in, 1
the, 1
behalf, 1
of, 1
those, 1
I, 1

and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
love, 1
you,, 1
Morrel.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
remember, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"as, 1
selfish, 1
children, 1
recollect, 1
their, 1
parents, 1
when, 1
they, 1
want, 1
their, 1
aid., 1
When, 1
I, 1
need, 1
your, 1
assistance,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
arrives,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
come, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
count.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
rely, 1
upon, 1
your, 1
promise., 1
Good-by,, 1
then.", 1
"Good-by,, 1
till, 1
we, 1
meet, 1
again.", 1
They, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
carriage-door,, 1
Morrel, 1
sprang, 1
out, 1
on, 1
the, 1
pavement,, 1
Bertuccio, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
steps., 1
Morrel, 1
disappeared, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Avenue, 1
de, 1
Marigny,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
join, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
"She, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
her, 1
house,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
steward., 1
"And, 1
her, 1
son?", 1
"Florentin,, 1
his, 1
valet,, 1
thinks, 1
he, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do, 1
the, 1
same.", 1
"Come, 1
this, 1
way.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
Bertuccio, 1
into, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
we, 1
have, 1
seen,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
steward., 1
"Go,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
quickly., 1
"But, 1
first,, 1
let, 1
Haidee, 1
be, 1
informed, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
returned.", 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
had, 1
run, 1
down-stairs, 1
and, 1
whose, 1
face, 1
was, 1
radiant, 1
with, 1
joy, 1
at, 1
seeing, 1
the, 1
count, 1
return, 1
safely., 1
Bertuccio, 1
left., 1
Every, 1
transport, 1
of, 1
a, 1
daughter, 1
finding, 1
a, 1
father,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mistress, 1
seeing, 1
an, 1
adored, 1
lover,, 1
were, 1
felt, 1
by, 1
Haidee, 1
during, 1
the, 1
first, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
this, 1
meeting,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
so, 1
eagerly, 1
expected., 1
Doubtless,, 1
although, 1
less, 1
evident,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
joy, 1
was, 1
not, 1
less, 1
intense., 1
Joy, 1
to, 1
hearts, 1
which, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
long, 1
is, 1
like, 1
the, 1
dew, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
after, 1
a, 1
long, 1
drought;, 1
both, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
absorb, 1
that, 1
beneficent, 1
moisture, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
is, 1
outwardly, 1
apparent., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
think,, 1
what, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
believe,, 1
that, 1
there, 1
were, 1
two, 1
Mercedes, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
might, 1
yet, 1
be, 1
happy., 1
His, 1
eye,, 1
elate, 1
with, 1
happiness,, 1
was, 1
reading, 1
eagerly, 1
the, 1
tearful, 1
gaze, 1
of, 1
Haidee,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened., 1
The, 1
count, 1
knit, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
"M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf!", 1
said, 1
Baptistin,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
that, 1
name, 1
sufficed, 1
for, 1
his, 1
excuse., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
face, 1
brightened., 1
"Which,", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
"the, 1
viscount, 1
or, 1
the, 1
count?", 1
"The, 1
count.", 1
"Oh,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Haidee,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
over?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
not, 1
if, 1
it, 1
is, 1
finished,, 1
my, 1
beloved, 1
child,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
hands;, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
do, 1
know, 1
you, 1
have, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
fear.", 1
"But, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
wretched"--, 1
"That, 1
man, 1
cannot, 1
injure, 1
me,, 1
Haidee,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"it, 1
was, 1
his, 1
son, 1
alone, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
fear.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
suffered,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
"you, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
know,, 1
my, 1
lord.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
smiled., 1
"By, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
tomb,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
"I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
Haidee,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
any, 1
misfortune, 1
happens,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
lord,, 1
as, 1
implicitly, 1
as, 1
if, 1
God, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
presenting, 1
her, 1
forehead, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
pressed, 1
on, 1
that, 1
pure, 1
beautiful, 1
forehead, 1
a, 1
kiss, 1
which, 1
made, 1
two, 1
hearts, 1
throb, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
violently,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
heavily., 1
"Oh,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"shall, 1
I, 1
then, 1
be, 1
permitted, 1
to, 1
love, 1
again?, 1
Ask, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Baptistin,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
led, 1
the, 1
beautiful, 1
Greek, 1
girl, 1
to, 1
a, 1
private, 1
staircase., 1
We, 1
must, 1
explain, 1
this, 1
visit,, 1
which, 1
although, 1
expected, 1
by, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
is, 1
unexpected, 1
to, 1
our, 1
readers., 1
While, 1
Mercedes,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
was, 1
making, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
inventory, 1
of, 1
her, 1
property, 1
to, 1
Albert's,, 1
while, 1
she, 1
was, 1
arranging, 1
her, 1
jewels,, 1
shutting, 1
her, 1
drawers,, 1
collecting, 1
her, 1
keys,, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
everything, 1
in, 1
perfect, 1
order,, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
perceive, 1
a, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
sinister, 1
face, 1
at, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
door, 1
which, 1
threw, 1
light, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
everything, 1
could, 1
be, 1
both, 1
seen, 1
and, 1
heard., 1
He, 1
who, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
looking,, 1
without, 1
being, 1
heard, 1
or, 1
seen,, 1
probably, 1
heard, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
all, 1
that, 1
passed, 1
in, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's, 1
apartments., 1
From, 1
that, 1
glass, 1
door, 1
the, 1
pale-faced, 1
man, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
bedroom, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
with, 1
a, 1
constricted, 1
hand, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
of, 1
a, 1
window, 1
overlooking, 1
the, 1
court-yard., 1
He, 1
remained, 1
there, 1
ten, 1
minutes,, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
dumb,, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
the, 1
beating, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
heart., 1
For, 1
him, 1
those, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
were, 1
very, 1
long., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
Albert,, 1
returning, 1
from, 1
his, 1
meeting, 1
with, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
perceived, 1
his, 1
father, 1
watching, 1
for, 1
his, 1
arrival, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
curtain,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
aside., 1
The, 1
count's, 1
eye, 1
expanded;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
insulted, 1
the, 1
count, 1
dreadfully,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
in, 1
every, 1
country, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
such, 1
an, 1
insult, 1
would, 1
lead, 1
to, 1
a, 1
deadly, 1
duel., 1
Albert, 1
returned, 1
safely--then, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
revenged., 1
An, 1
indescribable, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
illumined, 1
that, 1
wretched, 1
countenance, 1
like, 1
the, 1
last, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
before, 1
it, 1
disappears, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
clouds, 1
which, 1
bear, 1
the, 1
aspect,, 1
not, 1
of, 1
a, 1
downy, 1
couch,, 1
but, 1
of, 1
a, 1
tomb., 1
But, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
he, 1
waited, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
for, 1
his, 1
son, 1
to, 1
come, 1
to, 1
his, 1
apartment, 1
with, 1
the, 1
account, 1
of, 1
his, 1
triumph., 1
He, 1
easily, 1
understood, 1
why, 1
his, 1
son, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him, 1
before, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
avenge, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
honor;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
that, 1
was, 1
done,, 1
why, 1
did, 1
not, 1
his, 1
son, 1
come, 1
and, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
into, 1
his, 1
arms?, 1
It, 1
was, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
count, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
Albert,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
his, 1
servant,, 1
who, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
was, 1
authorized, 1
not, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
anything, 1
from, 1
him., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards,, 1
General, 1
Morcerf, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
in, 1
a, 1
black, 1
coat, 1
with, 1
a, 1
military, 1
collar,, 1
black, 1
pantaloons,, 1
and, 1
black, 1
gloves., 1
He, 1
had, 1
apparently, 1
given, 1
previous, 1
orders,, 1
for, 1
as, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
step, 1
his, 1
carriage, 1
came, 1
from, 1
the, 1
coach-house, 1
ready, 1
for, 1
him., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
threw, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
his, 1
military, 1
cloak,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
two, 1
swords, 1
were, 1
wrapped,, 1
and,, 1
shutting, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coachman., 1
The, 1
coachman, 1
stooped, 1
down, 1
for, 1
his, 1
orders., 1
"To, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
general;, 1
"the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's., 1
Hurry!", 1
The, 1
horses, 1
bounded, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
whip;, 1
and, 1
in, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
they, 1
stopped, 1
before, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
door., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
away, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
walk,, 1
rang,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
open, 1
door, 1
with, 1
his, 1
servant., 1
A, 1
moment, 1
afterwards,, 1
Baptistin, 1
announced, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
leading, 1
Haidee, 1
aside,, 1
ordered, 1
that, 1
Morcerf, 1
be, 1
asked, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room., 1
The, 1
general, 1
was, 1
pacing, 1
the, 1
room, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time, 1
when,, 1
in, 1
turning,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Ah,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
quietly;, 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
heard, 1
aright.", 1
"Yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
I,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
whom, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
contraction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
prevented, 1
from, 1
articulating, 1
freely., 1
"May, 1
I, 1
know, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
which, 1
procures, 1
me, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
so, 1
early?", 1
"Had, 1
you, 1
not, 1
a, 1
meeting, 1
with, 1
my, 1
son, 1
this, 1
morning?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
general., 1
"I, 1
had,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
know, 1
my, 1
son, 1
had, 1
good, 1
reasons, 1
to, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
fight, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
you.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
very, 1
good, 1
ones;, 1
but, 1
you, 1
see, 1
that, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
them, 1
he, 1
has, 1
not, 1
killed, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
fight.", 1
"Yet, 1
he, 1
considered, 1
you, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
dishonor,, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fearful, 1
ruin, 1
which, 1
has, 1
fallen, 1
on, 1
my, 1
house.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
his, 1
dreadful, 1
calmness;, 1
"a, 1
secondary, 1
cause,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
the, 1
principal.", 1
"Doubtless, 1
you, 1
made,, 1
then,, 1
some, 1
apology, 1
or, 1
explanation?", 1
"I, 1
explained, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
is, 1
he, 1
who, 1
apologized, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
to, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
attribute, 1
this, 1
conduct?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
conviction,, 1
probably,, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
one, 1
more, 1
guilty, 1
than, 1
I.", 1
"And, 1
who, 1
was, 1
that?", 1
"His, 1
father.", 1
"That, 1
may, 1
be,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
turning, 1
pale;, 1
"but, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
guilty, 1
do, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1
find, 1
themselves, 1
convicted.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
expected, 1
this, 1
result.", 1
"You, 1
expected, 1
my, 1
son, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
coward?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"M., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
is, 1
no, 1
coward!", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"A, 1
man, 1
who, 1
holds, 1
a, 1
sword, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
sees, 1
a, 1
mortal, 1
enemy, 1
within, 1
reach, 1
of, 1
that, 1
sword,, 1
and, 1
does, 1
not, 1
fight,, 1
is, 1
a, 1
coward!, 1
Why, 1
is, 1
he, 1
not, 1
here, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
so?", 1
"Sir.", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
coldly,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
expect, 1
that, 1
you, 1
had, 1
come, 1
here, 1
to, 1
relate, 1
to, 1
me, 1
your, 1
little, 1
family, 1
affairs., 1
Go, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
M., 1
Albert, 1
that,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
may, 1
know, 1
what, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
general,, 1
smiling, 1
faintly,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
for, 1
that, 1
purpose;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right., 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
also, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
you, 1
as, 1
my, 1
enemy., 1
I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
I, 1
hate, 1
you, 1
instinctively;, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seems, 1
as, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
always, 1
known, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
always, 1
hated, 1
you;, 1
and,, 1
in, 1
short,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
young, 1
people, 1
of, 1
the, 1
present, 1
day, 1
will, 1
not, 1

it, 1
remains, 1
for, 1
us, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so,, 1
sir?", 1
"Certainly., 1
And, 1
when, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
I, 1
had, 1
foreseen, 1
the, 1
result,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
your, 1
visit, 1
I, 1
alluded, 1
to.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
prepared?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
fight, 1
till, 1
one, 1
of, 1
us, 1
is, 1
dead,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
general,, 1
whose, 1
teeth, 1
were, 1
clinched, 1
with, 1
rage., 1
"Until, 1
one, 1
of, 1
us, 1
dies,", 1
repeated, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
moving, 1
his, 1
head, 1
slightly, 1
up, 1
and, 1
down., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
start,, 1
then;, 1
we, 1
need, 1
no, 1
witnesses.", 1
"Very, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
unnecessary,, 1
we, 1
know, 1
each, 1
other, 1
so, 1
well!", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1
"we, 1
know, 1
so, 1
little, 1
of, 1
each, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
the, 1

indomitable, 1
coolness;, 1

us, 1

pale;, 1

eye, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1

with, 1
a, 1
devouring, 1
fire., 1

leaped, 1
towards, 1
a, 1
dressing-room, 1
near, 1

bedroom,, 1

in, 1
less, 1
than, 1

moment,, 1
tearing, 1
off, 1
his, 1
cravat,, 1
his, 1

put, 1
on, 1

hat,, 1
from, 1
beneath, 1

implacable,, 1

thrown, 1
back,, 1
hands, 1
extended,, 1
gaze, 1
fixed,, 1

dreadful, 1
apparition;, 1

seeking, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
to, 1
support, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
glided, 1
along, 1
close, 1
to, 1
it, 1

he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out, 1
backwards,, 1
uttering, 1
this, 1
single, 1
mournful,, 1
lamentable,, 1
distressing, 1
cry,--"Edmond, 1
Dantes!", 1
Then,, 1
with, 1
sighs, 1
which, 1
were, 1

human, 1
sound,, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
himself, 1
to, 1

door,, 1
reeled, 1
across, 1
the, 1
court-yard,, 1
and, 1
falling, 1
into, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
his, 1
valet,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
scarcely, 1
intelligible,--"Home,, 1
home.", 1
The, 1
fresh, 1
air, 1
and, 1
the, 1
shame, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
at, 1
having, 1
exposed, 1
himself, 1
before, 1
his, 1
servants,, 1
partly, 1
recalled, 1
his, 1
senses,, 1

the, 1
ride, 1
was, 1
short,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
his, 1
house, 1
all, 1
his, 1
wretchedness, 1
revived., 1
He, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
and, 1
alighted., 1
The, 1
door, 1
was, 1
wide, 1
open,, 1
a, 1
hackney-coach, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
middle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yard--a, 1
strange, 1
sight, 1
before, 1
so, 1
noble, 1
a, 1
mansion;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
it, 1
with, 1
terror,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
daring, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
its, 1
meaning,, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
apartment., 1
Two, 1
persons, 1
were, 1
coming, 1
down, 1
the, 1
stairs;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
time, 1
to, 1
creep, 1
into, 1
an, 1
alcove, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
them., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Mercedes, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
house., 1
They, 1
passed, 1
close, 1
by, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
being,, 1
who,, 1
concealed, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
damask, 1
curtain,, 1
almost, 1
felt, 1
Mercedes, 1
dress, 1
brush, 1
past, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
son's, 1
warm, 1
breath,, 1
pronouncing, 1
these, 1
words,--"Courage,, 1
mother!, 1
Come,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
our, 1
home!", 1

words, 1
died, 1
away,, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
distance., 1
The, 1
general, 1
drew, 1
himself, 1
up,, 1
clinging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
curtain;, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
the, 1
most, 1
dreadful, 1
sob, 1
which, 1
ever, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bosom, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
abandoned, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
by, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
son., 1
He, 1
soon, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
clatter, 1
of, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
step, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hackney-coach,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
coachman's, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
rolling, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heavy, 1
vehicle, 1
shook, 1
the, 1
windows., 1
He, 1
darted, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bedroom, 1
to, 1
see, 1
once, 1
more, 1
all, 1
he, 1
had, 1
loved, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
hackney-coach, 1
drove, 1
on, 1
and, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
neither, 1
Mercedes, 1
nor, 1
her, 1
son, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
last, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house, 1
or, 1
the, 1
deserted, 1
father, 1
and, 1
husband., 1
And, 1
at, 1
the, 1
very, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
the, 1
wheels, 1
of, 1
that, 1
coach, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
gateway, 1
a, 1
report, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
thick, 1
smoke, 1
escaped, 1
through, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
panes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
broken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
explosion., 1
Chapter, 1
93., 1
Valentine., 1
We, 1
may, 1
easily, 1
conceive, 1
where, 1
Morrel's, 1
appointment, 1
was., 1
On, 1
leaving, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
he, 1
walked, 1
slowly, 1
towards, 1
Villefort's;, 1
we, 1
say, 1
slowly,, 1
for, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
more, 1
than, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
to, 1
spare, 1
to, 1
go, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
steps,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
had, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
take, 1
leave, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
because, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
his, 1
thoughts., 1
He, 1
knew, 1
his, 1
time, 1
well--the, 1
hour, 1
when, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
giving, 1
Noirtier, 1
his, 1
breakfast,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
sure, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
disturbed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
performance, 1
of, 1
this, 1
pious, 1
duty., 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
given, 1
him, 1
leave, 1
to, 1
go, 1
twice, 1
a, 1
week,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
now, 1
availing, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
that, 1
permission., 1
He, 1
had, 1
arrived;, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
expecting, 1
him., 1
Uneasy, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
crazed,, 1
she, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
led, 1
him, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandfather., 1
This, 1
uneasiness,, 1
amounting, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
frenzy,, 1
arose, 1
from, 1
the, 1
report, 1
Morcerf's, 1
adventure, 1
had, 1
made, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
at, 1
the, 1
opera, 1
was, 1
generally, 1
known., 1
No, 1
one, 1
at, 1
Villefort's, 1
doubted, 1
that, 1
a, 1
duel, 1
would, 1
ensue, 1
from, 1
it., 1
Valentine,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
woman's, 1
instinct,, 1
guessed, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
would, 1
be, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
second,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
well-known, 1
courage, 1
and, 1
his, 1
great, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
she, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
content, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
the, 1
passive, 1
part, 1
assigned, 1
to, 1
him., 1
We, 1
may, 1
easily, 1
understand, 1
how, 1
eagerly, 1
the, 1
particulars, 1
were, 1
asked, 1
for,, 1
given,, 1
and, 1
received;, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
could, 1
read, 1
an, 1
indescribable, 1
joy, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
beloved,, 1
when, 1
she, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
the, 1
termination, 1
of, 1
this, 1
affair, 1
was, 1
as, 1
happy, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
unexpected., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
motioning, 1
to, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
sit, 1
down, 1
near, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
while, 1
she, 1
took, 1
her, 1
seat, 1
on, 1
his, 1
footstool,--"now, 1
let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
about, 1
our, 1
own, 1
affairs., 1
You, 1
know,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
grandpapa, 1
once, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
leaving, 1
this, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
an, 1
apartment, 1
away, 1
from, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"I, 1
recollect, 1
the, 1
project,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
I, 1
highly, 1
approved.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"you, 1
may, 1
approve, 1
again,, 1
for, 1
grandpapa, 1
is, 1
again, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"Bravo,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian., 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"what, 1
reason, 1
grandpapa, 1
gives, 1
for, 1
leaving, 1
this, 1
house.", 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
impose, 1
silence,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
notice, 1
him;, 1
her, 1
looks,, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
her, 1
smile,, 1
were, 1
all, 1
for, 1
Morrel., 1
"Oh,, 1
whatever, 1
may, 1
be, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
reason,", 1
answered, 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
can, 1
readily, 1
believe, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
good, 1
one.", 1
"An, 1
excellent, 1
one,", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"He, 1
pretends, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
St., 1
Honore, 1
is, 1
not, 1
good, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"in, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
may, 1
be, 1
right;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
well, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fortnight.", 1
"Not, 1
very,", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"And, 1
grandpapa, 1
has, 1
become, 1
my, 1
physician,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
confidence, 1
in, 1
him,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
knows, 1
everything.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
then, 1
really, 1
suffer?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel, 1
quickly., 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
not, 1
be, 1
called, 1
suffering;, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
a, 1
general, 1
uneasiness,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all., 1
I, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
my, 1
appetite,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
stomach, 1
feels, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
struggling, 1
to, 1
get, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
something.", 1
Noirtier, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
word, 1
of, 1
what, 1
Valentine, 1
said., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
treatment, 1
do, 1
you, 1
adopt, 1
for, 1
this, 1
singular, 1
complaint?", 1
"A, 1
very, 1
simple, 1
one,", 1
said, 1
Valentine., 1
"I, 1
swallow, 1
every, 1
morning, 1
a, 1
spoonful, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mixture, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
my, 1
grandfather., 1
When, 1
I, 1
say, 1
one, 1
spoonful,, 1
I, 1
began, 1
by, 1
one--now, 1
I, 1
take, 1
four., 1
Grandpapa, 1
says, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
panacea.", 1
Valentine, 1
smiled,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
evident, 1
that, 1
she, 1
suffered., 1
Maximilian,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
devotedness,, 1
gazed, 1
silently, 1
at, 1
her., 1
She, 1
was, 1
very, 1
beautiful,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
pallor, 1
had, 1
increased;, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
more, 1
brilliant, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
generally, 1
white, 1
like, 1
mother-of-pearl,, 1
now, 1
more, 1
resembled, 1
wax,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
time, 1
was, 1
adding, 1
a, 1
yellowish, 1
hue., 1
From, 1
Valentine, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
looked, 1
towards, 1
Noirtier., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
watched, 1
with, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
deep, 1
interest, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
absorbed, 1
by, 1
her, 1
affection,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
also,, 1
like, 1
Morrel,, 1
followed, 1
those, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
inward, 1
suffering, 1
which, 1
was, 1
so, 1
little, 1
perceptible, 1
to, 1
a, 1
common, 1
observer, 1
that, 1
they, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
notice, 1
of, 1
every, 1
one, 1
but, 1
the, 1
grandfather, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lover., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
mixture,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
now, 1
take, 1
four, 1
spoonfuls,, 1
was, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
bitter,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"so, 1
bitter,, 1
that, 1
all, 1
I, 1
drink, 1
afterwards, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
have, 1
the, 1
same, 1
taste.", 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
inquiringly, 1
at, 1
his, 1
granddaughter., 1
"Yes,, 1
grandpapa,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
so., 1
Just, 1
now,, 1
before, 1
I, 1
came, 1
down, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
drank, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
sugared, 1
water;, 1
I, 1
left, 1
half,, 1
because, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
so, 1
bitter.", 1
Noirtier, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak., 1
Valentine, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
the, 1
dictionary., 1
Noirtier, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
with, 1
evident, 1
anguish., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
was, 1
rushing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
head, 1
already,, 1
her, 1
cheeks, 1
were, 1
becoming, 1
red., 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
without, 1
losing, 1
any, 1
of, 1
her, 1
cheerfulness,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
singular!, 1
I, 1
can't, 1
see!, 1
Did, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
shine, 1
in, 1
my, 1
eyes?", 1
And, 1
she, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
the, 1
window., 1
"The, 1
sun, 1
is, 1
not, 1
shining,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
more, 1
alarmed, 1
by, 1
Noirtier's, 1
expression, 1
than, 1
by, 1
Valentine's, 1
indisposition., 1
He, 1
ran, 1
towards, 1
her., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
smiled., 1
"Cheer, 1
up,", 1
said, 1
she, 1
to, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
already, 1
passed, 1
away., 1
But, 1
listen!, 1
Do, 1
I, 1
not, 1
hear, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
in, 1
the, 1
court-yard?", 1
She, 1
opened, 1
Noirtier's, 1
door,, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
a, 1
window, 1
in, 1
the, 1
passage,, 1
and, 1
returned, 1
hastily., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
come, 1
to, 1
call, 1
on, 1
us., 1
Good-by;--I, 1
must, 1
run, 1
away,, 1
for, 1
they, 1
would, 1
send, 1
here, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
or,, 1
rather,, 1
farewell, 1
till, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again., 1
Stay, 1
with, 1
grandpapa,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
I, 1
promise, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
persuade, 1
them, 1
to, 1
stay.", 1
Morrel, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
as, 1
she, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room;, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
her, 1
ascend, 1
the, 1
little, 1
staircase, 1
which, 1
led, 1
both, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
apartments, 1
and, 1
to, 1
hers., 1
As, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
gone,, 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
dictionary., 1
Morrel, 1
obeyed;, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
Valentine,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
how, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
quickly., 1
Accustomed,, 1
however,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
to, 1
the, 1
work,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
most, 1
of, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
alphabet, 1
and, 1
to, 1
find, 1
every, 1
word, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dictionary,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
before, 1
the, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
was, 1
translated, 1
by, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
"Fetch, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
water, 1
and, 1
the, 1
decanter, 1
from, 1
Valentine's, 1
room.", 1
Morrel, 1
rang, 1
immediately, 1
for, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
who, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
Barrois's, 1
situation,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
Noirtier's, 1
name, 1
gave, 1
that, 1
order., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
soon, 1
returned., 1
The, 1
decanter, 1
and, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
were, 1
completely, 1
empty., 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak., 1
"Why, 1
are, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
and, 1
decanter, 1
empty?", 1
asked, 1
he;, 1
"Valentine, 1
said, 1
she, 1
only, 1
drank, 1
half, 1
the, 1
glassful.", 1
The, 1
translation, 1
of, 1
this, 1
new, 1
question, 1
occupied, 1
another, 1
five, 1
minutes., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
servant,, 1
"but, 1
the, 1
housemaid, 1
is, 1
in, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine's, 1
room:, 1
perhaps, 1
she, 1
has, 1
emptied, 1
them.", 1
"Ask, 1
her,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
translating, 1
Noirtier's, 1
thought, 1
this, 1
time, 1
by, 1
his, 1
look., 1
The, 1
servant, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
but, 1
returned, 1
almost, 1
immediately., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
room, 1
to, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"and, 1
in, 1
passing,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was, 1
thirsty,, 1
she, 1
drank, 1
what, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
glass;, 1
as, 1
for, 1
the, 1
decanter,, 1
Master, 1
Edward, 1
had, 1
emptied, 1
that, 1
to, 1
make, 1
a, 1
pond, 1
for, 1
his, 1
ducks.", 1
Noirtier, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
gambler, 1
does, 1
who, 1
stakes, 1
his, 1
all, 1
on, 1
one, 1
stroke., 1
From, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
quit, 1
it., 1
It, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
whom, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
seen;, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
ushered, 1
into, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
room,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
said, 1
she, 1
would, 1
receive, 1
them, 1
there., 1
That, 1
is, 1
why, 1
Valentine, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
on, 1
a, 1
level, 1
with, 1
Valentine's,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
it, 1
by, 1
Edward's., 1
The, 1
two, 1
ladies, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
with, 1
that, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
official, 1
stiffness, 1
which, 1
preludes, 1
a, 1
formal, 1
communication., 1
Among, 1
worldly, 1
people, 1
manner, 1
is, 1
contagious., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
received, 1
them, 1
with, 1
equal, 1
solemnity., 1
Valentine, 1
entered, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
formalities, 1
were, 1
resumed., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
people, 1
were, 1
shaking, 1
hands,, 1
"I, 1
and, 1
Eugenie, 1
are, 1
come, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
first, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
with, 1
Prince, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
Danglars, 1
kept, 1
up, 1
the, 1
title, 1
of, 1
prince., 1
The, 1
popular, 1
banker, 1
found, 1
that, 1
it, 1
answered, 1
better, 1
than, 1
count., 1
"Allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
present, 1
you, 1
my, 1
sincere, 1
congratulations,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"Prince, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
rare, 1
qualities.", 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
smiling;, 1
"speaking, 1
to, 1
you, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
I, 1
can, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
prince, 1
does, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
appear, 1
all, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be., 1
He, 1
has, 1
about, 1
him, 1
a, 1
little, 1
of, 1
that, 1
foreign, 1
manner, 1
by, 1
which, 1
French, 1
persons, 1
recognize,, 1
at, 1
first, 1
sight,, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
or, 1
German, 1
nobleman., 1
Besides,, 1
he, 1
gives, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
great, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
disposition,, 1
much, 1
keenness, 1
of, 1
wit,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
to, 1
suitability,, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
assures, 1
me, 1
that, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
is, 1
majestic--that, 1
is, 1
his, 1
word.", 1
"And, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
while, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
album,, 1
"add, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
a, 1
great, 1
fancy, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man.", 1
"And,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
"I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
if, 1
you, 1
share, 1
that, 1
fancy.", 1
"I?", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie, 1
with, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
candor., 1
"Oh,, 1
not, 1
the, 1
least, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
madame!, 1
My, 1
wish, 1
was, 1
not, 1
to, 1
confine, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
domestic, 1
cares,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
caprices, 1
of, 1
any, 1
man,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
be, 1
an, 1
artist,, 1
and, 1
consequently, 1
free, 1
in, 1
heart,, 1
in, 1
person,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
thought.", 1
Eugenie, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
so, 1
firm, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
the, 1
color, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
Valentine's, 1
cheeks., 1
The, 1
timid, 1
girl, 1
could, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
vigorous, 1
nature, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
none, 1
of, 1
the, 1
timidities, 1
of, 1
woman., 1
"At, 1
any, 1
rate,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"since, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married, 1
whether, 1
I, 1
will, 1
or, 1
not,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
thankful, 1
to, 1
providence, 1
for, 1
having, 1
released, 1
me, 1
from, 1
my, 1
engagement, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
or, 1
I, 1
should, 1
this, 1
day, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dishonored, 1
man.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
strange, 1
simplicity, 1
sometimes, 1
met, 1
with, 1
among, 1
fashionable, 1
ladies,, 1
and, 1
of, 1
which, 1
plebeian, 1
intercourse, 1
can, 1
never, 1
entirely, 1
deprive, 1
them,--"it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
true, 1
that, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Morcerfs, 1
hesitated,, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
would, 1
have, 1
married, 1
Monsieur, 1
Albert., 1
The, 1
general, 1
depended, 1
much, 1
on, 1
it;, 1
he, 1
even, 1
came, 1
to, 1
force, 1
M., 1
Danglars., 1
We, 1
have, 1
had, 1
a, 1
narrow, 1
escape.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
timidly,, 1
"does, 1
all, 1
the, 1
father's, 1
shame, 1
revert, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
son?, 1
Monsieur, 1
Albert, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
me, 1
quite, 1
innocent, 1
of, 1
the, 1
treason, 1
charged, 1
against, 1
the, 1
general.", 1
"Excuse, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
implacable, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
"Monsieur, 1
Albert, 1
claims, 1
and, 1
well, 1
deserves, 1
his, 1
share., 1
It, 1
appears, 1
that, 1
after, 1
having, 1
challenged, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Opera, 1
yesterday,, 1
he, 1
apologized, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
to-day.", 1
"Impossible,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
simplicity, 1
we, 1
before, 1
noticed,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
fact., 1
I, 1
heard, 1
it, 1
from, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
present, 1
at, 1
the, 1
explanation.", 1
Valentine, 1
also, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
truth,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
A, 1
single, 1
word, 1
had, 1
reminded, 1
her, 1
that, 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
expecting, 1
her, 1
in, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
room., 1
Deeply, 1
engaged, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
inward, 1
contemplation,, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
ceased, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
join, 1
in, 1
the, 1
conversation., 1
She, 1
would,, 1
indeed,, 1
have, 1
found, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
repeat, 1
what, 1
had, 1
been, 1
said, 1
the, 1
last, 1
few, 1
minutes,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
hand,, 1
pressed, 1
on, 1
her, 1
arm,, 1
aroused, 1
her, 1
from, 1
her, 1
lethargy., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
starting, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
touch, 1
as, 1
she, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
from, 1
an, 1
electric, 1
shock., 1
"It, 1
is,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
doubtless,, 1
suffering.", 1
"I?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
passing, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
her, 1
burning, 1
forehead., 1
"Yes,, 1
look, 1
at, 1
yourself, 1
in, 1
that, 1
glass;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
turned, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
then, 1
red, 1
successively,, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
times, 1
in, 1
one, 1
minute.", 1
"Indeed,", 1
cried, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
very, 1
pale!", 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
for, 1
many, 1
days.", 1
Artless, 1
as, 1
she, 1
was,, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
to, 1
leave,, 1
and, 1
besides,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
came, 1
to, 1
her, 1
assistance., 1
"Retire,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
really, 1
suffering,, 1
and, 1
these, 1
ladies, 1
will, 1
excuse, 1
you;, 1
drink, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
pure, 1
water,, 1
it, 1
will, 1
restore, 1
you.", 1
Valentine, 1
kissed, 1
Eugenie,, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
already, 1
risen, 1
to, 1
take, 1
her, 1
leave,, 1
and, 1
went, 1
out., 1
"That, 1
poor, 1
child,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
when, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
gone,, 1
"she, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
very, 1
uneasy,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
be, 1
astonished, 1
if, 1
she, 1
had, 1
some, 1
serious, 1
illness.", 1
Meanwhile,, 1
Valentine,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
excitement, 1
which, 1
she, 1
could, 1
not, 1
quite, 1
understand,, 1
had, 1
crossed, 1
Edward's, 1
room, 1
without, 1
noticing, 1
some, 1
trick, 1
of, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
and, 1
through, 1
her, 1
own, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
little, 1
staircase., 1
She, 1
was, 1
within, 1
three, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bottom;, 1
she, 1
already, 1
heard, 1
Morrel's, 1
voice,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
a, 1
cloud, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
her, 1
stiffened, 1
foot, 1
missed, 1
the, 1
step,, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
had, 1
no, 1
power, 1
to, 1
hold, 1
the, 1
baluster,, 1
and, 1
falling, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
she, 1
lost, 1
her, 1
balance, 1
wholly, 1
and, 1
toppled, 1
to, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
Morrel, 1
bounded, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
opened, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
Valentine, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bottom, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
Quick, 1
as, 1
a, 1
flash,, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
her, 1
in, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
Valentine, 1
opened, 1
her, 1
eyes., 1
"Oh,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
clumsy, 1
thing, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
said, 1
she, 1
with, 1
feverish, 1
volubility;, 1
"I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
my, 1
way., 1
I, 1
forgot, 1
there, 1
were, 1
three, 1
more, 1
steps, 1
before, 1
the, 1
landing.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
hurt, 1
yourself,, 1
perhaps,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"What, 1
can, 1
I, 1
do, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
Valentine?", 1
Valentine, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
her;, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
terror, 1
depicted, 1
in, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes., 1
"Don't, 1
worry,, 1
dear, 1
grandpapa,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
smile;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
nothing--it, 1
is, 1
nothing;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
giddy,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
"Another, 1
attack, 1
of, 1
giddiness,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"Oh,, 1
attend, 1
to, 1
it,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
you.", 1
"But, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,--"no,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
it, 1
is, 1
all, 1
past,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
nothing., 1
Now,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
some, 1
news;, 1
Eugenie, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married, 1
in, 1
a, 1
week,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
three, 1
days, 1
there, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
grand, 1
feast,, 1
a, 1
betrothal, 1
festival., 1
We, 1
are, 1
all, 1
invited,, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
I--at, 1
least,, 1
I, 1
understood, 1
it, 1
so.", 1
"When, 1
will, 1
it, 1
be, 1
our, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
these, 1
things?, 1
Oh,, 1
Valentine,, 1
you, 1
who, 1
have, 1
so, 1
much, 1
influence, 1
over, 1
your, 1
grandpapa,, 1
try, 1
to, 1
make, 1
him, 1
answer--Soon.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"depend, 1
on, 1
me, 1
to, 1
stimulate, 1
the, 1
tardiness, 1
and, 1
arouse, 1
the, 1
memory, 1
of, 1
grandpapa?", 1
"Yes,", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
"make, 1
haste., 1
So, 1
long, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
mine,, 1
Valentine,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
always, 1
think, 1
I, 1
may, 1
lose, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,", 1
replied, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
a, 1
convulsive, 1
movement,, 1
"oh,, 1
indeed,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
too, 1
timid, 1
for, 1
an, 1
officer,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
soldier, 1
who,, 1
they, 1
say,, 1
never, 1
knows, 1
fear., 1
Ah,, 1
ha,, 1
ha!", 1
she, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
forced, 1
and, 1
melancholy, 1
laugh,, 1
her, 1
arms, 1
stiffened, 1
and, 1
twisted,, 1
her, 1
head, 1
fell, 1
back, 1
on, 1
her, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
remained, 1
motionless., 1
The, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
terror, 1
which, 1
was, 1
stopped, 1
on, 1
Noirtier's, 1
lips,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
start, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
Morrel, 1
understood, 1
it;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
he, 1
must, 1
call, 1
assistance., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
violently;, 1
the, 1
housemaid, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
in, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine's, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
servant, 1
who, 1
had, 1
replaced, 1
Barrois,, 1
ran, 1
in, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
so, 1
pale,, 1
so, 1
cold,, 1
so, 1
inanimate, 1
that, 1
without, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
what, 1
was, 1
said, 1
to, 1
them, 1
they, 1
were, 1
seized, 1
with, 1
the, 1
fear, 1
which, 1
pervaded, 1
that, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
flew, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
crying, 1
for, 1
help., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Eugenie, 1
were, 1
going, 1
out, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment;, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disturbance., 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
so!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"Poor, 1
child!", 1
Chapter, 1
94., 1
Maximilian's, 1
Avowal., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
calling, 1
from, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Noirtier, 1
who, 1
had, 1
recovered, 1
his, 1
self-command,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
indicated, 1
the, 1
closet, 1
where, 1
once, 1
before, 1
under, 1
somewhat, 1
similar, 1
circumstances,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
refuge., 1
He, 1
had, 1
only, 1
time, 1
to, 1
get, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
and, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
breathless, 1
into, 1
the, 1
closet, 1
when, 1
the, 1
procureur's, 1
footstep, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
passage., 1
Villefort, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
"A, 1
physician,, 1
a, 1
physician,--M., 1
d'Avrigny!", 1
cried, 1
Villefort;, 1
"or, 1
rather, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
for, 1
him, 1
myself.", 1
He, 1
flew, 1
from, 1
the, 1
apartment,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
moment, 1
darted, 1
out, 1
at, 1
the, 1
other, 1
door., 1
He, 1
had, 1
been, 1
struck, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
by, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
recollection--the, 1
conversation, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
between, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
death,, 1
recurred, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
these, 1
symptoms,, 1
to, 1
a, 1
less, 1
alarming, 1
extent,, 1
were, 1
the, 1
same, 1
which, 1
had, 1
preceded, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Barrois., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
voice, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
resound, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
with, 1
the, 1
words, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
only, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
before,, 1
"Whatever, 1
you, 1
want,, 1
Morrel,, 1
come, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
great, 1
power.", 1
More, 1
rapidly, 1
than, 1
thought,, 1
he, 1
darted, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Matignon,, 1
and, 1
thence, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Avenue, 1
des, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees., 1
Meanwhile, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
arrived, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hired, 1
cabriolet, 1
at, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny's, 1
door., 1
He, 1
rang, 1
so, 1
violently, 1
that, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
was, 1
alarmed., 1
Villefort, 1
ran, 1
up-stairs, 1
without, 1
saying, 1
a, 1
word., 1
The, 1
porter, 1
knew, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
let, 1
him, 1
pass,, 1
only, 1
calling, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
"In, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
Monsieur, 1
Procureur--in, 1
his, 1
study!", 1
Villefort, 1
pushed,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
forced,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
open., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
you?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
closing, 1
the, 1
door, 1
after, 1
him,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
I,, 1
who, 1
am, 1
come, 1
in, 1
my, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
if, 1
we, 1
are, 1
quite, 1
alone., 1
Doctor,, 1
my, 1
house, 1
is, 1
accursed!", 1
"What?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
with, 1
apparent, 1
coolness,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
deep, 1
emotion,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
another, 1
invalid?", 1
"Yes,, 1
doctor,", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
clutching, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
"yes!", 1
D'Avrigny's, 1
look, 1
implied,, 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
so.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
slowly, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
"Who, 1
is, 1
now, 1
dying, 1
in, 1
your, 1
house?, 1
What, 1
new, 1
victim, 1
is, 1
going, 1
to, 1
accuse, 1
you, 1
of, 1
weakness, 1
before, 1
God?", 1
A, 1
mournful, 1
sob, 1
burst, 1
from, 1
Villefort's, 1
heart;, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
and, 1
seizing, 1
his, 1
arm,--"Valentine,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
Valentine's, 1
turn!", 1
"Your, 1
daughter?", 1
cried, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
with, 1
grief, 1
and, 1
surprise., 1
"You, 1
see, 1
you, 1
were, 1
deceived,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
magistrate;, 1
"come, 1
and, 1
see, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
on, 1
her, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
agony, 1
entreat, 1
her, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
having, 1
suspected, 1
her.", 1
"Each, 1
time, 1
you, 1
have, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor,, 1
"it, 1
has, 1
been, 1
too, 1
late;, 1
still, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go., 1
But, 1
let, 1
us, 1
make, 1
haste,, 1
sir;, 1
with, 1
the, 1
enemies, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
be, 1
lost.", 1
"Oh,, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
doctor,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
have, 1
to, 1
reproach, 1
me, 1
with, 1
weakness., 1
This, 1
time, 1
I, 1
will, 1
know, 1
the, 1
assassin,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
pursue, 1
him.", 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
try, 1
first, 1
to, 1
save, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
before, 1
we, 1
think, 1
of, 1
revenging, 1
her,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Come.", 1
The, 1
same, 1
cabriolet, 1
which, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
Villefort, 1
took, 1
them, 1
back, 1
at, 1
full, 1
speed,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Morrel, 1
rapped, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
door., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study, 1
and, 1
was, 1
reading, 1
with, 1
an, 1
angry, 1
look, 1
something, 1
which, 1
Bertuccio, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
in, 1
haste., 1
Hearing, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
left, 1
him, 1
only, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
before,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
sprang, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
asked, 1
he;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
rolls, 1
from, 1
your, 1
forehead.", 1
Morrel, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
quickly;, 1
I, 1
wanted, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Are, 1
all, 1
your, 1
family, 1
well?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
affectionate, 1
benevolence,, 1
whose, 1
sincerity, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
doubt., 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
count--thank, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
evidently, 1
embarrassed, 1
how, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
the, 1
conversation;, 1
"yes,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
in, 1
my, 1
family, 1
is, 1
well.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better;, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
have, 1
something, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
increased, 1
anxiety., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
true;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
now, 1
left, 1
a, 1
house, 1
where, 1
death, 1
has, 1
just, 1
entered,, 1
to, 1
run, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
then, 1
come, 1
from, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf's?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"is, 1
some, 1
one, 1
dead, 1
in, 1
his, 1
house?", 1
"The, 1
general, 1
has, 1
just, 1
blown, 1
his, 1
brains, 1
out,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
great, 1
coolness., 1
"Oh,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
event!", 1
cried, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Not, 1
for, 1
the, 1
countess,, 1
or, 1
for, 1
Albert,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"a, 1
dead, 1
father, 1
or, 1
husband, 1
is, 1
better, 1
than, 1
a, 1
dishonored, 1
one,--blood, 1
washes, 1
out, 1
shame.", 1
"Poor, 1
countess,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"I, 1
pity, 1
her, 1
very, 1
much;, 1
she, 1
is, 1
so, 1
noble, 1
a, 1
woman!", 1
"Pity, 1
Albert, 1
also,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
for, 1
believe, 1
me, 1
he, 1
is, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
son, 1
of, 1
the, 1
countess., 1
But, 1
let, 1
us, 1
return, 1
to, 1
yourself., 1
You, 1
have, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
me--can, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
of, 1
being, 1
useful, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
need, 1
your, 1
help:, 1
that, 1
is, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
like, 1
a, 1
madman, 1
that, 1
you, 1
could, 1
lend, 1
me, 1
your, 1
assistance, 1
in, 1
a, 1
case, 1
where, 1
God, 1
alone, 1
can, 1
succor, 1
me.", 1
"Tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
not,, 1
indeed,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
may, 1
reveal, 1
this, 1
secret, 1
to, 1
mortal, 1
ears,, 1
but, 1
fatality, 1
impels, 1
me,, 1
necessity, 1
constrains, 1
me,, 1
count"--Morrel, 1
hesitated., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
I, 1
love, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
hand, 1
affectionately, 1
in, 1
his., 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
encourage, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
something, 1
tells, 1
me, 1
there,", 1
placing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
no, 1
secret, 1
from, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
Morrel;, 1
God, 1
is, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
your, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
heart, 1
speaks, 1
to, 1
you., 1
Tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
it, 1
says.", 1
"Count,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
send, 1
Baptistin, 1
to, 1
inquire, 1
after, 1
some, 1
one, 1
you, 1
know?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
at, 1
your, 1
service,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
my, 1
servants.", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
live, 1
if, 1
she, 1
is, 1
not, 1
better.", 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
ring, 1
for, 1
Baptistin?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
him, 1
myself.", 1
Morrel, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
called, 1
Baptistin,, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
to, 1
him., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
ran, 1
directly., 1
"Well,, 1
have, 1
you, 1
sent?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
seeing, 1
Morrel, 1
return., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
more, 1
calm.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
I, 1
am, 1
waiting,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you., 1
One, 1
evening, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
a, 1
garden;, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
trees, 1
concealed, 1
me;, 1
no, 1
one, 1
suspected, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there., 1
Two, 1
persons, 1
passed, 1
near, 1
me--allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
their, 1
names, 1
for, 1
the, 1
present;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
speaking, 1
in, 1
an, 1
undertone,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
was, 1
so, 1
interested, 1
in, 1
what, 1
they, 1
said, 1
that, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
lose, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word.", 1
"This, 1
is, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
introduction,, 1
if, 1
I, 1
may, 1
judge, 1
from, 1
your, 1
pallor, 1
and, 1
shuddering,, 1
Morrel.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
very, 1
gloomy,, 1
my, 1
friend., 1
Some, 1
one, 1
had, 1
just, 1
died, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house, 1
to, 1
which, 1
that, 1
garden, 1
belonged., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
whose, 1
conversation, 1
I, 1
overheard, 1

the, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
the, 1
physician., 1
The, 1
former, 1
was, 1
confiding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
his, 1
grief, 1
and, 1
fear,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
second, 1
time, 1
within, 1
a, 1
month, 1
that, 1
death, 1
had, 1
suddenly, 1
and, 1
unexpectedly, 1
entered, 1
that, 1
house, 1
which, 1
was, 1
apparently, 1
destined, 1
to, 1
destruction, 1
by, 1
some, 1
exterminating, 1
angel,, 1
as, 1
an, 1
object, 1
of, 1
God's, 1
anger.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
looking, 1
earnestly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
an, 1
imperceptible, 1
movement, 1
turning, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
while, 1
the, 1
light, 1
fell, 1
full, 1
on, 1
Maximilian's, 1
face., 1
"Yes,", 1
continued, 1
Morrel,, 1
"death, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
that, 1
house, 1
twice, 1
within, 1
one, 1
month.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
answer?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"He, 1
replied--he, 1
replied,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
death, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
natural, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
must, 1
be, 1
attributed"--, 1
"To, 1
what?", 1
"To, 1
poison.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
cough, 1
which, 1
in, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
extreme, 1
emotion, 1
helped, 1
him, 1
to, 1
disguise, 1
a, 1
blush,, 1
or, 1
his, 1
pallor,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
intense, 1
interest, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
listened;, 1
"indeed,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
did, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
that?", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
added, 1
that, 1
if, 1
another, 1
death, 1
occurred, 1
in, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
way, 1
he, 1
must, 1
appeal, 1
to, 1
justice.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
listened,, 1
or, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
calmness., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"death, 1
came, 1

No,, 1

Morrel, 1
shuddered., 1
There, 1
was, 1
something, 1
mournful,, 1
solemn,, 1
and, 1
terrible, 1
in, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
manner., 1
"Besides,", 1
continued, 1
he,, 1
in, 1
so, 1
changed, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
would, 1
have, 1
supposed, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
person, 1
speaking--"besides,, 1

that, 1
it, 1

begin, 1
again?", 1
"It, 1
has, 1
returned,, 1

exclaimed, 1
Morrel;, 1
"that, 1

hastened, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Well,, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
uttered, 1
the, 1
last, 1
words, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
meaning, 1
that, 1
Morrel,, 1
starting, 1
up,, 1
cried, 1
out,, 1
"You, 1
know, 1

you, 1

"Perfectly, 1

d'Avrigny, 1
about, 1
the, 1
death, 1

of, 1

d'Avrigny, 1
said, 1

from, 1

and, 1
you,, 1

Deep, 1
grief, 1

Cristo's, 1
hand., 1
"But, 1

Morrel,, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
terror, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1

murderous, 1
nights, 1
of, 1
Algeria,, 1
shaken, 1
around, 1
him, 1
more, 1
dreadful, 1
fire., 1
He, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
terrified., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
after, 1
this, 1
ebullition, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
as, 1
if, 1
dazzled, 1
by, 1
internal, 1
light., 1
In, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
restrained, 1
himself, 1
so, 1
powerfully, 1
that, 1
the, 1
tempestuous, 1
heaving, 1
of, 1
his, 1
breast, 1
subsided,, 1

lasted, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
seconds,, 1
then, 1
the, 1

"my, 1

"How, 1
so?", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
"when, 1
I, 1
left, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
his, 1
forehead., 1
What, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
that, 1
brain,, 1
so, 1
loaded, 1
with, 1
dreadful, 1

angel, 1
of, 1
light, 1

the, 1
angel, 1
of, 1
darkness, 1

at, 1
once, 1
implacable, 1

generous?, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
time, 1
he, 1
was, 1
calm, 1
as, 1

from, 1

indescribable, 1
terror., 1
But, 1

looked, 1
at, 1

so, 1
melancholy, 1

exercised, 1
over, 1

stopped, 1
one, 1
moment, 1
at, 1

was, 1
running., 1

all, 1
possible, 1
haste,, 1

all, 1
the, 1
care, 1
the, 1

with, 1
an, 1
interest, 1

the, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1

intensified, 1
twofold., 1
Villefort,, 1
closely, 1
watching, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
and, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
awaited, 1

also, 1
intently, 1
and, 1
affectionately., 1

last, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
slowly, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words:--"she, 1
is, 1
still, 1
alive!", 1
"Still?", 1

father., 1
"Yes,, 1
since, 1
she, 1
lives.", 1
At, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
d'Avrigny's, 1
glance, 1
met, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eye., 1
It, 1
glistened, 1
with, 1
such, 1
extraordinary, 1
joy,, 1
so, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
full, 1
of, 1
thought,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
physician, 1
was, 1
struck., 1
He, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
again, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chair,--her, 1
lips, 1
were, 1
scarcely, 1
discernible,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
so, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
white,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
face,--and, 1
remained, 1
motionless,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
anticipate, 1
and, 1
commend, 1
all, 1
he, 1
did., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
to, 1
Villefort,, 1
"call, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Valentine's, 1
maid,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please.", 1
Villefort, 1
went, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
find, 1
her;, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
approached, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
something, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
he., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
winked, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
expressively,, 1
which, 1
we, 1
may, 1
remember, 1
was, 1
his, 1
only, 1
way, 1
of, 1
expressing, 1
his, 1
approval., 1
"Privately?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
remain, 1
with, 1
you.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Villefort, 1
returned,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
lady's, 1
maid;, 1
and, 1
after, 1
her, 1
came, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
this, 1
dear, 1
child?, 1
she, 1
has, 1
just, 1
left, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
complained, 1
of, 1
being, 1
indisposed,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
seriously, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
with, 1
tears, 1
in, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
every, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
affection, 1
of, 1
a, 1
true, 1
mother,, 1
approached, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
took, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
look, 1
at, 1
Noirtier;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
dilate, 1
and, 1
become, 1
round,, 1
his, 1
cheeks, 1
turn, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
tremble;, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
drops, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
forehead., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
involuntarily, 1
following, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
repeated,--"This, 1
poor, 1
child, 1
would, 1
be, 1
better, 1
in, 1
bed., 1
Come,, 1
Fanny,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
put, 1
her, 1
to, 1
bed.", 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
who, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
his, 1
remaining, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Noirtier,, 1
expressed, 1
his, 1
opinion, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
best, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
could, 1
be, 1
done;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
forbade, 1
that, 1
anything, 1
should, 1
be, 1
given, 1
to, 1
her, 1
except, 1
what, 1
he, 1
ordered., 1
They, 1
carried, 1
Valentine, 1
away;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
revived,, 1
but, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
move, 1
or, 1
speak,, 1
so, 1
shaken, 1
was, 1
her, 1
frame, 1
by, 1
the, 1
attack., 1
She, 1
had,, 1
however,, 1
just, 1
power, 1
to, 1
give, 1
one, 1
parting, 1
look, 1
to, 1
her, 1
grandfather,, 1
who, 1
in, 1
losing, 1
her, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
resigning, 1
his, 1
very, 1
soul., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
invalid,, 1
wrote, 1
a, 1
prescription,, 1
ordered, 1
Villefort, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
cabriolet,, 1
go, 1
in, 1
person, 1
to, 1
a, 1
chemist's, 1
to, 1
get, 1
the, 1
prescribed, 1
medicine,, 1
bring, 1
it, 1
himself,, 1
and, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
daughter's, 1
room., 1
Then,, 1
having, 1
renewed, 1
his, 1
injunction, 1
not, 1
to, 1
give, 1
Valentine, 1
anything,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
down, 1
again, 1
to, 1
Noirtier,, 1
shut, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
carefully,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
convincing, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
was, 1
listening,--"Do, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"know, 1
anything, 1
of, 1
this, 1
young, 1
lady's, 1
illness?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"We, 1
have, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
lose;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
question,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
you, 1
answer, 1
me.", 1
Noirtier, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
answer., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
anticipate, 1
the, 1
accident, 1
which, 1
has, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
your, 1
granddaughter?", 1
"Yes.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
reflected, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
then, 1
approaching, 1
Noirtier,--"Pardon, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
say,", 1
added, 1
he,, 1
"but, 1
no, 1
indication, 1
should, 1
be, 1
neglected, 1
in, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
situation., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
see, 1
poor, 1
Barrois, 1
die?", 1
Noirtier, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
of, 1
what, 1
he, 1
died!", 1
asked, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
Noirtier's, 1
shoulder., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
he, 1
died, 1
a, 1
natural, 1
death?", 1
A, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
smile, 1
was, 1
discernible, 1
on, 1
the, 1
motionless, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
Barrois, 1
was, 1
poisoned?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
a, 1
victim, 1
to, 1
was, 1
intended, 1
for, 1
him?", 1
"No.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hand, 1
which, 1
unintentionally, 1
struck, 1
Barrois, 1
has, 1
now, 1
attacked, 1
Valentine?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Then, 1
will, 1
she, 1
die, 1
too?", 1
asked, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
penetrating, 1
gaze, 1
on, 1
Noirtier., 1
He, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
this, 1
question, 1
on, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
he, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
of, 1
triumph, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
puzzled, 1
the, 1
most, 1
clever, 1
diviner., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
hope?", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
with, 1
surprise., 1
"Yes.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
hope?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
made, 1
him, 1
understand, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
true,", 1
murmured, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
Noirtier,--"Do, 1
you, 1
hope, 1
the, 1
assassin, 1
will, 1
be, 1
tried?", 1
"No.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
hope, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
will, 1
take, 1
no, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
Valentine?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
no, 1
news, 1
to, 1
you,", 1
added, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
an, 1
attempt, 1
has, 1
been, 1
made, 1
to, 1
poison, 1
her?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
he, 1
entertained, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
"Then, 1
how, 1
do, 1
you, 1
hope, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
escape?", 1
Noirtier, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
steadfastly, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
spot., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
containing, 1
the, 1
mixture, 1
which, 1
he, 1
took, 1
every, 1
morning., 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sudden, 1
thought,, 1
"has, 1
it, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
you"--Noirtier, 1
did, 1
not, 1
let, 1
him, 1
finish., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"To, 1
prepare, 1
her, 1
system, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
poison?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"By, 1
accustoming, 1
her, 1
by, 1
degrees"--, 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Noirtier,, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
be, 1
understood., 1
"Of, 1
course., 1
I, 1
had, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that, 1
there, 1
was, 1
brucine, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mixture, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you.", 1
"Yes.", 1
"And, 1
by, 1
accustoming, 1
her, 1
to, 1
that, 1
poison,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
neutralize, 1
the, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
poison?", 1
Noirtier's, 1
joy, 1
continued., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
have, 1
succeeded,", 1
exclaimed, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Without, 1
that, 1
precaution, 1
Valentine, 1
would, 1
have, 1
died, 1
before, 1
assistance, 1
could, 1
have, 1
been, 1
procured., 1
The, 1
dose, 1
has, 1
been, 1
excessive,, 1
but, 1
she, 1
has, 1
only, 1
been, 1
shaken, 1
by, 1
it;, 1
and, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
at, 1
any, 1
rate,, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
not, 1
die.", 1
A, 1
superhuman, 1
joy, 1
expanded, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
raised, 1
towards, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
infinite, 1
gratitude., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
Villefort, 1
returned., 1
"Here,, 1
doctor,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"is, 1
what, 1
you, 1
sent, 1
me, 1
for.", 1
"Was, 1
this, 1
prepared, 1
in, 1
your, 1
presence?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
procureur., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
let, 1
it, 1
go, 1
out, 1
of, 1
your, 1
hands?", 1
"No.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
took, 1
the, 1
bottle,, 1
poured, 1
some, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mixture, 1
it, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hollow, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
swallowed, 1
them., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Valentine;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
instructions, 1
to, 1
every, 1
one,, 1
and, 1
you,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
will, 1
yourself, 1
see, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
deviates, 1
from, 1
them.", 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
was, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
Valentine's, 1
room,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
Villefort,, 1
an, 1
Italian, 1
priest,, 1
of, 1
serious, 1
demeanor, 1
and, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
firm, 1
tone,, 1
hired, 1
for, 1
his, 1
use, 1
the, 1
house, 1
adjoining, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
No, 1
one, 1
knew, 1
how, 1
the, 1
three, 1
former, 1
tenants, 1
of, 1
that, 1
house, 1
left, 1
it., 1
About, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
afterwards, 1
its, 1
foundation, 1
was, 1
reported, 1
to, 1
be, 1
unsafe;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
report, 1
did, 1
not, 1
prevent, 1
the, 1
new, 1
occupant, 1
establishing, 1
himself, 1
there, 1
with, 1
his, 1
modest, 1
furniture, 1
the, 1
same, 1
day, 1
at, 1
five, 1
o'clock., 1
The, 1
lease, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
up, 1
for, 1
three,, 1
six,, 1
or, 1
nine, 1
years, 1
by, 1
the, 1
new, 1
tenant,, 1
who,, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rule, 1
of, 1
the, 1
proprietor,, 1
paid, 1
six, 1
months, 1
in, 1
advance., 1
This, 1
new, 1
tenant,, 1
who,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
was, 1
an, 1
Italian,, 1
was, 1
called, 1
Il, 1
Signor, 1
Giacomo, 1
Busoni., 1
Workmen, 1
were, 1
immediately, 1
called, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
same, 1
night, 1
the, 1
passengers, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
faubourg, 1
saw, 1
with, 1
surprise, 1
that, 1
carpenters, 1
and, 1
masons, 1
were, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
repairing, 1
the, 1
lower, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tottering, 1
house., 1
Chapter, 1
95., 1
Father, 1
and, 1
Daughter., 1
We, 1
saw, 1
in, 1
a, 1
preceding, 1
chapter, 1
how, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
went, 1
formally, 1
to, 1
announce, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
the, 1
approaching, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
Eugenie, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
This, 1
announcement,, 1
which, 1
implied, 1
or, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
imply,, 1
the, 1
approval, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
persons, 1
concerned, 1
in, 1
this, 1
momentous, 1
affair,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
to, 1
which, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
must, 1
be, 1
admitted., 1
We, 1
beg, 1
them, 1
to, 1
take, 1
one, 1
step, 1
backward,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
transport, 1
themselves,, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
of, 1
that, 1
day, 1
of, 1
great, 1
catastrophes,, 1
into, 1
the, 1
showy,, 1
gilded, 1
salon, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
shown, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
pride, 1
of, 1
its, 1
owner,, 1
Baron, 1
Danglars., 1
In, 1
this, 1
room,, 1
at, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
been, 1
walking, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro, 1
for, 1
some, 1
minutes, 1
thoughtfully, 1
and, 1
in, 1
evident, 1
uneasiness,, 1
watching, 1
both, 1
doors,, 1
and, 1
listening, 1
to, 1
every, 1
sound., 1
When, 1
his, 1
patience, 1
was, 1
exhausted,, 1
he, 1
called, 1
his, 1
valet., 1
"Etienne,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"see, 1
why, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
has, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
why, 1
she, 1
makes, 1
me, 1
wait, 1
so, 1
long.", 1
Having, 1
given, 1
this, 1
vent, 1
to, 1
his, 1
ill-humor,, 1
the, 1
baron, 1
became, 1
more, 1
calm;, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
that, 1
morning, 1
requested, 1
an, 1
interview, 1
with, 1
her, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gilded, 1
drawing-room, 1
as, 1
the, 1
spot., 1
The, 1
singularity, 1
of, 1
this, 1
step,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
all, 1
its, 1
formality,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
a, 1
little, 1
surprised, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
immediately, 1
obeyed, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
by, 1
repairing, 1
first, 1
to, 1
the, 1
drawing-room., 1
Etienne, 1
soon, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
his, 1
errand., 1
"Mademoiselle's, 1
lady's, 1
maid, 1
says,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
mademoiselle, 1
is, 1
finishing, 1
her, 1
toilette,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
be, 1
here, 1
shortly.", 1
Danglars, 1
nodded,, 1
to, 1
signify, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
satisfied., 1
To, 1
the, 1
world, 1
and, 1
to, 1
his, 1
servants, 1
Danglars, 1
assumed, 1
the, 1
character, 1
of, 1
the, 1
good-natured, 1
man, 1
and, 1
the, 1
indulgent, 1
father., 1
This, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
parts, 1
in, 1
the, 1
popular, 1
comedy, 1
he, 1
was, 1
performing,--a, 1
make-up, 1
he, 1
had, 1
adopted, 1
and, 1
which, 1
suited, 1
him, 1
about, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
masks, 1
worn, 1
on, 1
the, 1
classic, 1
stage, 1
by, 1
paternal, 1
actors,, 1
who, 1
seen, 1
from, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
were, 1
the, 1
image, 1
of, 1
geniality,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
other, 1
showed, 1
lips, 1
drawn, 1
down, 1
in, 1
chronic, 1
ill-temper., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
in, 1
private, 1
the, 1
genial, 1
side, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
level, 1
of, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
generally, 1
the, 1
indulgent, 1
man, 1
disappeared, 1
to, 1
give, 1
place, 1
to, 1
the, 1
brutal, 1
husband, 1
and, 1
domineering, 1
father., 1
"Why, 1
the, 1
devil, 1
does, 1
that, 1
foolish, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
pretends, 1
to, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
not, 1
come, 1
into, 1
my, 1
study?, 1
and, 1
why, 1
on, 1
earth, 1
does, 1
she, 1
want, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
at, 1
all?", 1
He, 1
was, 1
turning, 1
this, 1
thought, 1
over, 1
in, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
for, 1
the, 1
twentieth, 1
time,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
Eugenie, 1
appeared,, 1
attired, 1
in, 1
a, 1
figured, 1
black, 1
satin, 1
dress,, 1
her, 1
hair, 1
dressed, 1
and, 1
gloves, 1
on,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
she, 1
were, 1
going, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Italian, 1
Opera., 1
"Well,, 1
Eugenie,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you, 1
want, 1
with, 1
me?, 1
and, 1
why, 1
in, 1
this, 1
solemn, 1
drawing-room, 1
when, 1
the, 1
study, 1
is, 1
so, 1
comfortable?", 1
"I, 1
quite, 1
understand, 1
why, 1
you, 1
ask,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
making, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
her, 1
father, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seated,, 1
"and, 1
in, 1
fact, 1
your, 1
two, 1
questions, 1
suggest, 1
fully, 1
the, 1
theme, 1
of, 1
our, 1
conversation., 1
I, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
them, 1
both,, 1
and, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
method,, 1
the, 1
last, 1
first,, 1
because, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
least, 1
difficult., 1
I, 1
have, 1
chosen, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
sir,, 1
as, 1
our, 1
place, 1
of, 1
meeting,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
the, 1
disagreeable, 1
impressions, 1
and, 1
influences, 1
of, 1
a, 1
banker's, 1
study., 1
Those, 1
gilded, 1
cashbooks,, 1
drawers, 1
locked, 1
like, 1
gates, 1
of, 1
fortresses,, 1
heaps, 1
of, 1
bank-bills,, 1
come, 1
from, 1
I, 1
know, 1
not, 1
where,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
quantities, 1
of, 1
letters, 1
from, 1
England,, 1
Holland,, 1
Spain,, 1
India,, 1
China,, 1
and, 1
Peru,, 1
have, 1
generally, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
influence, 1
on, 1
a, 1
father's, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
make, 1
him, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
there, 1
is, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
an, 1
interest, 1
greater, 1
and, 1
more, 1
sacred, 1
than, 1
the, 1
good, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
correspondents., 1
I, 1
have,, 1
therefore,, 1
chosen, 1
this, 1
drawing-room,, 1
where, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
smiling, 1
and, 1
happy, 1
in, 1
their, 1
magnificent, 1
frames,, 1
your, 1
portrait,, 1
mine,, 1
my, 1
mother's,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
sorts, 1
of, 1
rural, 1
landscapes, 1
and, 1
touching, 1
pastorals., 1
I, 1
rely, 1
much, 1
on, 1
external, 1
impressions;, 1
perhaps,, 1
with, 1
regard, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
immaterial,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
should, 1
be, 1
no, 1
artist, 1
if, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
some, 1
fancies.", 1
"Very, 1
well,", 1
replied, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
all, 1
this, 1
preamble, 1
with, 1
imperturbable, 1
coolness,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
understanding, 1
a, 1
word,, 1
since, 1
like, 1
every, 1
man, 1
burdened, 1
with, 1
thoughts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
occupied, 1
with, 1
seeking, 1
the, 1
thread, 1
of, 1
his, 1
own, 1
ideas, 1
in, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
speaker., 1
"There, 1
is,, 1
then,, 1
the, 1
second, 1
point, 1
cleared, 1
up,, 1
or, 1
nearly, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
least, 1
confusion,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
that, 1
masculine, 1
pointedness, 1
which, 1
distinguished, 1
her, 1
gesture, 1
and, 1
her, 1
language;, 1
"and, 1
you, 1
appear, 1
satisfied, 1
with, 1
the, 1
explanation., 1
Now,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
first., 1
You, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
why, 1
I, 1
have, 1
requested, 1
this, 1
interview;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
in, 1
two, 1
words,, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
marry, 1
count, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
Danglars, 1
leaped, 1
from, 1
his, 1
chair, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
arms, 1
towards, 1
heaven., 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed,, 1
sir,", 1
continued, 1
Eugenie,, 1
still, 1
quite, 1
calm;, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
astonished,, 1
I, 1
see;, 1
for, 1
since, 1
this, 1
little, 1
affair, 1
began,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
manifested, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
opposition,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
am, 1
always, 1
sure,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
arrives,, 1
to, 1
oppose, 1
a, 1
determined, 1
and, 1
absolute, 1
will, 1
to, 1
people, 1
who, 1
have, 1
not, 1
consulted, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
things, 1
which, 1
displease, 1
me., 1
However,, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
my, 1
tranquillity,, 1
or, 1
passiveness, 1
as, 1
philosophers, 1
say,, 1
proceeded, 1
from, 1
another, 1
source;, 1
it, 1
proceeded, 1
from, 1
a, 1
wish,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
submissive, 1
and, 1
devoted, 1
daughter", 1
(a, 1
slight, 1
smile, 1
was, 1
observable, 1
on, 1
the, 1
purple, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl),, 1
"to, 1
practice, 1
obedience.", 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
"Well,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
the, 1
very, 1
last, 1
and, 1
now, 1
that, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
has, 1
come,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
in, 1
spite, 1
of, 1
all, 1
my, 1
efforts, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
whose, 1
weak, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
at, 1
first, 1
quite, 1
overwhelmed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
this, 1
pitiless, 1
logic,, 1
marking, 1
evident, 1
premeditation, 1
and, 1
force, 1
of, 1
will,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
your, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
this, 1
refusal,, 1
Eugenie?, 1
what, 1
reason, 1
do, 1
you, 1
assign?", 1
"My, 1
reason?", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
"Well,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
that, 1
the, 1
man, 1
is, 1
more, 1
ugly,, 1
more, 1
foolish,, 1
or, 1
more, 1
disagreeable, 1
than, 1
any, 1
other;, 1
no,, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
may, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
look, 1
at, 1
men's, 1
faces, 1
and, 1
figures, 1
as, 1
a, 1
very, 1
good, 1
specimen, 1
of, 1
his, 1
kind., 1
It, 1
is, 1
not,, 1
either,, 1
that, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
is, 1
less, 1
touched, 1
by, 1
him, 1
than, 1
any, 1
other;, 1
that, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
schoolgirl's, 1
reason,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
consider, 1
quite, 1
beneath, 1
me., 1
I, 1
actually, 1
love, 1
no, 1
one,, 1
sir;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
then, 1
see, 1
why,, 1
without, 1
real, 1
necessity,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
encumber, 1
my, 1
life, 1
with, 1
a, 1
perpetual, 1
companion., 1
Has, 1
not, 1
some, 1
sage, 1
said,, 1
'Nothing, 1
too, 1
much'?, 1
and, 1
another,, 1
'I, 1
carry, 1
all, 1
my, 1
effects, 1
with, 1
me'?, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taught, 1
these, 1
two, 1
aphorisms, 1
in, 1
Latin, 1
and, 1
in, 1
Greek;, 1
one, 1
is,, 1
I, 1
believe,, 1
from, 1
Phaedrus,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
from, 1
Bias., 1
Well,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
father,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shipwreck, 1
of, 1
life--for, 1
life, 1
is, 1
an, 1
eternal, 1
shipwreck, 1
of, 1
our, 1
hopes--I, 1
cast, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
my, 1
useless, 1
encumbrance,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
all,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
remain, 1
with, 1
my, 1
own, 1
will,, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1
live, 1
perfectly, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
consequently, 1
perfectly, 1
free.", 1
"Unhappy, 1
girl,, 1
unhappy, 1
girl!", 1
murmured, 1
Danglars,, 1
turning, 1
pale,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
from, 1
long, 1
experience, 1
the, 1
solidity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
obstacle, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
suddenly, 1
encountered., 1
"Unhappy, 1
girl,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"unhappy, 1
girl,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say,, 1
sir?, 1
No,, 1
indeed;, 1
the, 1
exclamation, 1
appears, 1
quite, 1
theatrical, 1
and, 1
affected., 1
Happy,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
for, 1
what, 1
am, 1
I, 1
in, 1
want, 1
of!, 1
The, 1
world, 1
calls, 1
me, 1
beautiful., 1
It, 1
is, 1
something, 1
to, 1
be, 1
well, 1
received., 1
I, 1
like, 1
a, 1
favorable, 1
reception;, 1
it, 1
expands, 1
the, 1
countenance,, 1
and, 1
those, 1
around, 1
me, 1
do, 1
not, 1
then, 1
appear, 1
so, 1
ugly., 1
I, 1
possess, 1
a, 1
share, 1
of, 1
wit,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
relative, 1
sensibility,, 1
which, 1
enables, 1
me, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
from, 1
life, 1
in, 1
general,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
support, 1
of, 1
mine,, 1
all, 1
I, 1
meet, 1
with, 1
that, 1
is, 1
good,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
monkey, 1
who, 1
cracks, 1
the, 1
nut, 1
to, 1
get, 1
at, 1
its, 1
contents., 1
I, 1
am, 1
rich,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
have, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
first, 1
fortunes, 1
in, 1
France., 1
I, 1
am, 1
your, 1
only, 1
daughter,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
so, 1
exacting, 1
as, 1
the, 1
fathers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Porte, 1
Saint-Martin, 1
and, 1
Gaiete,, 1
who, 1
disinherit, 1
their, 1
daughters, 1
for, 1
not, 1
giving, 1
them, 1
grandchildren., 1
Besides,, 1
the, 1
provident, 1
law, 1
has, 1
deprived, 1
you, 1
of, 1
the, 1
power, 1
to, 1
disinherit, 1
me,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
entirely,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
has, 1
also, 1
of, 1
the, 1
power, 1
to, 1
compel, 1
me, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
Monsieur, 1
This, 1
or, 1
Monsieur, 1
That., 1
And, 1
so--being,, 1
beautiful,, 1
witty,, 1
somewhat, 1
talented,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
comic, 1
operas, 1
say,, 1
and, 1
rich--and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
happiness,, 1
sir--why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
call, 1
me, 1
unhappy?", 1
Danglars,, 1
seeing, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
smiling,, 1
and, 1
proud, 1
even, 1
to, 1
insolence,, 1
could, 1
not, 1
entirely, 1
repress, 1
his, 1
brutal, 1
feelings,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
betrayed, 1
themselves, 1
only, 1
by, 1
an, 1
exclamation., 1
Under, 1
the, 1
fixed, 1
and, 1
inquiring, 1
gaze, 1
levelled, 1
at, 1
him, 1
from, 1
under, 1
those, 1
beautiful, 1
black, 1
eyebrows,, 1
he, 1
prudently, 1
turned, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
calmed, 1
himself, 1
immediately,, 1
daunted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
a, 1
resolute, 1
mind., 1
"Truly,, 1
my, 1
daughter,", 1
replied, 1
he, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
all, 1
you, 1
boast, 1
of, 1
being,, 1
excepting, 1
one, 1
thing;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
too, 1
hastily, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
which,, 1
but, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
to, 1
guess, 1
it.", 1
Eugenie, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Danglars,, 1
much, 1
surprised, 1
that, 1
one, 1
flower, 1
of, 1
her, 1
crown, 1
of, 1
pride,, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
so, 1
superbly, 1
decked, 1
herself,, 1
should, 1
be, 1
disputed., 1
"My, 1
daughter,", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
perfectly, 1
explained, 1
to, 1
me, 1
the, 1
sentiments, 1
which, 1
influence, 1
a, 1
girl, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
determined, 1
she, 1
will, 1
not, 1
marry;, 1
now, 1
it, 1
remains, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
the, 1
motives, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
like, 1

who, 1
has, 1
decided, 1
that, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
shall, 1
marry.", 1
Eugenie, 1
bowed,, 1
not, 1
as, 1
a, 1
submissive, 1
daughter,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
an, 1
adversary, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
a, 1
discussion., 1
"My, 1
daughter,", 1
continued, 1
Danglars,, 1
"when, 1
a, 1
father, 1
asks, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
to, 1
choose, 1
a, 1
husband,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
always, 1
some, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
wishing, 1
her, 1
to, 1
marry., 1
Some, 1
are, 1
affected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mania, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
just, 1
now,, 1
that, 1
of, 1
living, 1
again, 1
in, 1
their, 1
grandchildren., 1
This, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
weakness,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
at, 1
once;, 1
family, 1
joys, 1
have, 1
no, 1
charm, 1
for, 1
me., 1
I, 1
may, 1
acknowledge, 1
this, 1
to, 1
a, 1
daughter, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
know, 1
to, 1
be, 1
philosophical, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
my, 1
indifference,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
to, 1
impute, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me, 1
as, 1
a, 1
crime.", 1
"This, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
the, 1
purpose,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
speak, 1
candidly,, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
admire, 1
candor.", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
can,, 1
when, 1
circumstances, 1
render, 1
it, 1
desirable,, 1
adopt, 1
your, 1
system,, 1
although, 1
it, 1
may, 1
not, 1
be, 1
my, 1
general, 1
practice., 1
I, 1
will, 1
therefore, 1
proceed., 1
I, 1
have, 1
proposed, 1
to, 1
you, 1
to, 1
marry,, 1
not, 1
for, 1
your, 1
sake,, 1
for, 1
indeed, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
of, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
at, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
(you, 1
admire, 1
candor,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
now, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1
I, 1
hope);, 1
but, 1
because, 1
it, 1
suited, 1
me, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
you, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
possible,, 1
on, 1
account, 1
of, 1
certain, 1
commercial, 1
speculations, 1
I, 1
am, 1
desirous, 1
of, 1
entering, 1
into.", 1
Eugenie, 1
became, 1
uneasy., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
just, 1
as, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
must, 1
not, 1
be, 1
angry, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
have, 1
sought, 1
this, 1
disclosure., 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
willingly, 1
enter, 1
into, 1
arithmetical, 1
explanations, 1
with, 1
an, 1
artist, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
fears, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
my, 1
study, 1
lest, 1
she, 1
should, 1
imbibe, 1
disagreeable, 1
or, 1
anti-poetic, 1
impressions, 1
and, 1
sensations., 1
But, 1
in, 1
that, 1
same, 1
banker's, 1
study,, 1
where, 1
you, 1
very, 1
willingly, 1
presented, 1
yourself, 1
yesterday, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
the, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
I, 1
give, 1
you, 1
monthly, 1
for, 1
pocket-money,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
know,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
young, 1
lady,, 1
that, 1
many, 1
things, 1
may, 1
be, 1
learned,, 1
useful, 1
even, 1
to, 1
a, 1
girl, 1
who, 1
will, 1
not, 1
marry., 1
There, 1
one, 1
may, 1
learn,, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
what,, 1
out, 1
of, 1
regard, 1
to, 1
your, 1
nervous, 1
susceptibility,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
inform, 1
you, 1
of, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
namely,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
credit, 1
of, 1
a, 1
banker, 1
is, 1
his, 1
physical, 1
and, 1
moral, 1
life;, 1
that, 1
credit, 1
sustains, 1
him, 1
as, 1
breath, 1
animates, 1
the, 1
body;, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
once, 1
gave, 1
me, 1
a, 1
lecture, 1
on, 1
that, 1
subject,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
never, 1
forgotten., 1
There, 1
we, 1
may, 1
learn, 1
that, 1
as, 1
credit, 1
sinks,, 1
the, 1
body, 1
becomes, 1
a, 1
corpse,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
is, 1
what, 1
must, 1
happen, 1
very, 1
soon, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
who, 1
is, 1
proud, 1
to, 1
own, 1
so, 1
good, 1
a, 1
logician, 1
as, 1
you, 1
for, 1
his, 1
daughter.", 1
But, 1
Eugenie,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
stooping,, 1
drew, 1
herself, 1
up, 1
under, 1
the, 1
blow., 1
"Ruined?", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"Exactly,, 1
my, 1
daughter;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
precisely, 1
what, 1
I, 1
mean,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
almost, 1
digging, 1
his, 1
nails, 1
into, 1
his, 1
breast,, 1
while, 1
he, 1
preserved, 1
on, 1
his, 1
harsh, 1
features, 1
the, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heartless, 1
though, 1
clever, 1
man;, 1
"ruined--yes,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
it.", 1
"Ah!", 1
said, 1
Eugenie., 1
"Yes,, 1
ruined!, 1
Now, 1
it, 1
is, 1
revealed,, 1
this, 1
secret, 1
so, 1
full, 1
of, 1
horror,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
tragic, 1
poet, 1
says., 1

my, 1
daughter,, 1

from, 1
my, 1
lips, 1
how, 1
you, 1
may, 1
alleviate, 1
this, 1
misfortune,, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
it, 1
will, 1
affect, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
bad, 1
physiognomist,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
imagine, 1

me, 1
those, 1

twelve, 1
thousand, 1

with, 1
sour, 1
looks, 1

accompanied, 1
with, 1

with, 1

with, 1
flowers?, 1
And, 1

have, 1
that, 1
ardent, 1

of, 1
independence,, 1

will, 1
be, 1
a, 1

instinct, 1
of, 1
self-preservation?, 1
No,, 1

grieve, 1
not, 1
on, 1

Danglars,, 1
pale, 1
with, 1
anger,, 1

was, 1

at, 1
all, 1
due, 1
to, 1
offended, 1
paternal, 1

Eugenie,, 1
looking, 1
so, 1
earnestly, 1
at, 1
her, 1

it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
effort, 1

it, 1
for, 1
another, 1
purpose,, 1

should, 1

the, 1
banker, 1
persisted, 1
in, 1
calling, 1
prince,--a, 1
fresh, 1
breeze, 1
was, 1
stirring, 1

of, 1
the, 1

gay, 1
as, 1
if, 1

were, 1

He, 1
inquired, 1
after, 1
the, 1

with, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
familiarity,, 1
and, 1
ascending, 1
lightly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
second, 1
story, 1
met, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
The, 1
count, 1
stopped, 1
on, 1

the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Andrea,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
launched,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
he, 1
was, 1
once, 1
launched, 1
nothing, 1
stopped, 1
him., 1
"Ah,, 1
good, 1
morning,, 1

"Ah,, 1

"No,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
imperceptible, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
contempt,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1

man's, 1
society,--"no;, 1

to, 1

small, 1
drawing-room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
floor,, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1

crossing, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
motioned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
to, 1
take, 1
a, 1
seat, 1
also., 1
Andrea, 1
assumed, 1
his, 1
gayest, 1
manner., 1

"Ah,, 1
indeed?", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"What;, 1
is, 1
it, 1
news, 1
to, 1
you?, 1
Has, 1
not, 1

Danglars, 1
informed, 1

the, 1
count;, 1
"I, 1
received, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
from, 1
him, 1
yesterday,, 1

do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
was, 1
mentioned.", 1
"Possibly, 1
my, 1
father-in-law, 1
trusted, 1
to, 1
its, 1
general, 1
notoriety.", 1
"Well,", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
fortunate,, 1

Cavalcanti;, 1

is, 1
a, 1
most, 1
suitable, 1

"Yes,, 1
indeed, 1
she, 1
is,", 1

Cavalcanti,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
very, 1
modest, 1
tone., 1
"Above, 1
all,, 1
she, 1
is, 1
very, 1
rich,--at, 1

I, 1
believe, 1
so,", 1

Cristo., 1
"Very, 1
rich,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think?", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Doubtless;, 1
it, 1
is, 1

M., 1
Danglars, 1
conceals, 1
at, 1

half, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune.", 1
"And, 1
he, 1
acknowledges, 1
fifteen, 1

Andrea, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
sparkling, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
"Without, 1
reckoning,", 1

quite, 1
novel, 1

"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1

know, 1

obtained, 1

it, 1

"Precisely;, 1
it, 1

millions, 1

affair.", 1
"Ten, 1
millions!, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
magnificent!", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
confounded, 1
at, 1
the, 1
metallic, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
these, 1
golden, 1
words., 1
"Without, 1
reckoning,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"that, 1
all, 1
his, 1
fortune, 1
will, 1
come, 1
to, 1
you,, 1

justly, 1

an, 1
only, 1
daughter., 1
Besides,, 1
your, 1
own, 1
fortune,, 1

your, 1

assured, 1
me,, 1
is, 1
almost, 1
equal, 1

But, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
money, 1
matters., 1

have, 1
managed, 1
this, 1
affair, 1
rather, 1
skilfully?", 1
"Not, 1
badly,, 1
by, 1
any, 1
means,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man;, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
born, 1
for, 1
a, 1
diplomatist.", 1
"Well,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
become, 1
a, 1
diplomatist;, 1
diplomacy,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
is, 1
something, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
acquired;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
instinctive., 1
Have, 1
you, 1
lost, 1
your, 1
heart?", 1
"Indeed,, 1
I, 1
fear, 1
it,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
Dorante, 1

to, 1
Alceste, 1

at, 1
the, 1

In, 1
Moliere's, 1
comedy,, 1
Le, 1

"I, 1
suppose, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
Andrea, 1
with, 1
a, 1
triumphant, 1
smile,, 1
"since, 1
I, 1
am, 1
accepted., 1

"No,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,--"no;, 1
it, 1

useless, 1
for, 1

coldly,, 1
who, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
perfidious, 1

understood, 1

This, 1

that, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
restrained, 1
by, 1
a, 1
more, 1
muscular, 1
hand, 1
than, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
restraint, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
easily, 1
broken, 1
through., 1
"Oh,, 1
then, 1
my, 1
father, 1
has, 1
really, 1
a, 1
very, 1
large, 1
fortune,, 1
count?", 1
"It, 1
appears, 1
so,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
if, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
settlement, 1
he, 1
promised, 1
me, 1
has, 1
come?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
advised, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
three, 1
millions?", 1
"The, 1
three, 1
millions, 1
are, 1
probably, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road.", 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
really, 1
have, 1
them?", 1
"Oh,, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
you, 1
have, 1
yet, 1
known, 1
the, 1
want, 1
of, 1
money.", 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
so, 1
surprised, 1
that, 1
he, 1
pondered, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
Then,, 1
arousing, 1
from, 1
his, 1
revery,--"Now,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
one, 1
request, 1
to, 1
make, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
understand,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
it, 1
should, 1
be, 1
disagreeable, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"Proceed,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
formed, 1
an, 1
acquaintance,, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fortune,, 1
with, 1
many, 1
noted, 1
persons,, 1
and, 1
have,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment,, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
friends., 1
But, 1
marrying,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
before, 1
all, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
an, 1
illustrious, 1

in, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paternal, 1
hand, 1

powerful, 1
one, 1

to, 1

me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
altar;, 1
now,, 1
my, 1
father, 1
is, 1
not, 1
coming, 1
to, 1
Paris,, 1
is, 1
he?, 1
He, 1
is, 1
old,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
wounds,, 1
and, 1
suffers, 1
dreadfully,, 1
he, 1
says,, 1
in, 1
travelling.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
come, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
a, 1
favor, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"Of, 1
me?", 1
"Yes,, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"And, 1
pray, 1
what, 1
may, 1
it, 1
be?", 1
"Well,, 1
to, 1
take, 1
his, 1
part.", 1
"Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir!, 1
What?--after, 1
the, 1
varied, 1
relations, 1
I, 1
have, 1
had, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
to, 1
sustain, 1
towards, 1
you,, 1
can, 1
it, 1

that, 1
you, 1
know, 1
me, 1
so, 1
little, 1
as, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
such, 1
a, 1

Ask, 1
me, 1
to, 1
lend, 1
you, 1
half, 1
a, 1
million, 1

although, 1
such, 1
a, 1
loan, 1
is, 1
somewhat, 1
rare,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
honor,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
annoy, 1
me, 1
less!, 1
Know,, 1
then,, 1
what, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
had, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you,, 1
that, 1

participation, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world's, 1
affairs,, 1

especially, 1
in, 1
their, 1
moral, 1
aspects,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
has, 1
never, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
entertain, 1
the, 1
scruples, 1
and, 1
even, 1
the, 1
superstitions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
East., 1
I,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
a, 1
seraglio, 1
at, 1
Cairo,, 1
one, 1
at, 1
Smyrna,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
at, 1
Constantinople,, 1
preside, 1
at, 1
a, 1
wedding?--never!", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
refuse, 1
me?", 1
"Decidedly;, 1
and, 1
were, 1
you, 1
my, 1
son, 1
or, 1
my, 1
brother, 1
I, 1
would, 1
refuse, 1
you, 1
in, 1
the, 1

way.", 1
"But, 1
what, 1
must, 1
be, 1
done?", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
disappointed., 1
"You, 1
said, 1
just, 1
now, 1
that, 1
you, 1
had, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
friends.", 1
"Very, 1
true,, 1

you, 1
introduced, 1
me, 1
at, 1
M., 1
Danglars'.", 1
"Not, 1
at, 1
all!, 1
Let, 1
us, 1
recall, 1
the, 1
exact, 1
facts., 1
You, 1
met, 1
him, 1
at, 1
a, 1
dinner, 1
party, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
introduced, 1
yourself, 1
at, 1
his, 1
house;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
a, 1
totally, 1
different, 1
affair.", 1
"Yes,, 1
but,, 1
by, 1
my, 1
marriage,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
forwarded, 1
that.", 1
"I?--not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least,, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
you, 1
to, 1
believe., 1
Recollect, 1
what, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
when, 1
you, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
to, 1
propose, 1
you., 1
'Oh,, 1
I, 1
never, 1
make, 1
matches,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
prince,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
my, 1
settled, 1
principle.'", 1
Andrea, 1
bit, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
"But,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
there?", 1
"Will, 1
all, 1
Paris, 1
be, 1
there?", 1
"Oh,, 1
certainly.", 1
"Well,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
there, 1
too,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"And, 1
will, 1
you, 1
sign, 1
the, 1
contract?", 1
"I, 1
see, 1
no, 1
objection, 1
to, 1
that;, 1
my, 1
scruples, 1
do, 1
not, 1
go, 1
thus, 1
far.", 1
"Well,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
will, 1
grant, 1
me, 1
no, 1
more,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
content, 1
with, 1
what, 1
you, 1
give, 1
me., 1
But, 1
one, 1
word, 1
more,, 1
count.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"Advice.", 1
"Be, 1
careful;, 1
advice, 1
is, 1
worse, 1
than, 1
a, 1
service.", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
give, 1
me, 1
this, 1
without, 1
compromising, 1
yourself.", 1
"Tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
"Is, 1
my, 1
wife's, 1
fortune, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
livres?", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
himself, 1
announced.", 1
"Must, 1
I, 1
receive, 1
it,, 1
or, 1
leave, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
notary?", 1
"This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
way, 1
such, 1
affairs, 1
are, 1
generally, 1
arranged, 1
when, 1
it, 1
is, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
do, 1
them, 1
stylishly:, 1
Your, 1
two, 1
solicitors, 1
appoint, 1
a, 1
meeting,, 1

the, 1
contract, 1
is, 1
signed,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
or, 1
the, 1
following, 1
day;, 1
then, 1
they, 1
exchange, 1
the, 1
two, 1
portions,, 1
for, 1
which, 1
they, 1
each, 1
give, 1
a, 1
receipt;, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
is, 1
celebrated,, 1

amount, 1
at, 1
your, 1
disposal, 1
as, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
alliance.", 1
"Because,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
ill-concealed, 1
uneasiness,, 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
heard, 1
my, 1
father-in-law, 1
say, 1
that, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
embarking, 1
our, 1
property, 1
in, 1
that, 1
famous, 1
railway, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
just, 1
now.", 1
"Well,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
way,, 1
everybody, 1
says,, 1
of, 1
trebling, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
in, 1
twelve, 1
months., 1
Baron, 1
Danglars, 1
is, 1
a, 1
good, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
knows, 1
how, 1
to, 1
calculate.", 1
"In, 1
that, 1
case,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"everything, 1
is, 1
all, 1
right,, 1
excepting, 1
your, 1
refusal,, 1
which, 1
quite, 1
grieves, 1
me.", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
attribute, 1
it, 1
only, 1
to, 1
natural, 1
scruples, 1
under, 1
similar, 1
circumstances.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"let, 1
it, 1
be, 1
as, 1
you, 1
wish., 1
This, 1
evening,, 1
then,, 1
at, 1
nine, 1
o'clock.", 1
"Adieu, 1
till, 1
then.", 1
Notwithstanding, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
resistance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
whose, 1
lips, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
preserved, 1
his, 1
ceremonious, 1
smile,, 1
Andrea, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand,, 1
pressed, 1
it,, 1
jumped, 1
into, 1
his, 1
phaeton,, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
remaining, 1
hours, 1
before, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
arrived,, 1
Andrea, 1
employed, 1
in, 1
riding,, 1
paying, 1
visits,--designed, 1
to, 1
induce, 1
those, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
at, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
in, 1
their, 1
gayest, 1
equipages,--dazzling, 1
them, 1
by, 1
promises, 1
of, 1
shares, 1
in, 1
schemes, 1
which, 1
have, 1
since, 1
turned, 1
every, 1
brain,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
just, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
initiative., 1
In, 1
fact,, 1
at, 1
half-past, 1
eight, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
salon,, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
adjoining,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
three, 1
other, 1
drawing-rooms, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
floor,, 1
were, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
a, 1
perfumed, 1
crowd,, 1
who, 1
sympathized, 1
but, 1
little, 1
in, 1
the, 1
event,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
all, 1
participated, 1
in, 1
that, 1
love, 1
of, 1
being, 1
present, 1
wherever, 1
there, 1
is, 1
anything, 1
fresh, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen., 1
An, 1
Academician, 1
would, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
entertainments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fashionable, 1
world, 1
are, 1
collections, 1
of, 1
flowers, 1
which, 1
attract, 1
inconstant, 1
butterflies,, 1
famished, 1
bees,, 1
and, 1
buzzing, 1
drones., 1
No, 1
one, 1
could, 1
deny, 1
that, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
were, 1
splendidly, 1
illuminated;, 1
the, 1
light, 1
streamed, 1
forth, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gilt, 1
mouldings, 1
and, 1
the, 1
silk, 1
hangings;, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
bad, 1
taste, 1
of, 1
decorations,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
only, 1
their, 1
richness, 1
to, 1
boast, 1
of,, 1
shone, 1
in, 1
its, 1
splendor., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
elegant, 1
simplicity, 1
in, 1
a, 1
figured, 1
white, 1
silk, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
white, 1
rose, 1
half, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
her, 1
jet, 1
black, 1
hair, 1
was, 1
her, 1
only, 1
ornament,, 1
unaccompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
single, 1
jewel., 1
Her, 1
eyes,, 1
however,, 1
betrayed, 1
that, 1
perfect, 1
confidence, 1
which, 1
contradicted, 1
the, 1
girlish, 1
simplicity, 1
of, 1
this, 1
modest, 1
attire., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
chatting, 1
at, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance, 1
with, 1
Debray,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
admitted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house, 1
for, 1
this, 1
grand, 1
ceremony,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
plane, 1
with, 1
every, 1
one, 1
else,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
any, 1
particular, 1
privilege., 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
deputies, 1
and, 1
men, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
revenue,, 1
was, 1
explaining, 1
a, 1
new, 1
theory, 1
of, 1
taxation, 1
which, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
adopt, 1
when, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
events, 1
had, 1
compelled, 1
the, 1
government, 1
to, 1
call, 1
him, 1
into, 1
the, 1
ministry., 1
Andrea,, 1
on, 1
whose, 1
arm, 1
hung, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
consummate, 1
dandies, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opera,, 1
was, 1
explaining, 1
to, 1
him, 1
rather, 1
cleverly,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
be, 1
bold, 1
to, 1
appear, 1
at, 1
ease,, 1
his, 1
future, 1
projects,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
new, 1
luxuries, 1
he, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
introduce, 1
to, 1
Parisian, 1
fashions, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
seventy-five, 1
thousand, 1
livres, 1
per, 1
annum., 1
The, 1
crowd, 1
moved, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro, 1
in, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
like, 1
an, 1
ebb, 1
and, 1
flow, 1
of, 1
turquoises,, 1
rubies,, 1
emeralds,, 1
opals,, 1
and, 1
diamonds., 1
As, 1
usual,, 1
the, 1
oldest, 1
women, 1
were, 1
the, 1
most, 1
decorated,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ugliest, 1
the, 1
most, 1
conspicuous., 1
If, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
lily,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
rose,, 1
you, 1
had, 1
to, 1
search, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
some, 1
corner, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
mother, 1
with, 1
a, 1
turban,, 1
or, 1
an, 1
aunt, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bird, 1
of, 1
paradise., 1
At, 1
each, 1
moment,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
the, 1
buzzing,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
laughter,, 1
the, 1
door-keeper's, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
announcing, 1
some, 1
name, 1
well, 1
known, 1
in, 1
the, 1
financial, 1
department,, 1
respected, 1
in, 1
the, 1
army,, 1
or, 1
illustrious, 1
in, 1
the, 1
literary, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
acknowledged, 1
by, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
movement, 1
in, 1
the, 1
different, 1
groups., 1
But, 1
for, 1
one, 1
whose, 1
privilege, 1
it, 1
was, 1
to, 1
agitate, 1
that, 1
ocean, 1
of, 1
human, 1
waves,, 1
how, 1
many, 1
were, 1
received, 1
with, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
indifference, 1
or, 1
a, 1
sneer, 1
of, 1
disdain!, 1
At, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
massive, 1
time-piece,, 1
representing, 1
Endymion, 1

the, 1
faithful, 1
type, 1
of, 1

nine, 1
times,, 1
the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
resounded, 1
in, 1
its, 1
turn,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
if, 1
by, 1
an, 1
electric, 1
shock, 1
all, 1
the, 1
assembly, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black, 1
and, 1
with, 1
his, 1
habitual, 1
simplicity;, 1
his, 1
white, 1
waistcoat, 1
displayed, 1
his, 1
expansive, 1
noble, 1
chest, 1
and, 1
his, 1
black, 1
stock, 1
was, 1
singularly, 1
noticeable, 1
because, 1
of, 1
its, 1
contrast, 1
with, 1
the, 1
deadly, 1
paleness, 1
of, 1
his, 1
face., 1
His, 1
only, 1
jewellery, 1
was, 1
a, 1
chain,, 1
so, 1
fine, 1
that, 1
the, 1
slender, 1
gold, 1
thread, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
perceptible, 1
on, 1
his, 1
white, 1
waistcoat., 1
A, 1
circle, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
formed, 1
around, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
count, 1
perceived, 1
at, 1
one, 1
glance, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
at, 1
one, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
at, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
Eugenie, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
him., 1
He, 1
first, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
chatting, 1
with, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
come, 1
alone,, 1
Valentine, 1
being, 1
still, 1
an, 1
invalid;, 1
and, 1
without, 1
turning, 1
aside,, 1
so, 1
clear, 1
was, 1
the, 1
road, 1
left, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
to, 1
Eugenie,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
complimented, 1
in, 1
such, 1
rapid, 1
and, 1
measured, 1
terms,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
proud, 1
artist, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
struck., 1
Near, 1
her, 1
was, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
who, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
for, 1
the, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
introduction, 1
he, 1
had, 1
so, 1
kindly, 1
given, 1
her, 1
for, 1
Italy,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
intended, 1
immediately, 1
to, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of., 1
On, 1
leaving, 1
these, 1
ladies, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
Having, 1
accomplished, 1
these, 1
three, 1
social, 1
duties,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
stopped,, 1
looking, 1
around, 1
him, 1
with, 1
that, 1
expression, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
class,, 1
which, 1
seems, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
done, 1
my, 1
duty,, 1
now, 1
let, 1
others, 1
do, 1
theirs.", 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
in, 1
an, 1
adjoining, 1
room,, 1
had, 1
shared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
caused, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
and, 1
now, 1
came, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
his, 1
respects, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count., 1
He, 1
found, 1
him, 1
completely, 1
surrounded;, 1
all, 1
were, 1
eager, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
always, 1
the, 1
case, 1
with, 1
those, 1
whose, 1
words, 1
are, 1
few, 1
and, 1
weighty., 1
The, 1
solicitors, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
and, 1
arranged, 1
their, 1
scrawled, 1
papers, 1
on, 1
the, 1
velvet, 1
cloth, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
gold, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
table, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
the, 1
signature;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
gilt, 1
table, 1
supported, 1
on, 1
lions', 1
claws., 1
One, 1
of, 1
the, 1
notaries, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
remained, 1
standing., 1
They, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
proceed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reading, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contract,, 1
which, 1
half, 1
Paris, 1
assembled, 1
was, 1
to, 1
sign., 1
All, 1
took, 1
their, 1
places,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
circle,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
gentlemen, 1
(more, 1
indifferent, 1
to, 1
the, 1
restraints, 1
of, 1
what, 1
Boileau, 1
calls, 1
the, 1
"energetic, 1
style"), 1
commented, 1
on, 1
the, 1
feverish, 1
agitation, 1
of, 1
Andrea,, 1
on, 1
M., 1
Danglars', 1
riveted, 1
attention,, 1
Eugenie's, 1
composure,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
light, 1
and, 1
sprightly, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
treated, 1
this, 1
important, 1
affair., 1
The, 1
contract, 1
was, 1
read, 1
during, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
silence., 1
But, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
finished,, 1
the, 1
buzz, 1
was, 1
redoubled, 1
through, 1
all, 1
the, 1
drawing-rooms;, 1
the, 1
brilliant, 1
sums,, 1
the, 1
rolling, 1
millions, 1
which, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
at, 1
the, 1
command, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
people,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
crowned, 1
the, 1
display, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wedding, 1
presents, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
lady's, 1
diamonds,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
in, 1
a, 1
room, 1
entirely, 1
appropriated, 1
for, 1
that, 1
purpose,, 1
had, 1
exercised, 1
to, 1
the, 1
full, 1
their, 1
delusions, 1
over, 1
the, 1
envious, 1
assembly., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars', 1
charms, 1
were, 1
heightened, 1
in, 1
the, 1
opinion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
outvie, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
in, 1
splendor., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
ladies,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
needless, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
while, 1
they, 1
coveted, 1
the, 1
millions,, 1
they, 1
thought, 1
they, 1
did, 1
not, 1
need, 1
them, 1
for, 1
themselves,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
were, 1
beautiful, 1
enough, 1
without, 1
them., 1
Andrea,, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
his, 1
friends,, 1
complimented,, 1
flattered,, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
in, 1
the, 1
reality, 1
of, 1
his, 1
dream,, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
bewildered., 1
The, 1
notary, 1
solemnly, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pen,, 1
flourished, 1
it, 1
above, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"Gentlemen,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
about, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
the, 1
contract.", 1
The, 1
baron, 1
was, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
first,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
representative, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
senior,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
"future, 1
couple,", 1
as, 1
they, 1
are, 1
styled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
abominable, 1
phraseology, 1
of, 1
legal, 1
documents., 1
The, 1
baron, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
and, 1
signed,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
representative., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
approached,, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
arm., 1
"My, 1
dear,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
as, 1
she, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pen,, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
vexatious?, 1
An, 1
unexpected, 1
incident,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
of, 1
murder, 1
and, 1
theft, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
nearly, 1
fell, 1
a, 1
victim,, 1
deprives, 1
us, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1
seeing, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort.", 1
"Indeed?", 1
said, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
said,, 1
"Oh,, 1
well,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
I, 1
care?", 1
"As, 1
a, 1
matter, 1
of, 1
fact,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
approaching,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
much, 1
afraid, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
involuntary, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
his, 1
absence.", 1
"What,, 1
you,, 1
count?", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
signing;, 1
"if, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
take, 1
care,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
never, 1
forgive, 1
you.", 1
Andrea, 1
pricked, 1
up, 1
his, 1
ears., 1
"But, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
my, 1
fault,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
prove.", 1
Every, 1
one, 1
listened, 1
eagerly;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
who, 1
so, 1
rarely, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
speak., 1
"You, 1
remember,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
during, 1
the, 1
most, 1
profound, 1
silence,, 1
"that, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
wretch, 1
who, 1
came, 1
to, 1
rob, 1
me, 1
died, 1
at, 1
my, 1
house;, 1
the, 1
supposition, 1
is, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
stabbed, 1
by, 1
his, 1
accomplice,, 1
on, 1
attempting, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
it.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
"In, 1
order, 1
that, 1
his, 1
wounds, 1
might, 1
be, 1
examined, 1
he, 1
was, 1
undressed,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
clothes, 1
were, 1
thrown, 1
into, 1
a, 1
corner,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
police, 1
picked, 1
them, 1
up,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waistcoat,, 1
which, 1
they, 1
overlooked.", 1
Andrea, 1
turned, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
cloud, 1
rising, 1
in, 1
the, 1
horizon,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
forebode, 1
a, 1
coming, 1
storm., 1
"Well,, 1
this, 1
waistcoat, 1
was, 1
discovered, 1
to-day,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
blood,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hole, 1
over, 1
the, 1
heart.", 1
The, 1
ladies, 1
screamed,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
faint., 1
"It, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
to, 1
me., 1
No, 1
one, 1
could, 1
guess, 1
what, 1
the, 1
dirty, 1
rag, 1
could, 1
be;, 1
I, 1
alone, 1
suspected, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
waistcoat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
murdered, 1
man., 1
My, 1
valet,, 1
in, 1
examining, 1
this, 1
mournful, 1
relic,, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
paper, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pocket, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
it, 1
out;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
baron.", 1
"To, 1
me?", 1
cried, 1
Danglars., 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed,, 1
to, 1
you;, 1
I, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
deciphering, 1
your, 1
name, 1
under, 1
the, 1
blood, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
was, 1
stained,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
general, 1
outburst, 1
of, 1
amazement., 1
"But,", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
with, 1
uneasiness,, 1
"how, 1
could, 1
that, 1
prevent, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort"--, 1
"In, 1
this, 1
simple, 1
way,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"the, 1
waistcoat, 1
and, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
were, 1
both, 1
what, 1
is, 1
termed, 1
circumstantial, 1
evidence;, 1
I, 1
therefore, 1
sent, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney., 1
You, 1
understand,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
baron,, 1
that, 1
legal, 1
methods, 1
are, 1
the, 1
safest, 1
in, 1
criminal, 1
cases;, 1
it, 1
was,, 1
perhaps,, 1
some, 1
plot, 1
against, 1
you.", 1
Andrea, 1
looked, 1
steadily, 1
at, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
and, 1
disappeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
second, 1
drawing-room., 1
"Possibly,", 1
said, 1
Danglars;, 1
"was, 1
not, 1
this, 1
murdered, 1
man, 1
an, 1
old, 1
galley-slave?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"a, 1
felon, 1
named, 1
Caderousse.", 1
Danglars, 1
turned, 1
slightly, 1
pale;, 1
Andrea, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
anteroom, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
little, 1
drawing-room., 1
"But, 1
go, 1
on, 1
signing,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
perceive, 1
that, 1
my, 1
story, 1
has, 1
caused, 1
a, 1
general, 1
emotion,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
to, 1
apologize, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
baroness,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars.", 1
The, 1
baroness,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
signed,, 1
returned, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
to, 1
the, 1
notary., 1
"Prince, 1
Cavalcanti,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
latter;, 1
"Prince, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
where, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
"Andrea,, 1
Andrea,", 1
repeated, 1
several, 1
young, 1
people,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
already, 1
on, 1
sufficiently, 1
intimate, 1
terms, 1
with, 1
him, 1
to, 1
call, 1
him, 1
by, 1
his, 1
Christian, 1
name., 1
"Call, 1
the, 1
prince;, 1
inform, 1
him, 1
that, 1
it, 1
is, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
sign,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
floorkeepers., 1
But, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
guests, 1
rushed, 1
in, 1
alarm, 1
into, 1
the, 1
principal, 1
salon, 1
as, 1
if, 1
some, 1
frightful, 1
monster, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
apartments,, 1
quaerens, 1
quem, 1
devoret., 1
There, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
retreat,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
scream., 1
An, 1
officer, 1
was, 1
placing, 1
two, 1
soldiers, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
each, 1
drawing-room,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
Danglars,, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
commissary, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
girded, 1
with, 1
his, 1
scarf., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
scream, 1
and, 1
fainted., 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
thought, 1
himself, 1
threatened, 1
(certain, 1
consciences, 1
are, 1
never, 1
calm),--Danglars, 1
even, 1
before, 1
his, 1
guests, 1
showed, 1
a, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
abject, 1
terror., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
advancing, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
commissioner., 1
"Which, 1
of, 1
you, 1
gentlemen,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
without, 1
replying, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"answers, 1
to, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
A, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
astonishment, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
from, 1
all, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
They, 1
searched;, 1
they, 1
questioned., 1
"But, 1
who, 1
then, 1
is, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars, 1
in, 1
amazement., 1
"A, 1
galley-slave,, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
confinement, 1
at, 1
Toulon.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
crime, 1
has, 1
he, 1
committed?", 1
"He, 1
is, 1
accused,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
commissary, 1
with, 1
his, 1
inflexible, 1
voice,, 1
"of, 1
having, 1
assassinated, 1
the, 1
man, 1
named, 1

of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1

Monte, 1

cast, 1
a, 1
rapid, 1
glance, 1
around, 1
him., 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
gone., 1
Chapter, 1
97., 1
The, 1
Departure, 1
for, 1
Belgium., 1
A, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
confusion, 1
produced, 1
in, 1
the, 1
salons, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
by, 1
the, 1
unexpected, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brigade, 1
of, 1
soldiers,, 1
and, 1
by, 1
the, 1
disclosure, 1
which, 1
had, 1
followed,, 1
the, 1
mansion, 1
was, 1
deserted, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
rapidity, 1
as, 1
if, 1
a, 1
case, 1
of, 1
plague, 1
or, 1
of, 1
cholera, 1
morbus, 1
had, 1
broken, 1
out, 1
among, 1
the, 1
guests., 1
In, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes,, 1
through, 1
all, 1
the, 1
doors,, 1
down, 1
all, 1
the, 1
staircases,, 1
by, 1
every, 1
exit,, 1
every, 1
one, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
retire,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
to, 1
fly;, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
situation, 1
where, 1
the, 1
ordinary, 1
condolences,--which, 1
even, 1
the, 1
best, 1
friends, 1
are, 1
so, 1
eager, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
in, 1
great, 1
catastrophes,--were, 1
seen, 1
to, 1
be, 1
utterly, 1
futile., 1
There, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
house, 1
only, 1
Danglars,, 1
closeted, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
and, 1
making, 1
his, 1
statement, 1
to, 1
the, 1
officer, 1
of, 1
gendarmes;, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
terrified,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
boudoir, 1
with, 1
which, 1
we, 1
are, 1
acquainted;, 1
and, 1
Eugenie,, 1
who, 1
with, 1
haughty, 1
air, 1
and, 1
disdainful, 1
lip, 1
had, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
her, 1
room, 1
with, 1
her, 1
inseparable, 1
companion,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
numerous, 1

evening, 1
than, 1
usual,, 1

number, 1
was, 1
augmented, 1
by, 1
cooks, 1
and, 1
butlers, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1

venting, 1
on, 1
their, 1
employers, 1
their, 1
anger, 1
at, 1
what, 1
they, 1
termed, 1
the, 1
insult, 1
to, 1

in, 1
the, 1
hall,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
kitchens,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
their, 1
rooms,, 1
thinking, 1
very, 1
little, 1
of, 1
their, 1
duty,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
naturally, 1
interrupted., 1
Of, 1
all, 1
this, 1
household,, 1
only, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
deserve, 1
our, 1
notice;, 1
these, 1
are, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Louise, 1
d'Armilly., 1
The, 1
betrothed, 1
had, 1
retired,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
haughty, 1
air,, 1
disdainful, 1
lip,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
demeanor, 1
of, 1
an, 1
outraged, 1
queen,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
her, 1
companion,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
paler, 1
and, 1
more, 1
disturbed, 1
than, 1
herself., 1
On, 1
reaching, 1
her, 1
room, 1
Eugenie, 1
locked, 1
her, 1
door,, 1
while, 1
Louise, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair., 1
"Ah,, 1
what, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
thing,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
musician;, 1
"who, 1
would, 1
have, 1
suspected, 1
it?, 1
M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
a, 1
murderer--a, 1
galley-slave, 1
escaped--a, 1
convict!", 1
An, 1
ironical, 1
smile, 1
curled, 1
the, 1
lip, 1
of, 1
Eugenie., 1
"In, 1
truth, 1
I, 1
was, 1
fated,", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"I, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
Morcerf, 1
only, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti.", 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
confound, 1
the, 1
two,, 1
Eugenie.", 1
"Hold, 1
your, 1
tongue!, 1
The, 1
men, 1
are, 1
all, 1
infamous,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
happy, 1
to, 1
be, 1
able, 1
now, 1
to, 1
do, 1
more, 1
than, 1
detest, 1
them--I, 1
despise, 1
them.", 1
"What, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
do?", 1
asked, 1
Louise., 1
"What, 1
shall, 1
we, 1
do?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Why,, 1
the, 1
same, 1
we, 1
had, 1
intended, 1
doing, 1
three, 1
days, 1
since--set, 1
off.", 1
"What?--although, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
now, 1
going, 1
to, 1
be, 1
married,, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
still"--, 1
"Listen,, 1
Louise., 1
I, 1
hate, 1
this, 1
life, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fashionable, 1
world,, 1
always, 1
ordered,, 1
measured,, 1
ruled,, 1
like, 1
our, 1
music-paper., 1
What, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
wished, 1
for,, 1
desired,, 1
and, 1
coveted,, 1
is, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
an, 1
artist,, 1
free, 1
and, 1
independent,, 1
relying, 1
only, 1
on, 1
my, 1
own, 1
resources,, 1
and, 1
accountable, 1
only, 1
to, 1
myself., 1
Remain, 1
here?, 1
What, 1
for?--that, 1
they, 1
may, 1
try,, 1
a, 1
month, 1
hence,, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
me, 1
again;, 1
and, 1
to, 1
whom?--M., 1
Debray,, 1
perhaps,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
once, 1
proposed., 1
No,, 1
Louise,, 1
no!, 1
This, 1
evening's, 1
adventure, 1
will, 1
serve, 1
for, 1
my, 1
excuse., 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
one,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
one., 1
God, 1
sends, 1
me, 1
this,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
hail, 1
it, 1
joyfully!", 1
"How, 1
strong, 1
and, 1
courageous, 1
you, 1
are!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
fair,, 1
frail, 1
girl, 1
to, 1
her, 1
brunette, 1
companion., 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
know, 1
me?, 1
Come,, 1
Louise,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
our, 1
affairs., 1
The, 1
post-chaise"--, 1
"Was, 1
happily, 1
bought, 1
three, 1
days, 1
since.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
had, 1
it, 1
sent, 1
where, 1
we, 1
are, 1
to, 1
go, 1
for, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Our, 1
passport?", 1
"Here, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
And, 1
Eugenie,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
precision,, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
printed, 1
paper,, 1
and, 1
read,--, 1
"M., 1
Leon, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age;, 1
profession,, 1
artist;, 1
hair, 1
black,, 1
eyes, 1
black;, 1
travelling, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sister.", 1
"Capital!, 1
How, 1
did, 1
you, 1
get, 1
this, 1
passport?", 1
"When, 1
I, 1
went, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
for, 1
letters, 1
to, 1
the, 1
directors, 1
of, 1
the, 1
theatres, 1
at, 1
Rome, 1
and, 1
Naples,, 1
I, 1
expressed, 1
my, 1
fears, 1
of, 1
travelling, 1
as, 1
a, 1
woman;, 1
he, 1
perfectly, 1
understood, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
undertook, 1
to, 1
procure, 1
for, 1
me, 1
a, 1
man's, 1
passport,, 1
and, 1
two, 1
days, 1
after, 1
I, 1
received, 1
this,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
added, 1
with, 1
my, 1
own, 1
hand,, 1
'travelling, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sister.'", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie, 1
cheerfully,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
then, 1
only, 1
to, 1
pack, 1
up, 1
our, 1
trunks;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
start, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1

contract,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1

evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wedding--that, 1
is, 1
all.", 1
"But, 1
consider, 1
the, 1
matter, 1
seriously,, 1
Eugenie!", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
done, 1
with, 1
considering!, 1
I, 1
am, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
only, 1
of, 1
market, 1
reports,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1

of, 1
the, 1
rise, 1
and, 1
fall, 1
of, 1
Spanish, 1
funds,, 1
of, 1

Instead, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
Louise--do, 1
you, 1
understand?--air,, 1
liberty,, 1
melody, 1
of, 1
birds,, 1
plains, 1
of, 1
Lombardy,, 1
Venetian, 1
canals,, 1
Roman, 1
palaces,, 1
the, 1
Bay, 1
of, 1
Naples., 1
How, 1
much, 1
have, 1
we,, 1
Louise?", 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
this, 1
question, 1
was, 1
addressed, 1
drew, 1
from, 1
an, 1
inlaid, 1
secretary, 1
a, 1
small, 1
portfolio, 1
with, 1
a, 1
lock,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
counted, 1
twenty-three, 1
bank-notes., 1
"Twenty-three, 1
thousand, 1
francs,", 1
said, 1
she., 1
"And, 1
as, 1
much,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
in, 1
pearls,, 1
diamonds,, 1
and, 1
jewels,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie., 1
"We, 1
are, 1
rich., 1
With, 1
forty-five, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
we, 1
can, 1
live, 1
like, 1
princesses, 1
for, 1
two, 1
years,, 1
and, 1
comfortably, 1
for, 1
four;, 1
but, 1
before, 1
six, 1
months--you, 1
with, 1
your, 1
music,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
with, 1
my, 1
voice--we, 1
shall, 1
double, 1
our, 1
capital., 1
Come,, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
take, 1
charge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
money,, 1

of, 1
the, 1
jewel-box;, 1
so, 1
that, 1

one, 1
of, 1
us, 1
had, 1
the, 1
misfortune, 1
to, 1
lose, 1
her, 1
treasure,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
would, 1
still, 1
have, 1
hers, 1
left., 1
Now,, 1
the, 1
portmanteau--let, 1
us, 1
make, 1
haste--the, 1
portmanteau!", 1
"Stop!", 1
said, 1
Louise,, 1
going, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
door., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
fear?", 1
"That, 1
we, 1
may, 1
be, 1
discovered.", 1
"The, 1
door, 1
is, 1
locked.", 1
"They, 1
may, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
to, 1
open, 1
it.", 1
"They, 1
may, 1
if, 1
they, 1
like,, 1
but, 1
we, 1
will, 1
not.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
a, 1
perfect, 1
Amazon,, 1
Eugenie!", 1
And, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
girls, 1
began, 1
to, 1
heap, 1
into, 1
a, 1
trunk, 1
all, 1
the, 1
things, 1
they, 1
thought, 1
they, 1
should, 1
require., 1
"There, 1
now,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"while, 1
I, 1
change, 1
my, 1
costume, 1
do, 1
you, 1
lock, 1
the, 1
portmanteau.", 1
Louise, 1
pressed, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
her, 1
little, 1
hands, 1
on, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
portmanteau., 1
"But, 1
I, 1
cannot,", 1
said, 1
she;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
strong, 1
enough;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
shut, 1
it.", 1
"Ah,, 1
you, 1
do, 1
well, 1
to, 1
ask,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
laughing;, 1
"I, 1
forgot, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
Hercules,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
only, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
Omphale!", 1
And, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
kneeling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
top,, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
two, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
portmanteau, 1
together,, 1
and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
bolt, 1
of, 1
the, 1
padlock, 1
through., 1
When, 1
this, 1
was, 1
done,, 1
Eugenie, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
drawer,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
she, 1
kept, 1
the, 1
key,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
from, 1
it, 1
a, 1
wadded, 1
violet, 1
silk, 1
travelling, 1
cloak., 1
"Here,", 1
said, 1
she,, 1
"you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
everything;, 1
with, 1
this, 1
cloak, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
cold.", 1
"But, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
never, 1
cold,, 1
you, 1
know!, 1
Besides,, 1
with, 1
these, 1
men's, 1
clothes"--, 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
dress, 1
here?", 1
"Certainly.", 1
"Shall, 1
you, 1
have, 1
time?", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
uneasy,, 1
you, 1
little, 1
coward!, 1
All, 1
our, 1
servants, 1
are, 1
busy,, 1
discussing, 1
the, 1
grand, 1
affair., 1
Besides,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
there, 1
astonishing,, 1
when, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shut, 1
myself, 1
up?--tell, 1
me!", 1
"No,, 1
truly--you, 1
comfort, 1
me.", 1
"Come, 1
and, 1
help, 1
me.", 1
From, 1
the, 1
same, 1
drawer, 1
she, 1
took, 1
a, 1
man's, 1
complete, 1
costume,, 1
from, 1
the, 1
boots, 1
to, 1
the, 1
coat,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
provision, 1
of, 1
linen,, 1
where, 1
there, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
superfluous,, 1
but, 1
every, 1
requisite., 1
Then,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
promptitude, 1
which, 1
indicated, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
she, 1
had, 1
amused, 1
herself, 1
by, 1
adopting, 1
the, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
sex,, 1
Eugenie, 1
drew, 1
on, 1
the, 1
boots, 1
and, 1
pantaloons,, 1
tied, 1
her, 1
cravat,, 1
buttoned, 1
her, 1
waistcoat, 1
up, 1
to, 1
the, 1
throat,, 1
and, 1
put, 1
on, 1
a, 1
coat, 1
which, 1
admirably, 1
fitted, 1
her, 1
beautiful, 1
figure., 1
"Oh,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
very, 1
good--indeed,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
good!", 1
said, 1
Louise,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
admiration;, 1
"but, 1
that, 1
beautiful, 1
black, 1
hair,, 1
those, 1
magnificent, 1
braids,, 1
which, 1
made, 1
all, 1
the, 1
ladies, 1
sigh, 1
with, 1
envy,--will, 1
they, 1
go, 1
under, 1
a, 1
man's, 1
hat, 1
like, 1
the, 1
one, 1
I, 1
see, 1
down, 1
there?", 1
"You, 1
shall, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie., 1
And, 1
with, 1
her, 1
left, 1
hand, 1
seizing, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
mass,, 1
which, 1
her, 1
long, 1
fingers, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
grasp,, 1
she, 1
took, 1
in, 1
her, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
a, 1
pair, 1
of, 1
long, 1
scissors,, 1
and, 1
soon, 1
the, 1
steel, 1
met, 1
through, 1
the, 1
rich, 1
and, 1
splendid, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
fell, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cluster, 1
at, 1
her, 1
feet, 1
as, 1
she, 1
leaned, 1
back, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
it, 1
from, 1
her, 1
coat., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
front, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
also, 1
cut, 1
off,, 1
without, 1
expressing, 1
the, 1
least, 1
regret;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled, 1
with, 1
greater, 1
pleasure, 1
than, 1
usual, 1
under, 1
her, 1
ebony, 1
eyebrows., 1
"Oh,, 1
the, 1
magnificent, 1
hair!", 1
said, 1
Louise,, 1
with, 1
regret., 1
"And, 1
am, 1
I, 1
not, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times, 1
better, 1
thus?", 1
cried, 1
Eugenie,, 1
smoothing, 1
the, 1
scattered, 1
curls, 1
of, 1
her, 1
hair,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
now, 1
quite, 1
a, 1
masculine, 1
appearance;, 1
"and, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
think, 1
me, 1
handsomer, 1
so?", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
beautiful--always, 1
beautiful!", 1
cried, 1
Louise., 1
"Now,, 1
where, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going?", 1
"To, 1
Brussels,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
like;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
nearest, 1
frontier., 1
We, 1
can, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Brussels,, 1
Liege,, 1
Aix-la-Chapelle;, 1
then, 1
up, 1
the, 1
Rhine, 1
to, 1
Strasburg., 1
We, 1
will, 1
cross, 1
Switzerland,, 1
and, 1
go, 1
down, 1
into, 1
Italy, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Saint-Gothard., 1
Will, 1
that, 1
do?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
looking, 1
at?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
you;, 1
indeed, 1
you, 1
are, 1
adorable, 1
like, 1
that!, 1
One, 1
would, 1
say, 1
you, 1
were, 1
carrying, 1
me, 1
off.", 1
"And, 1
they, 1
would, 1
be, 1
right,, 1
pardieu!", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
swore,, 1
Eugenie.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
girls,, 1
whom, 1
every, 1
one, 1
might, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
plunged, 1
in, 1
grief,, 1
the, 1
one, 1
on, 1
her, 1
own, 1
account,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
from, 1
interest, 1
in, 1
her, 1
friend,, 1
burst, 1
out, 1
laughing,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
cleared, 1
away, 1
every, 1
visible, 1
trace, 1
of, 1
the, 1
disorder, 1
which, 1
had, 1
naturally, 1
accompanied, 1
the, 1
preparations, 1
for, 1
their, 1
escape., 1
Then,, 1
having, 1
blown, 1
out, 1
the, 1
lights,, 1
the, 1
two, 1
fugitives,, 1
looking, 1
and, 1
listening, 1
eagerly,, 1
with, 1
outstretched, 1
necks,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dressing-room, 1
which, 1
led, 1
by, 1
a, 1
side, 1
staircase, 1
down, 1
to, 1
the, 1
yard,--Eugenie, 1
going, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
holding, 1
with, 1
one, 1
arm, 1
the, 1
portmanteau,, 1
which, 1
by, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
handle, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly, 1
scarcely, 1
raised, 1
with, 1
both, 1
hands., 1
The, 1
yard, 1
was, 1
empty;, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
was, 1
striking, 1
twelve., 1
The, 1
porter, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
bed., 1
Eugenie, 1
approached, 1
softly,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
sleeping, 1
soundly, 1
in, 1
an, 1
arm-chair, 1
in, 1
his, 1
lodge., 1
She, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Louise,, 1
took, 1
up, 1
the, 1
portmanteau,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
archway, 1
under, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
Eugenie, 1
concealed, 1
Louise, 1
in, 1
an, 1
angle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gateway,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
if, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
chanced, 1
to, 1
awake, 1
he, 1
might, 1
see, 1
but, 1
one, 1
person., 1
Then, 1
placing, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
full, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
which, 1
lit, 1
the, 1
yard,--"Gate!", 1
cried, 1
she,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
finest, 1
contralto, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
rapping, 1
at, 1
the, 1
window., 1
The, 1
porter, 1
got, 1
up, 1
as, 1
Eugenie, 1
expected,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
advanced, 1
some, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
was, 1
going, 1
out,, 1
but, 1
seeing, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
striking, 1
his, 1
boot, 1
impatiently, 1
with, 1
his, 1
riding-whip,, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
it, 1
immediately., 1
Louise, 1
slid, 1
through, 1
the, 1
half-open, 1
gate, 1
like, 1
a, 1
snake,, 1
and, 1
bounded, 1
lightly, 1
forward., 1
Eugenie,, 1
apparently, 1
calm,, 1
although, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
her, 1
heart, 1
beat, 1
somewhat, 1
faster, 1
than, 1
usual,, 1
went, 1
out, 1
in, 1
her, 1
turn., 1
A, 1
porter, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
and, 1
they, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
the, 1
portmanteau;, 1
then, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
girls,, 1
having, 1
told, 1
him, 1
to, 1
take, 1
it, 1
to, 1
No., 1
36,, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Victoire,, 1
walked, 1
behind, 1
this, 1
man,, 1
whose, 1
presence, 1
comforted, 1
Louise., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Eugenie,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
as, 1
strong, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Judith, 1
or, 1
a, 1
Delilah., 1
They, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
appointed, 1
spot., 1
Eugenie, 1
ordered, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
to, 1
put, 1
down, 1
the, 1
portmanteau,, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
some, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
money,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
rapped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
shutter, 1
sent, 1
him, 1
away., 1
The, 1
shutter, 1
where, 1
Eugenie, 1
had, 1
rapped, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
little, 1
laundress,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
previously, 1
warned,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
bed., 1
She, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Mademoiselle,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie,, 1
"let, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
get, 1
the, 1
post-chaise, 1
from, 1
the, 1
coach-house,, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
some, 1
post-horses, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
Here, 1
are, 1
five, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
his, 1
trouble.", 1
"Indeed,", 1
said, 1
Louise,, 1
"I, 1
admire, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
could, 1
almost, 1
say, 1
respect, 1
you.", 1
The, 1
laundress, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
in, 1
astonishment,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
she, 1
had, 1
been, 1
promised, 1
twenty, 1
louis,, 1
she, 1
made, 1
no, 1
remark., 1
In, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
post-boy, 1
and, 1
horses,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
harnessed,, 1
and, 1
put, 1
in, 1
the, 1
post-chaise, 1
in, 1
a, 1
minute,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
fastened, 1
the, 1
portmanteau, 1
on, 1
with, 1
the, 1
assistance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cord, 1
and, 1
strap., 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
passport,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
postilion,, 1
"which, 1
way, 1
are, 1
we, 1
going,, 1
young, 1
gentleman?", 1
"To, 1
Fontainebleau,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie, 1
with, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
masculine, 1
voice., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say?", 1
said, 1
Louise., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
giving, 1
them, 1
the, 1
slip,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"this, 1
woman, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
have, 1
given, 1
twenty, 1
louis, 1
may, 1
betray, 1
us, 1
for, 1
forty;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
alter, 1
our, 1
direction.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
jumped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
britzska,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
admirably, 1
arranged, 1
for, 1
sleeping, 1
in,, 1
without, 1
scarcely, 1
touching, 1
the, 1
step., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
always, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
music, 1
teacher,, 1
seating, 1
herself, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
her, 1
friend., 1
A, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
postilion,, 1
having, 1
been, 1
put, 1
in, 1
the, 1
right, 1
road,, 1
passed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
crack, 1
of, 1
his, 1
whip, 1
through, 1
the, 1
gateway, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Barriere, 1
Saint-Martin., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Louise,, 1
breathing, 1
freely,, 1
"here, 1
we, 1
are, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Paris.", 1
"Yes,, 1
my, 1
dear,, 1
the, 1
abduction, 1
is, 1
an, 1
accomplished, 1
fact,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
violence,", 1
said, 1
Louise., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
bring, 1
that, 1
forward, 1
as, 1
an, 1
extenuating, 1
circumstance,", 1
replied, 1
Eugenie., 1
These, 1
words, 1
were, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
which, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
made, 1
in, 1
rolling, 1
over, 1
the, 1
pavement, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Villette., 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
had, 1
a, 1
daughter., 1
Chapter, 1
98., 1
The, 1
Bell, 1
and, 1
Bottle, 1
Tavern., 1
And, 1
now, 1
let, 1
us, 1
leave, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
her, 1
friend, 1
pursuing, 1
their, 1
way, 1
to, 1
Brussels,, 1
and, 1
return, 1
to, 1
poor, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
so, 1
inopportunely, 1
interrupted, 1
in, 1
his, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
fortune., 1
Notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
youth,, 1
Master, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
a, 1
very, 1
skilful, 1
and, 1
intelligent, 1
boy., 1
We, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
that, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
rumor, 1
which, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
salon, 1
he, 1
had, 1
gradually, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
crossing, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
rooms, 1
at, 1
last, 1
disappeared., 1
But, 1
we, 1
have, 1
forgotten, 1
to, 1
mention, 1
one, 1
circumstance,, 1
which, 1
nevertheless, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
omitted;, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rooms, 1
he, 1
crossed,, 1
the, 1
trousseau, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bride-elect, 1
was, 1
on, 1
exhibition., 1
There, 1
were, 1
caskets, 1
of, 1
diamonds,, 1
cashmere, 1
shawls,, 1
Valenciennes, 1
lace,, 1
English, 1
veilings,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
fact, 1
all, 1
the, 1
tempting, 1
things,, 1
the, 1
bare, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
which, 1
makes, 1
the, 1
hearts, 1
of, 1
young, 1
girls, 1
bound, 1
with, 1
joy,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
is, 1
called, 1
the, 1
"corbeille.", 1
[*], 1
Now,, 1
in, 1
passing, 1
through, 1
this, 1
room,, 1
Andrea, 1
proved, 1
himself, 1
not, 1
only, 1
to, 1
be, 1
clever, 1
and, 1
intelligent,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
provident,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
helped, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
most, 1
valuable, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ornaments, 1
before, 1
him., 1

in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
receptacle., 1
Furnished, 1
with, 1
this, 1
plunder,, 1
Andrea, 1
leaped, 1
with, 1
a, 1
lighter, 1
heart, 1
from, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
intending, 1
to, 1
slip, 1
through, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gendarmes., 1
Tall, 1
and, 1
well, 1
proportioned, 1
as, 1
an, 1
ancient, 1
gladiator,, 1
and, 1
muscular, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Spartan,, 1
he, 1
walked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
without, 1
knowing, 1
where, 1
to, 1
direct, 1
his, 1
steps,, 1
actuated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sole, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
getting, 1
away, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
if, 1
he, 1
lingered, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
surely, 1
be, 1
taken., 1
Having, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Mont, 1
Blanc,, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
the, 1
instinct, 1
which, 1
leads, 1
thieves, 1
always, 1
to, 1
take, 1
the, 1
safest, 1
path,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Lafayette., 1
There, 1
he, 1
stopped,, 1
breathless, 1
and, 1
panting., 1
He, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
alone;, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side, 1
was, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
wilderness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Saint-Lazare,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
Paris, 1
enshrouded, 1
in, 1
darkness., 1
"Am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
be, 1
captured?", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"no,, 1
not, 1
if, 1
I, 1
can, 1
use, 1
more, 1
activity, 1
than, 1
my, 1
enemies., 1
My, 1
safety, 1
is, 1
now, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
question, 1
of, 1
speed.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
cab, 1
at, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Poissonniere., 1
The, 1
dull, 1
driver,, 1
smoking, 1
his, 1
pipe,, 1
was, 1
plodding, 1
along, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
limits, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Denis,, 1
where, 1
no, 1

he, 1
ordinarily, 1
had, 1
his, 1
station., 1
"Ho,, 1
friend!", 1
said, 1
Benedetto., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
driver., 1
"Is, 1
your, 1
horse, 1
tired?", 1
"Tired?, 1
oh,, 1
yes,, 1
tired, 1
enough--he, 1
has, 1

Four, 1
wretched, 1
fares,, 1
and, 1
twenty, 1
sous, 1
over,, 1
making, 1
in, 1
all, 1
seven, 1
francs,, 1
are, 1
all, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
earned,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
take, 1
ten, 1
to, 1
the, 1
owner.", 1
"Will, 1
you, 1
add, 1
these, 1
twenty, 1
francs, 1
to, 1
the, 1
seven, 1
you, 1
have?", 1
"With, 1
pleasure,, 1
sir;, 1
twenty, 1
francs, 1
are, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
despised., 1
Tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
to, 1
do, 1
for, 1
this.", 1
"A, 1
very, 1
easy, 1
thing,, 1
if, 1
your, 1
horse, 1
isn't, 1
tired.", 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
he'll, 1
go, 1
like, 1
the, 1
wind,--only, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
which, 1
way, 1
to, 1
drive.", 1
"Towards, 1
the, 1
Louvres.", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
the, 1
way--you, 1
get, 1
good, 1
sweetened, 1
rum, 1
over, 1
there.", 1
"Exactly, 1
so;, 1
I, 1
merely, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
overtake, 1
one, 1
of, 1
my, 1
friends,, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
hunt, 1
to-morrow, 1
at, 1
Chapelle-en-Serval., 1
He, 1
should, 1
have, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
me, 1
here, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cabriolet, 1
till, 1
half-past, 1
eleven;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
twelve,, 1
and,, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
waiting,, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
gone, 1
on.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
likely.", 1
"Well,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
try, 1
and, 1
overtake, 1
him?", 1
"Nothing, 1
I, 1
should, 1
like, 1
better.", 1
"If, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
overtake, 1
him, 1
before, 1
we, 1
reach, 1
Bourget, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
twenty, 1
francs;, 1
if, 1
not, 1
before, 1
Louvres,, 1
thirty.", 1
"And, 1
if, 1
we, 1
do, 1
overtake, 1
him?", 1
"Forty,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
hesitation,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
safely, 1
promise., 1
"That's, 1
all, 1
right,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man;, 1
"hop, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
we're, 1
off!, 1
Who-o-o-p,, 1
la!", 1
Andrea, 1
got, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cab,, 1
which, 1
passed, 1
rapidly, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Denis,, 1
along, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Martin,, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
barrier,, 1
and, 1
threaded, 1
its, 1
way, 1
through, 1
the, 1
interminable, 1
Villette., 1
They, 1
never, 1
overtook, 1
the, 1
chimerical, 1
friend,, 1
yet, 1
Andrea, 1
frequently, 1
inquired, 1
of, 1
people, 1
on, 1
foot, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
inns, 1
which, 1
were, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
closed,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
green, 1
cabriolet, 1
and, 1
bay, 1
horse;, 1
and, 1
as, 1
there, 1
are, 1
a, 1
great, 1
many, 1
cabriolets, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Low, 1
Countries,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
nine-tenths, 1
of, 1
them, 1
are, 1
green,, 1
the, 1
inquiries, 1
increased, 1
at, 1
every, 1
step., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
had, 1
just, 1
seen, 1
it, 1
pass;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
five, 1
hundred,, 1
two, 1
hundred,, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
steps, 1
in, 1
advance;, 1
at, 1
length, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
it,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
friend., 1
Once, 1
the, 1
cab, 1
was, 1
also, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
calash, 1
rapidly, 1
whirled, 1
along, 1
by, 1
two, 1
post-horses., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
"if, 1
I, 1
only, 1
had, 1
that, 1
britzska,, 1
those, 1
two, 1
good, 1
post-horses,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
all, 1
the, 1
passport, 1
that, 1
carries, 1
them, 1
on!", 1
And, 1
he, 1
sighed, 1
deeply., 1
The, 1
calash, 1
contained, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly., 1
"Hurry,, 1
hurry!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"we, 1
must, 1
overtake, 1
him, 1
soon.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
horse, 1
resumed, 1
the, 1
desperate, 1
gallop, 1
it, 1
had, 1
kept, 1
up, 1
since, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
barrier,, 1
and, 1
arrived, 1
steaming, 1
at, 1
Louvres., 1
"Certainly,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
overtake, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
kill, 1
your, 1
horse,, 1
therefore, 1
I, 1
had, 1
better, 1
stop., 1
Here, 1
are, 1
thirty, 1
francs;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
sleep, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Red, 1
Horse,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
secure, 1
a, 1
place, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
coach., 1
Good-night,, 1
friend.", 1
And, 1
Andrea,, 1
after, 1
placing, 1
six, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
five, 1
francs, 1
each, 1
in, 1
the, 1
man's, 1
hand,, 1
leaped, 1
lightly, 1
on, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pathway., 1
The, 1
cabman, 1
joyfully, 1
pocketed, 1
the, 1
sum,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
back, 1
on, 1
his, 1
road, 1
to, 1
Paris., 1
Andrea, 1
pretended, 1
to, 1
go, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Red, 1
Horse, 1
inn,, 1
but, 1
after, 1
leaning, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
against, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
hearing, 1
the, 1
last, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cab,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
disappearing, 1
from, 1
view,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
on, 1
his, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
a, 1
lusty, 1
stride, 1
soon, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
space, 1
of, 1
two, 1
leagues., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
rested;, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
near, 1
Chapelle-en-Serval,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
pretended, 1
to, 1
be, 1
going., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
fatigue, 1
that, 1
stayed, 1
Andrea, 1
here;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
form, 1
some, 1
resolution,, 1
adopt, 1
some, 1
plan., 1
It, 1
would, 1
be, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
a, 1
diligence,, 1
equally, 1
so, 1
to, 1
engage, 1
post-horses;, 1
to, 1
travel, 1
either, 1
way, 1
a, 1
passport, 1
was, 1
necessary., 1
It, 1
was, 1
still, 1
more, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
department, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Oise,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
open, 1
and, 1
strictly, 1
guarded, 1
in, 1
France;, 1
this, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
question,, 1
especially, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man, 1
like, 1
Andrea,, 1
perfectly, 1
conversant, 1
with, 1
criminal, 1
matters., 1
He, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
moat,, 1
buried, 1
his, 1
face, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
reflected., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head;, 1
his, 1
resolution, 1
was, 1
made., 1
He, 1
threw, 1
some, 1
dust, 1
over, 1
the, 1
topcoat,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
found, 1
time, 1
to, 1
unhook, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ante-chamber, 1
and, 1
button, 1
over, 1
his, 1
ball, 1
costume,, 1
and, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Chapelle-en-Serval, 1
he, 1
knocked, 1
loudly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
only, 1
inn, 1
in, 1
the, 1
place., 1
The, 1
host, 1
opened., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
coming, 1
from, 1
Montefontaine, 1
to, 1
Senlis,, 1
when, 1
my, 1
horse,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
a, 1
troublesome, 1
creature,, 1
stumbled, 1
and, 1
threw, 1
me., 1
I, 1
must, 1
reach, 1
Compiegne, 1
to-night,, 1
or, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
cause, 1
deep, 1
anxiety, 1
to, 1
my, 1
family., 1
Could, 1
you, 1
let, 1
me, 1
hire, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
of, 1
you?", 1
An, 1
inn-keeper, 1
has, 1
always, 1
a, 1
horse, 1
to, 1
let,, 1
whether, 1
it, 1
be, 1
good, 1
or, 1
bad., 1
The, 1
host, 1
called, 1
the, 1
stable-boy,, 1
and, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
to, 1
saddle, 1
"Whitey,", 1
then, 1
he, 1
awoke, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
a, 1
child, 1
of, 1
seven, 1
years,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
ordered, 1
to, 1
ride, 1
before, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
and, 1
bring, 1
back, 1
the, 1
horse., 1
Andrea, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
inn-keeper, 1
twenty, 1
francs,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
taking, 1
them, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
dropped, 1
a, 1
visiting, 1
card., 1
This, 1
belonged, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friends, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1
Paris,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
innkeeper,, 1
picking, 1
it, 1
up, 1
after, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
left,, 1
was, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
let, 1
his, 1
horse, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Mauleon,, 1
25, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Dominique,, 1
that, 1
being, 1
the, 1
name, 1
and, 1
address, 1
on, 1
the, 1
card., 1
"Whitey", 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
fast, 1
animal,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
kept, 1
up, 1
an, 1
easy,, 1
steady, 1
pace;, 1
in, 1
three, 1
hours, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
traversed, 1
the, 1
nine, 1
leagues, 1
which, 1
separated, 1
him, 1
from, 1
Compiegne,, 1
and, 1
four, 1
o'clock, 1
struck, 1
as, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
place, 1
where, 1
the, 1
coaches, 1
stop., 1
There, 1
is, 1
an, 1
excellent, 1
tavern, 1
at, 1
Compiegne,, 1
well, 1
remembered, 1
by, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
ever, 1
been, 1
there., 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
often, 1
stayed, 1
there, 1
in, 1
his, 1
rides, 1
about, 1
Paris,, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
Bell, 1
and, 1
Bottle, 1
inn;, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
around,, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
sign, 1
by, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
a, 1
reflected, 1
lamp,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
dismissed, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
giving, 1
him, 1
all, 1
the, 1
small, 1
coin, 1
he, 1
had, 1
about, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
knocking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
very, 1
reasonably, 1
concluding, 1
that, 1
having, 1
now, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
hours, 1
before, 1
him, 1
he, 1
had, 1
best, 1
fortify, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
fatigues, 1
of, 1
the, 1
morrow, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sound, 1
sleep, 1
and, 1
a, 1
good, 1
supper., 1
A, 1
waiter, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
dining, 1
at, 1
Saint-Jean-au-Bois,, 1
and, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
the, 1
coach, 1
which, 1
passes, 1
by, 1
at, 1
midnight,, 1
but, 1
like, 1
a, 1
fool, 1
I, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
my, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
been, 1
walking, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
hours, 1
in, 1
the, 1
forest., 1
Show, 1
me, 1
into, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
pretty, 1
little, 1
rooms, 1
which, 1
overlook, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
bring, 1
me, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
fowl, 1
and, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
Bordeaux.", 1
The, 1
waiter, 1
had, 1
no, 1
suspicions;, 1
Andrea, 1
spoke, 1
with, 1
perfect, 1
composure,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
cigar, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
in, 1
the, 1
pocket, 1
of, 1
his, 1
top, 1
coat;, 1
his, 1
clothes, 1
were, 1
fashionably, 1
made,, 1
his, 1
chin, 1
smooth,, 1
his, 1
boots, 1
irreproachable;, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
merely, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
stayed, 1
out, 1
very, 1
late,, 1
that, 1
was, 1
all., 1
While, 1
the, 1
waiter, 1
was, 1
preparing, 1
his, 1
room,, 1
the, 1
hostess, 1
arose;, 1
Andrea, 1
assumed, 1
his, 1
most, 1
charming, 1
smile,, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
if, 1
he, 1
could, 1
have, 1
No., 1
3,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
occupied, 1
on, 1
his, 1
last, 1
stay, 1
at, 1
Compiegne., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
No., 1
3, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
by, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
travelling, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sister., 1
Andrea, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
despair,, 1
but, 1
consoled, 1
himself, 1
when, 1
the, 1
hostess, 1
assured, 1
him, 1
that, 1
No., 1
7,, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
him,, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
precisely, 1
the, 1
same, 1
as, 1
No., 1
3,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
warming, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
and, 1
chatting, 1
about, 1
the, 1
last, 1
races, 1
at, 1
Chantilly,, 1
he, 1
waited, 1
until, 1
they, 1
announced, 1
his, 1
room, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ready., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
not, 1
spoken, 1
without, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pretty, 1
rooms, 1
looking, 1
out, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
court, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Bell, 1
Tavern,, 1
which, 1
with, 1
its, 1
triple, 1
galleries, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
theatre,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
jessamine, 1
and, 1
clematis, 1
twining, 1
round, 1
the, 1
light, 1
columns,, 1
forms, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prettiest, 1
entrances, 1
to, 1
an, 1
inn, 1
that, 1
you, 1
can, 1
imagine., 1
The, 1
fowl, 1
was, 1
tender,, 1
the, 1
wine, 1
old,, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
clear, 1
and, 1
sparkling,, 1
and, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
surprised, 1
to, 1
find, 1
himself, 1
eating, 1
with, 1
as, 1
good, 1
an, 1
appetite, 1
as, 1
though, 1
nothing, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
that, 1
deep, 1
sleep, 1
which, 1
is, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
men, 1
of, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1
of, 1
age,, 1
even, 1
when, 1
they, 1
are, 1
torn, 1
with, 1
remorse., 1
Now,, 1
here, 1
we, 1
are, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
own, 1
that, 1
Andrea, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
felt, 1
remorse,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not., 1
This, 1
was, 1
the, 1
plan, 1
which, 1
had, 1
appealed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
afford, 1
the, 1
best, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
security., 1
Before, 1
daybreak, 1
he, 1
would, 1
awake,, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
inn, 1
after, 1
rigorously, 1
paying, 1
his, 1
bill,, 1
and, 1
reaching, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
he, 1
would,, 1
under, 1
pretence, 1
of, 1
making, 1
studies, 1
in, 1
painting,, 1
test, 1
the, 1
hospitality, 1
of, 1
some, 1
peasants,, 1
procure, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
dress, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woodcutter, 1
and, 1
a, 1
hatchet,, 1
casting, 1
off, 1
the, 1
lion's, 1
skin, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
woodman;, 1
then,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
dirt,, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
darkened, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
a, 1
leaden, 1
comb,, 1
his, 1
complexion, 1
embrowned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
preparation, 1
for, 1
which, 1
one, 1
of, 1
his, 1
old, 1
comrades, 1
had, 1
given, 1
him, 1
the, 1
recipe,, 1
he, 1
intended,, 1
by, 1
following, 1
the, 1
wooded, 1
districts,, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
nearest, 1
frontier,, 1
walking, 1
by, 1
night, 1
and, 1
sleeping, 1
in, 1
the, 1
day, 1
in, 1
the, 1
forests, 1
and, 1
quarries,, 1
and, 1
only, 1
entering, 1
inhabited, 1
regions, 1
to, 1
buy, 1
a, 1
loaf, 1
from, 1
time, 1
to, 1
time., 1
Once, 1
past, 1
the, 1
frontier,, 1
Andrea, 1
proposed, 1
making, 1
money, 1
of, 1
his, 1
diamonds;, 1
and, 1
by, 1
uniting, 1
the, 1
proceeds, 1
to, 1
ten, 1
bank-notes, 1
he, 1
always, 1
carried, 1
about, 1
with, 1
him, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
accident,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
then, 1
find, 1
himself, 1
possessor, 1
of, 1
about, 1
50,000, 1
livres,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
philosophically, 1
considered, 1
as, 1
no, 1
very, 1
deplorable, 1
condition, 1
after, 1
all., 1
Moreover,, 1
he, 1
reckoned, 1
much, 1
on, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
hush, 1
up, 1
the, 1
rumor, 1
of, 1
their, 1
own, 1
misadventures., 1
These, 1
were, 1
the, 1
reasons, 1
which,, 1
added, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fatigue,, 1
caused, 1
Andrea, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
so, 1
soundly., 1
In, 1
order, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
awaken, 1
early, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
close, 1
the, 1
shutters,, 1
but, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
bolting, 1
the, 1
door, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
an, 1
unclasped, 1
and, 1
long-pointed, 1
knife,, 1
whose, 1
temper, 1
he, 1
well, 1
knew,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
never, 1
absent, 1
from, 1
him., 1
About, 1
seven, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
awakened, 1
by, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
sunlight,, 1
which, 1
played,, 1
warm, 1
and, 1
brilliant,, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
face., 1
In, 1
all, 1
well-organized, 1
brains,, 1
the, 1
predominating, 1
idea--and, 1
there, 1
always, 1
is, 1
one--is, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
last, 1
thought, 1
before, 1
sleeping,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
first, 1
upon, 1
waking, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
when, 1
his, 1
predominating, 1
idea, 1
presented, 1
itself,, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ear, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
slept, 1
too, 1
long., 1
He, 1
jumped, 1
out, 1
of, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window., 1
A, 1
gendarme, 1
was, 1
crossing, 1
the, 1
court., 1
A, 1
gendarme, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
striking, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
even, 1
to, 1
a, 1
man, 1
void, 1
of, 1
uneasiness;, 1
but, 1
for, 1
one, 1
who, 1
has, 1
a, 1
timid, 1
conscience,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
good, 1
cause, 1
too,, 1
the, 1
yellow,, 1
blue,, 1
and, 1
white, 1
uniform, 1
is, 1
really, 1
very, 1
alarming., 1
"Why, 1
is, 1
that, 1
gendarme, 1
there?", 1
asked, 1
Andrea, 1
of, 1
himself., 1
Then,, 1
all, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
he, 1
replied,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
logic, 1
which, 1
the, 1
reader, 1
has,, 1
doubtless,, 1
remarked, 1
in, 1
him,, 1
"There, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
astonishing, 1
in, 1
seeing, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
at, 1
an, 1
inn;, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
being, 1
astonished,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
dress, 1
myself.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
youth, 1
dressed, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
a, 1
facility, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
had, 1
failed, 1
to, 1
rob, 1
him, 1
of, 1
during, 1
the, 1
two, 1
months, 1
of, 1
fashionable, 1
life, 1
he, 1
had, 1
led, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
"Now, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
while, 1
dressing, 1
himself,, 1
"I'll, 1
wait, 1
till, 1
he, 1
leaves,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I'll, 1
slip, 1
away.", 1
And,, 1
saying, 1
this,, 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
now, 1
put, 1
on, 1
his, 1
boots, 1
and, 1
cravat,, 1
stole, 1
gently, 1
to, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
the, 1
muslin, 1
curtain., 1
Not, 1
only, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
gendarme, 1
still, 1
there,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
now, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
second, 1
yellow,, 1
blue,, 1
and, 1
white, 1
uniform, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
staircase,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
one, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
descend,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
third,, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
holding, 1
a, 1
musket, 1
in, 1
his, 1
fist,, 1
was, 1
posted, 1
as, 1
a, 1
sentinel, 1
at, 1
the, 1
great, 1
street, 1
door, 1
which, 1
alone, 1
afforded, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
egress., 1
The, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
third, 1
gendarme, 1
settled, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
curious, 1
loungers, 1
was, 1
extended, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
effectually, 1
blocking, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
"They're, 1
after, 1
me!", 1
was, 1
Andrea's, 1
first, 1
thought., 1
"The, 1
devil!", 1
A, 1
pallor, 1
overspread, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him, 1
with, 1
anxiety., 1
His, 1
room,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
those, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
floor,, 1
had, 1
but, 1
one, 1
outlet, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gallery, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
everybody., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
lost!", 1
was, 1
his, 1
second, 1
thought;, 1
and,, 1
indeed,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
Andrea's, 1
situation,, 1
an, 1
arrest, 1
meant, 1
the, 1
assizes,, 1
trial,, 1
and, 1
death,--death, 1
without, 1
mercy, 1
or, 1
delay., 1
For, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
he, 1
convulsively, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
head, 1
within, 1
his, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
during, 1
that, 1
brief, 1
period, 1
he, 1
became, 1
nearly, 1
mad, 1
with, 1
terror;, 1
but, 1
soon, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
hope, 1
glimmered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
thoughts, 1
which, 1
bewildered, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
smile, 1
played, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
white, 1
lips, 1
and, 1
pallid, 1
cheeks., 1
He, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
objects, 1
of, 1
his, 1
search, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
a, 1
pen,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper., 1
With, 1
forced, 1
composure, 1
he, 1
dipped, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
following, 1
lines, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
paper:--, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
money, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
my, 1
bill,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
a, 1
dishonest, 1
man;, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
behind, 1
me, 1
as, 1
a, 1
pledge, 1
this, 1
pin,, 1
worth, 1
ten, 1
times, 1
the, 1
amount., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
excused, 1
for, 1
leaving, 1
at, 1
daybreak,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
was, 1
ashamed.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
pin, 1
from, 1
his, 1
cravat, 1
and, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
paper., 1
This, 1
done,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
door, 1
fastened,, 1
he, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
the, 1
bolts, 1
and, 1
even, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
ajar,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
forgetting, 1
to, 1
close, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
slipping, 1
into, 1
the, 1
chimney, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
that, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
gymnastic, 1
exercise,, 1
having, 1
effaced, 1
the, 1
marks, 1
of, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
he, 1
commenced, 1
climbing, 1
the, 1
only, 1
opening, 1
which, 1
afforded, 1
him, 1
the, 1
means, 1
of, 1
escape., 1
At, 1
this, 1
precise, 1
time,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
gendarme, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
walked, 1
up-stairs,, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
commissary, 1
of, 1
police,, 1
and, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
the, 1
second, 1
gendarme, 1
who, 1
guarded, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
and, 1
was, 1
himself, 1
re-enforced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
one, 1
stationed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
indebted, 1
for, 1
this, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
following, 1
circumstances., 1
At, 1
daybreak,, 1
the, 1
telegraphs, 1
were, 1
set, 1
at, 1
work, 1
in, 1
all, 1
directions,, 1
and, 1
almost, 1
immediately, 1
the, 1
authorities, 1
in, 1
every, 1
district, 1
had, 1
exerted, 1
their, 1
utmost, 1
endeavors, 1
to, 1
arrest, 1
the, 1
murderer, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
Compiegne,, 1
that, 1
royal, 1
residence, 1
and, 1
fortified, 1
town,, 1
is, 1
well, 1
furnished, 1
with, 1
authorities,, 1
gendarmes,, 1
and, 1
commissaries, 1
of, 1
police;, 1
they, 1
therefore, 1
began, 1
operations, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
the, 1
telegraphic, 1
despatch, 1
arrived,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Bell, 1
and, 1
Bottle, 1
being, 1
the, 1
best-known, 1
hotel, 1
in, 1
the, 1
town,, 1
they, 1
had, 1
naturally, 1
directed, 1
their, 1
first, 1
inquiries, 1
there., 1
Now,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
reports, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sentinels, 1
guarding, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Ville,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
next, 1
door, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Bell, 1
and, 1
Bottle,, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
stated, 1
by, 1
others, 1
that, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
travellers, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
during, 1
the, 1
night., 1
The, 1
sentinel, 1
who, 1
was, 1
relieved, 1
at, 1
six, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
remembered, 1
perfectly, 1
that, 1
just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
taking, 1
his, 1
post, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
past, 1
four, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
arrived, 1
on, 1
horseback,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
little, 1
boy, 1
before, 1
him., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
having, 1
dismissed, 1
the, 1
boy, 1
and, 1
horse,, 1
knocked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
closed, 1
after, 1
his, 1
entrance., 1
This, 1
late, 1
arrival, 1
had, 1
attracted, 1
much, 1
suspicion,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
being, 1
no, 1
other, 1
than, 1
Andrea,, 1
the, 1
commissary, 1
and, 1
gendarme,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
a, 1
brigadier,, 1
directed, 1
their, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
room., 1
They, 1
found, 1
the, 1
door, 1
ajar., 1
"Oh,, 1
ho,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier,, 1
who, 1
thoroughly, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
trick;, 1
"a, 1
bad, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
door, 1
open!, 1
I, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
find, 1
it, 1
triply, 1
bolted.", 1
And,, 1
indeed,, 1
the, 1
little, 1
note, 1
and, 1
pin, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
table, 1
confirmed,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
corroborated,, 1
the, 1
sad, 1
truth., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
fled., 1
We, 1
say, 1
corroborated,, 1
because, 1
the, 1
brigadier, 1
was, 1
too, 1
experienced, 1
to, 1
be, 1
convinced, 1
by, 1
a, 1
single, 1
proof., 1
He, 1
glanced, 1
around,, 1
looked, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
shook, 1
the, 1
curtains,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
closets,, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
chimney., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
no, 1
traces, 1
of, 1
his, 1
feet, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ashes,, 1
but, 1
still, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
outlet,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
this, 1
light, 1
was, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
without, 1
serious, 1
investigation., 1
The, 1
brigadier, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
some, 1
sticks, 1
and, 1
straw,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
filled, 1
the, 1
chimney, 1
with, 1
them,, 1
set, 1
a, 1
light, 1
to, 1
it., 1
The, 1
fire, 1
crackled,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
smoke, 1
ascended, 1
like, 1
the, 1
dull, 1
vapor, 1
from, 1
a, 1
volcano;, 1
but, 1
still, 1
no, 1
prisoner, 1
fell, 1
down,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
expected., 1
The, 1
fact, 1
was,, 1
that, 1
Andrea,, 1
at, 1
war, 1
with, 1
society, 1
ever, 1
since, 1
his, 1
youth,, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
as, 1
deep, 1
as, 1
a, 1
gendarme,, 1
even, 1
though, 1
he, 1
were, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
rank, 1
of, 1
brigadier,, 1
and, 1
quite, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
climbed, 1
out, 1
on, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
and, 1
was, 1
crouching, 1
down, 1
against, 1
the, 1
chimney-pots., 1
At, 1
one, 1
time, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
was, 1
saved,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
brigadier, 1
exclaim, 1
in, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
voice,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
gendarmes,, 1
"He, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here!", 1
But, 1
venturing, 1
to, 1
peep,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
the, 1
latter,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
retiring,, 1
as, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
reasonably, 1
expected, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
announcement,, 1
were, 1
watching, 1
with, 1
increased, 1
attention., 1
It, 1
was, 1
now, 1
his, 1
turn, 1
to, 1
look, 1
about, 1
him;, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Ville,, 1
a, 1
massive, 1
sixteenth, 1
century, 1
building,, 1
was, 1
on, 1
his, 1
right;, 1
any, 1
one, 1
could, 1
descend, 1
from, 1
the, 1
openings, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tower,, 1
and, 1
examine, 1
every, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
below,, 1
and, 1
Andrea, 1
expected, 1
momentarily, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
appear, 1
at, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
openings., 1
If, 1
once, 1
discovered,, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
lost,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
afforded, 1
no, 1
chance, 1
of, 1
escape;, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
descend,, 1
not, 1
through, 1
the, 1
same, 1
chimney, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
come, 1
up,, 1
but, 1
by, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
one, 1
conducting, 1
to, 1
another, 1
room., 1
He, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
a, 1
chimney, 1
from, 1
which, 1
no, 1
smoke, 1
issued,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
reached, 1
it,, 1
he, 1
disappeared, 1
through, 1
the, 1
orifice, 1
without, 1
being, 1
seen, 1
by, 1
any, 1
one., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
minute,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
windows, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Ville, 1
was, 1
thrown, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
a, 1
gendarme, 1
appeared., 1
For, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
it, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
decorations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
building,, 1
then, 1
after, 1
a, 1
long, 1
sigh, 1
of, 1
disappointment, 1
the, 1
head, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
brigadier,, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
dignified, 1
as, 1
the, 1
law, 1
he, 1
represented,, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
without, 1
answering, 1
the, 1
thousand, 1
questions, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
re-entered, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
two, 1
gendarmes., 1
"Well,, 1
my, 1
boys,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier,, 1
"the, 1
brigand, 1
must, 1
really, 1
have, 1
escaped, 1
early, 1
this, 1
morning;, 1
but, 1
we, 1
will, 1
send, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Villers-Coterets, 1
and, 1
Noyon, 1
roads,, 1
and, 1
search, 1
the, 1
forest,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
catch, 1
him,, 1
no, 1
doubt.", 1
The, 1
honorable, 1
functionary, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
expressed, 1
himself, 1
thus,, 1
in, 1
that, 1
intonation, 1
which, 1
is, 1
peculiar, 1
to, 1
brigadiers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gendarmerie,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
scream,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
violent, 1
ringing, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bell,, 1
resounded, 1
through, 1
the, 1
court, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel., 1
"Ah,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
brigadier., 1
"Some, 1
traveller, 1
seems, 1
impatient,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
host., 1
"What, 1
number, 1
was, 1
it, 1
that, 1
rang?", 1
"Number, 1
3.", 1
"Run,, 1
waiter!", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
screams, 1
and, 1
ringing, 1
were, 1
redoubled., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier,, 1
stopping, 1
the, 1
servant,, 1
"the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
is, 1
ringing, 1
appears, 1
to, 1
want, 1
something, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
waiter;, 1
we, 1
will, 1
attend, 1
upon, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gendarme., 1
Who, 1
occupies, 1
Number, 1
3?", 1
"The, 1
little, 1
fellow, 1
who, 1
arrived, 1
last, 1
night, 1
in, 1
a, 1
post-chaise, 1
with, 1
his, 1
sister,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
an, 1
apartment, 1
with, 1
two, 1
beds.", 1
The, 1
bell, 1
here, 1
rang, 1
for, 1
the, 1
third, 1
time,, 1
with, 1
another, 1
shriek, 1
of, 1
anguish., 1
"Follow, 1
me,, 1
Mr., 1
Commissary!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier;, 1
"tread, 1
in, 1
my, 1
steps.", 1
"Wait, 1
an, 1
instant,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
host;, 1
"Number, 1
3, 1
has, 1
two, 1
staircases,--inside, 1
and, 1
outside.", 1
"Good,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
brigadier., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
charge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inside, 1
one., 1
Are, 1
the, 1
carbines, 1
loaded?", 1
"Yes,, 1
brigadier.", 1
"Well,, 1
you, 1
guard, 1
the, 1
exterior,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
he, 1
attempts, 1
to, 1
fly,, 1
fire, 1
upon, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
a, 1
great, 1
criminal,, 1
from, 1
what, 1
the, 1
telegraph, 1
says.", 1
The, 1
brigadier,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
commissary,, 1
disappeared, 1
by, 1
the, 1
inside, 1
staircase,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
which, 1
his, 1
assertions, 1
respecting, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
excited, 1
in, 1
the, 1
crowd., 1
This, 1
is, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
very, 1
cleverly, 1
managed, 1
to, 1
descend, 1
two-thirds, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chimney,, 1
but, 1
then, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
slipped,, 1
and, 1
notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
endeavors,, 1
he, 1
came, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
more, 1
speed, 1
and, 1
noise, 1
than, 1
he, 1
intended., 1
It, 1
would, 1
have, 1
signified, 1
little, 1
had, 1
the, 1
room, 1
been, 1
empty,, 1
but, 1
unfortunately, 1
it, 1
was, 1
occupied., 1
Two, 1
ladies,, 1
sleeping, 1
in, 1
one, 1
bed,, 1
were, 1
awakened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
noise,, 1
and, 1
fixing, 1
their, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
whence, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
proceeded,, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
man., 1
One, 1
of, 1
these, 1
ladies,, 1
the, 1
fair, 1
one,, 1
uttered, 1
those, 1
terrible, 1
shrieks, 1
which, 1
resounded, 1
through, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
rushing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bell-rope,, 1
rang, 1
with, 1
all, 1
her, 1
strength., 1
Andrea,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
can, 1
see,, 1
was, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
misfortune., 1
"For, 1
pity's, 1
sake,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
bewildered,, 1
without, 1
seeing, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
addressing,--"for, 1
pity's, 1
sake, 1
do, 1
not, 1
call, 1
assistance!, 1
Save, 1
me!--I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
harm, 1
you.", 1
"Andrea,, 1
the, 1
murderer!", 1
cried, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ladies., 1
"Eugenie!, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Andrea,, 1
stupefied., 1
"Help,, 1
help!", 1
cried, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
from, 1
her, 1
companion's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
ringing, 1
it, 1
yet, 1
more, 1
violently., 1
"Save, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
pursued!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
clasping, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"For, 1
pity,, 1
for, 1
mercy's, 1
sake, 1
do, 1
not, 1
deliver, 1
me, 1
up!", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
too, 1
late,, 1
they, 1
are, 1
coming,", 1
said, 1
Eugenie., 1
"Well,, 1
conceal, 1
me, 1
somewhere;, 1
you, 1
can, 1
say, 1
you, 1
were, 1
needlessly, 1
alarmed;, 1
you, 1
can, 1
turn, 1
their, 1
suspicions, 1
and, 1
save, 1
my, 1
life!", 1
The, 1
two, 1
ladies,, 1
pressing, 1
closely, 1
to, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
drawing, 1
the, 1
bedclothes, 1
tightly, 1
around, 1
them,, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
to, 1
this, 1
supplicating, 1
voice,, 1
repugnance, 1
and, 1
fear, 1
taking, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
their, 1
minds., 1
"Well,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
so,", 1
at, 1
length, 1
said, 1
Eugenie;, 1
"return, 1
by, 1
the, 1
same, 1
road, 1
you, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
will, 1
say, 1
nothing, 1
about, 1
you,, 1
unhappy, 1
wretch.", 1
"Here, 1
he, 1
is,, 1
here, 1
he, 1
is!", 1
cried, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
from, 1
the, 1
landing;, 1
"here, 1
he, 1
is!, 1
I, 1
see, 1
him!", 1
The, 1
brigadier, 1
had, 1
put, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
to, 1
the, 1
keyhole,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
discovered, 1
Andrea, 1
in, 1
a, 1
posture, 1
of, 1
entreaty., 1
A, 1
violent, 1
blow, 1
from, 1
the, 1
butt, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
musket, 1
burst, 1
open, 1
the, 1
lock,, 1
two, 1
more, 1
forced, 1
out, 1
the, 1
bolts,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
door, 1
fell, 1
in., 1
Andrea, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
door,, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
the, 1
gallery,, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
rush, 1
out;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
stopped, 1
short,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
stood, 1
with, 1
his, 1
body, 1
a, 1
little, 1
thrown, 1
back,, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
useless, 1
knife, 1
in, 1
his, 1
clinched, 1
hand., 1
"Fly,, 1
then!", 1
cried, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
whose, 1
pity, 1
returned, 1
as, 1
her, 1
fears, 1
diminished;, 1
"fly!", 1
"Or, 1
kill, 1
yourself!", 1
said, 1
Eugenie, 1
(in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
a, 1
Vestal, 1
in, 1
the, 1
amphitheatre, 1
would, 1
have, 1
used,, 1
when, 1
urging, 1
the, 1
victorious, 1
gladiator, 1
to, 1
finish, 1
his, 1
vanquished, 1
adversary)., 1
Andrea, 1
shuddered,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
proved, 1
how, 1
little, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
such, 1
ferocious, 1
honor., 1
"Kill, 1
myself?", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
throwing, 1
down, 1
his, 1
knife;, 1
"why, 1
should, 1
I, 1
do, 1
so?", 1
"Why,, 1
you, 1
said,", 1
answered, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
would, 1
be, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
die, 1
like, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
criminals.", 1
"Bah,", 1
said, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
crossing, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
"one, 1
has, 1
friends.", 1
The, 1
brigadier, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
sword, 1
in, 1
hand., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"sheathe, 1
your, 1
sword,, 1
my, 1
fine, 1
fellow;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
make, 1
such, 1
a, 1
fuss,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
give, 1
myself, 1
up;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
held, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
be, 1
manacled., 1
The, 1
girls, 1
looked, 1
with, 1
horror, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
shameful, 1
metamorphosis,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world, 1
shaking, 1
off, 1
his, 1
covering, 1
and, 1
appearing, 1
as, 1
a, 1
galley-slave., 1
Andrea, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
impertinent, 1
smile, 1
asked,--"Have, 1
you, 1
any, 1
message, 1
for, 1
your, 1
father,, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars,, 1
for, 1
in, 1
all, 1
probability, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
return, 1
to, 1
Paris?", 1
Eugenie, 1
covered, 1
her, 1
face, 1
with, 1
her, 1
hands., 1
"Oh,, 1
ho!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"you, 1
need, 1
not, 1
be, 1
ashamed,, 1
even, 1
though, 1
you, 1
did, 1
post, 1
after, 1
me., 1
Was, 1
I, 1
not, 1
nearly, 1
your, 1
husband?", 1
And, 1
with, 1
this, 1
raillery, 1
Andrea, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
two, 1
girls, 1
a, 1
prey, 1
to, 1
their, 1
own, 1
feelings, 1
of, 1
shame,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
the, 1
comments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
after, 1
they, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
their, 1
calash,, 1
both, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
feminine, 1
attire., 1
The, 1
gate, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
had, 1
been, 1
closed, 1
to, 1
screen, 1
them, 1
from, 1
sight,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
forced,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
open,, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
a, 1
throng, 1
of, 1
curious, 1
glances, 1
and, 1
whispering, 1
voices., 1
Eugenie, 1
closed, 1
her, 1
eyes;, 1
but, 1
though, 1
she, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see,, 1
she, 1
could, 1
hear,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sneers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
reached, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Oh,, 1
why, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
world, 1
a, 1
wilderness?", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
throwing, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
sparkling, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
rage, 1
which, 1
made, 1
Nero, 1
wish, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Roman, 1
world, 1
had, 1
but, 1
one, 1
neck,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
sever, 1
it, 1
at, 1
a, 1
single, 1
blow., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
they, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
de, 1
Flandre,, 1
at, 1
Brussels., 1
The, 1
same, 1
evening, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
incarcerated, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Conciergerie., 1
Chapter, 1
99., 1
The, 1
Law., 1
We, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
how, 1
quietly, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly, 1
accomplished, 1
their, 1
transformation, 1
and, 1
flight;, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
being, 1
that, 1
every, 1
one, 1
was, 1
too, 1
much, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
his, 1
or, 1
her, 1
own, 1
affairs, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
theirs., 1
We, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
contemplating, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
magnitude, 1
of, 1
his, 1
debt, 1
before, 1
the, 1
phantom, 1
of, 1
bankruptcy,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
who, 1
after, 1
being, 1
momentarily, 1
crushed, 1
under, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
blow, 1
which, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
her,, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
adviser,, 1
Lucien, 1
Debray., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
had, 1
looked, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
this, 1
marriage, 1
as, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
ridding, 1
her, 1
of, 1
a, 1
guardianship, 1
which,, 1
over, 1
a, 1
girl, 1
of, 1
Eugenie's, 1
character,, 1
could, 1
not, 1
fail, 1
to, 1
be, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
troublesome, 1
undertaking;, 1
for, 1
in, 1
the, 1
tacit, 1
relations, 1
which, 1
maintain, 1
the, 1
bond, 1
of, 1
family, 1
union,, 1
the, 1
mother,, 1
to, 1
maintain, 1
her, 1
ascendancy, 1
over, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
must, 1
never, 1
fail, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
model, 1
of, 1
wisdom, 1
and, 1
a, 1
type, 1
of, 1
perfection., 1
Now,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
feared, 1
Eugenie's, 1
sagacity, 1
and, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
frequently, 1
observed, 1
the, 1
contemptuous, 1
expression, 1
with, 1
which, 1
her, 1
daughter, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
Debray,--an, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
imply, 1
that, 1
she, 1
understood, 1
all, 1
her, 1
mother's, 1
amorous, 1
and, 1
pecuniary, 1
relationships, 1
with, 1
the, 1
intimate, 1
secretary;, 1
moreover,, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
Eugenie, 1
detested, 1
Debray,--not, 1
only, 1
because, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
source, 1
of, 1
dissension, 1
and, 1
scandal, 1
under, 1
the, 1
paternal, 1
roof,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
she, 1
had, 1
at, 1
once, 1
classed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
that, 1
catalogue, 1
of, 1
bipeds, 1
whom, 1
Plato, 1
endeavors, 1
to, 1
withdraw, 1
from, 1
the, 1
appellation, 1
of, 1
men,, 1
and, 1
whom, 1
Diogenes, 1
designated, 1
as, 1
animals, 1
upon, 1
two, 1
legs, 1
without, 1
feathers., 1
Unfortunately,, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world, 1
of, 1
ours,, 1
each, 1
person, 1
views, 1
things, 1
through, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
medium,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
is, 1
prevented, 1
from, 1
seeing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
light, 1
as, 1
others,, 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
therefore,, 1
very, 1
much, 1
regretted, 1
that, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
Eugenie, 1
had, 1
not, 1
taken, 1
place,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
because, 1
the, 1
match, 1
was, 1
good,, 1
and, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
insure, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
of, 1
her, 1
child,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
it, 1
would, 1
also, 1
set, 1
her, 1
at, 1
liberty., 1
She, 1
ran, 1
therefore, 1
to, 1
Debray,, 1
who,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
like, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
Paris, 1
witnessed, 1
the, 1
contract, 1
scene, 1
and, 1
the, 1
scandal, 1
attending, 1
it,, 1
had, 1
retired, 1
in, 1
haste, 1
to, 1
his, 1
club,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was, 1
chatting, 1
with, 1
some, 1
friends, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
events, 1
which, 1
served, 1
as, 1
a, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
conversation, 1
for, 1
three-fourths, 1
of, 1
that, 1
city, 1
known, 1
as, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world., 1
At, 1
the, 1
precise, 1
time, 1
when, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black, 1
and, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
long, 1
veil,, 1
was, 1
ascending, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
Debray's, 1
apartments,--notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
assurances, 1
of, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
not, 1
at, 1
home,--Debray, 1
was, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
repelling, 1
the, 1
insinuations, 1
of, 1
a, 1
friend,, 1
who, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
persuade, 1
him, 1
that, 1
after, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
scene, 1
which, 1
had, 1
just, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
he, 1
ought,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family,, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
her, 1
two, 1
millions., 1
Debray, 1
did, 1
not, 1
defend, 1
himself, 1
very, 1
warmly,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
had, 1
sometimes, 1
crossed, 1
his, 1
mind;, 1
still,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
independent,, 1
proud, 1
spirit, 1
of, 1
Eugenie,, 1
he, 1
positively, 1
rejected, 1
it, 1
as, 1
utterly, 1
impossible,, 1
though, 1
the, 1
same, 1
thought, 1
again, 1
continually, 1
recurred, 1
and, 1
found, 1
a, 1
resting-place, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
Tea,, 1
play,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
conversation,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
become, 1
interesting, 1
during, 1
the, 1
discussion, 1
of, 1
such, 1
serious, 1
affairs,, 1
lasted, 1
till, 1
one, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
veiled, 1
and, 1
uneasy,, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
Debray, 1
in, 1
the, 1
little, 1
green, 1
room,, 1
seated, 1
between, 1
two, 1
baskets, 1
of, 1
flowers,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
had, 1
that, 1
morning, 1
sent,, 1
and, 1
which,, 1
it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
confessed,, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
arranged, 1
and, 1
watered, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
care, 1
that, 1
his, 1
absence, 1
was, 1
half, 1
excused, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
woman., 1
At, 1
twenty, 1
minutes, 1
of, 1
twelve,, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
tired, 1
of, 1
waiting,, 1
returned, 1
home., 1
Women, 1
of, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
grade, 1
are, 1
like, 1
prosperous, 1
grisettes, 1
in, 1
one, 1
respect,, 1
they, 1
seldom, 1
return, 1
home, 1
after, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
caution, 1
as, 1
Eugenie, 1
used, 1
in, 1
leaving, 1
it;, 1
she, 1
ran, 1
lightly, 1
up-stairs,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
an, 1
aching, 1
heart, 1
entered, 1
her, 1
apartment,, 1
contiguous,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
know,, 1
to, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Eugenie., 1
She, 1
was, 1
fearful, 1
of, 1
exciting, 1
any, 1
remark,, 1
and, 1
believed, 1
firmly, 1
in, 1
her, 1
daughter's, 1
innocence, 1
and, 1
fidelity, 1
to, 1
the, 1
paternal, 1
roof., 1
She, 1
listened, 1
at, 1
Eugenie's, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
hearing, 1
no, 1
sound, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
enter,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
bolts, 1
were, 1
in, 1
place., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
then, 1
concluded, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
been, 1
overcome, 1
with, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
to, 1
sleep., 1
She, 1
called, 1
the, 1
maid, 1
and, 1
questioned, 1
her., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
maid,, 1
"retired, 1
to, 1
her, 1
apartment, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly;, 1
they, 1
then, 1
took, 1
tea, 1
together,, 1
after, 1
which, 1
they, 1
desired, 1
me, 1
to, 1
leave,, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
they, 1
needed, 1
me, 1
no, 1
longer.", 1
Since, 1
then, 1
the, 1
maid, 1
had, 1
been, 1
below,, 1
and, 1
like, 1
every, 1
one, 1
else, 1
she, 1
thought, 1
the, 1
young, 1
ladies, 1
were, 1
in, 1
their, 1
own, 1
room;, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
therefore,, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
without, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
suspicion,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
to, 1
muse, 1
over, 1
the, 1
recent, 1
events., 1
In, 1
proportion, 1
as, 1
her, 1
memory, 1
became, 1
clearer,, 1
the, 1
occurrences, 1
of, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
were, 1
revealed, 1
in, 1
their, 1
true, 1
light;, 1
what, 1
she, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
confusion, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tumult;, 1
what, 1
she, 1
had, 1
regarded, 1
as, 1
something, 1
distressing,, 1
was, 1
in, 1
reality, 1
a, 1
disgrace., 1
And, 1
then, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
she, 1
had, 1
felt, 1
no, 1
pity, 1
for, 1
poor, 1
Mercedes,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
afflicted, 1
with, 1
as, 1
severe, 1
a, 1
blow, 1
through, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
and, 1
son., 1
"Eugenie,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
to, 1
herself,, 1
"is, 1
lost,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
are, 1
we., 1
The, 1
affair,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
reported,, 1
will, 1
cover, 1
us, 1
with, 1
shame;, 1
for, 1
in, 1
a, 1
society, 1
such, 1
as, 1
ours, 1
satire, 1
inflicts, 1
a, 1
painful, 1
and, 1
incurable, 1
wound., 1
How, 1
fortunate, 1
that, 1
Eugenie, 1
is, 1
possessed, 1
of, 1
that, 1
strange, 1
character, 1
which, 1
has, 1
so, 1
often, 1
made, 1
me, 1
tremble!", 1
And, 1
her, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
heaven,, 1
where, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
providence, 1
disposes, 1
all, 1
things,, 1
and, 1
out, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fault,, 1
nay,, 1
even, 1
a, 1
vice,, 1
sometimes, 1
produces, 1
a, 1
blessing., 1
And, 1
then, 1
her, 1
thoughts,, 1
cleaving, 1
through, 1
space, 1
like, 1
a, 1
bird, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
This, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
a, 1
wretch,, 1
a, 1
robber,, 1
an, 1
assassin,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
his, 1
manners, 1
showed, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
education,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
one;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
the, 1
world, 1
with, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
fortune,, 1
supported, 1
by, 1
an, 1
honorable, 1
name., 1
How, 1
could, 1
she, 1
extricate, 1
herself, 1
from, 1
this, 1
labyrinth?, 1
To, 1
whom, 1
would, 1
she, 1
apply, 1
to, 1
help, 1
her, 1
out, 1
of, 1
this, 1
painful, 1
situation?, 1
Debray,, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
had, 1
run,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
first, 1
instinct, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
man, 1
she, 1
loves,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
yet, 1
betrays, 1
her,--Debray, 1
could, 1
but, 1
give, 1
her, 1
advice,, 1
she, 1
must, 1
apply, 1
to, 1
some, 1
one, 1
more, 1
powerful, 1
than, 1
he., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
then, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
It, 1
was, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
who, 1
had, 1
remorselessly, 1
brought, 1
misfortune, 1
into, 1
her, 1
family,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
strangers., 1
But,, 1
no;, 1
on, 1
reflection,, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
merciless, 1
man;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
slave, 1
to, 1
his, 1
duties,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
friend,, 1
the, 1
loyal, 1
friend,, 1
who, 1
roughly, 1
but, 1
firmly, 1
cut, 1
into, 1
the, 1
very, 1
core, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corruption;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
executioner,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
surgeon,, 1
who, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
withdraw, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
Danglars, 1
from, 1
ignominious, 1
association, 1
with, 1
the, 1
disgraced, 1
young, 1
man, 1
they, 1
had, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
the, 1
world, 1
as, 1
their, 1
son-in-law., 1
And, 1
since, 1
Villefort,, 1
the, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
had, 1
acted, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way,, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
suppose, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
previously, 1
acquainted, 1
with,, 1
or, 1
had, 1
lent, 1
himself, 1
to,, 1
any, 1
of, 1
Andrea's, 1
intrigues., 1
Villefort's, 1
conduct,, 1
therefore,, 1
upon, 1
reflection,, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
as, 1
if, 1
shaped, 1
for, 1
their, 1
mutual, 1
advantage., 1
But, 1
the, 1
inflexibility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
should, 1
stop, 1
there;, 1
she, 1
would, 1
see, 1
him, 1
the, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
she, 1
could, 1
not, 1
make, 1
him, 1
fail, 1
in, 1
his, 1
duties, 1
as, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
she, 1
would,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
obtain, 1
all, 1
the, 1
indulgence, 1
he, 1
could, 1
allow., 1
She, 1
would, 1
invoke, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
recall, 1
old, 1
recollections;, 1
she, 1
would, 1
supplicate, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
remembrance, 1
of, 1
guilty,, 1
yet, 1
happy, 1
days., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
would, 1
stifle, 1
the, 1
affair;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
and, 1
allow, 1
Andrea, 1
to, 1
fly,, 1
and, 1
follow, 1
up, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
under, 1
that, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
guilt, 1
called, 1
contempt, 1
of, 1
court., 1
And, 1
after, 1
this, 1
reasoning, 1
she, 1
slept, 1
easily., 1
At, 1
nine, 1
o'clock, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
she, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
ringing, 1
for, 1
her, 1
maid, 1
or, 1
giving, 1
the, 1
least, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
her, 1
activity,, 1
she, 1
dressed, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
simple, 1
style, 1
as, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
night;, 1
then, 1
running, 1
down-stairs,, 1
she, 1
left, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
walked, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
Provence,, 1
called, 1
a, 1
cab,, 1
and, 1
drove, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
house., 1
For, 1
the, 1
last, 1
month, 1
this, 1
wretched, 1
house, 1
had, 1
presented, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
lazaretto, 1
infected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
plague., 1
Some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartments, 1
were, 1
closed, 1
within, 1
and, 1
without;, 1
the, 1
shutters, 1
were, 1
only, 1
opened, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
a, 1
minute's, 1
air,, 1
showing, 1
the, 1
scared, 1
face, 1
of, 1
a, 1
footman,, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
window, 1
would, 1
be, 1
closed,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
gravestone, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
a, 1
sepulchre,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
neighbors, 1
would, 1
say, 1
to, 1
each, 1
other, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
"Will, 1
there, 1
be, 1
another, 1
funeral, 1
to-day, 1
at, 1
the, 1
procureur's, 1
house?", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
involuntarily, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
desolate, 1
aspect, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mansion;, 1
descending, 1
from, 1
the, 1
cab,, 1
she, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
door, 1
with, 1
trembling, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell., 1
Three, 1
times, 1
did, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
ring, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dull,, 1
heavy, 1
sound,, 1
seeming, 1
to, 1
participate,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
general, 1
sadness,, 1
before, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
appeared, 1
and, 1
peeped, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
just, 1
wide, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
his, 1
words, 1
to, 1
be, 1
heard., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
lady,, 1
a, 1
fashionable,, 1
elegantly, 1
dressed, 1
lady,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
door, 1
remained, 1
almost, 1
closed., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"First,, 1
madame,, 1
who, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
"Who, 1
am, 1
I?, 1
You, 1
know, 1
me, 1
well, 1
enough.", 1
"We, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
know, 1
any, 1
one,, 1
madame.", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
be, 1
mad,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"Where, 1
do, 1
you, 1
come, 1
from?", 1
"Oh,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
too, 1
much!", 1
"Madame,, 1
these, 1
are, 1
my, 1
orders;, 1
excuse, 1
me., 1
Your, 1
name?", 1
"The, 1
baroness, 1
Danglars;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
me, 1
twenty, 1
times.", 1
"Possibly,, 1
madame., 1
And, 1
now,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"Oh,, 1
how, 1
extraordinary!, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
complain, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
of, 1
the, 1
impertinence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
servants.", 1
"Madame,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
precaution,, 1
not, 1
impertinence;, 1
no, 1
one, 1
enters, 1
here, 1
without, 1
an, 1
order, 1
from, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
or, 1
without, 1
speaking, 1
to, 1
the, 1
procureur.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
business, 1
with, 1
the, 1
procureur.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
pressing, 1
business?", 1
"You, 1
can, 1
imagine, 1
so,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
even, 1
brought, 1
my, 1
carriage, 1
out, 1
yet., 1
But, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
this--here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
card,, 1
take, 1
it, 1
to, 1
your, 1
master.", 1
"Madame, 1
will, 1
await, 1
my, 1
return?", 1
"Yes;, 1
go.", 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
leaving, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
in, 1
the, 1
street., 1
She, 1
had, 1
not, 1
long, 1
to, 1
wait;, 1
directly, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened, 1
wide, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
she, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
through,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
again, 1
shut., 1
Without, 1
losing, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
her, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
took, 1
a, 1
whistle, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
they, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
blew, 1
it., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
door-steps., 1
"You, 1
will, 1
excuse, 1
this, 1
poor, 1
fellow,, 1
madame,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
preceded, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"but, 1
his, 1
orders, 1
are, 1
precise,, 1
and, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
begged, 1
me, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
act, 1
otherwise.", 1
In, 1
the, 1
court, 1
showing, 1
his, 1
merchandise,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tradesman, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
admitted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
precautions., 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
steps;, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
herself, 1
strongly, 1
infected, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sadness, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
magnify, 1
her, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
guided, 1
by, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
who, 1
never, 1
lost, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
her, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
introduced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
magistrate's, 1
study., 1
Preoccupied, 1
as, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
been, 1
with, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
her, 1
visit,, 1
the, 1
treatment, 1
she, 1
had, 1
received, 1
from, 1
these, 1
underlings, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
her, 1
so, 1
insulting,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
began, 1
by, 1
complaining, 1
of, 1
it., 1
But, 1
Villefort,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
bowed, 1
down, 1
by, 1
grief,, 1
looked, 1
up, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
so, 1
sad, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
that, 1
her, 1
complaints, 1
died, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
"Forgive, 1
my, 1
servants,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"for, 1
a, 1
terror, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
blame, 1
them, 1
for;, 1
from, 1
being, 1
suspected, 1
they, 1
have, 1
become, 1
suspicious.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
often, 1
heard, 1
of, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
to, 1
which, 1
the, 1
magistrate, 1
alluded,, 1
but, 1
without, 1
the, 1
evidence, 1
of, 1
her, 1
own, 1
eyesight, 1
she, 1
could, 1
never, 1
have, 1
believed, 1
that, 1
the, 1
sentiment, 1
had, 1
been, 1
carried, 1
so, 1
far., 1
"You, 1
too,, 1
then,, 1
are, 1
unhappy?", 1
she, 1
said., 1
"Yes,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
magistrate., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
pity, 1
me!", 1
"Sincerely,, 1
madame.", 1
"And, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
what, 1
brings, 1
me, 1
here?", 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
about, 1
the, 1
circumstance, 1
which, 1
has, 1
just, 1
happened?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,--a, 1
fearful, 1
misfortune.", 1
"You, 1
mean, 1
a, 1
mischance.", 1
"A, 1
mischance?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"Alas,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
with, 1
his, 1
imperturbable, 1
calmness, 1
of, 1
manner,, 1
"I, 1
consider, 1
those, 1
alone, 1
misfortunes, 1
which, 1
are, 1
irreparable.", 1
"And, 1
do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
this, 1
will, 1
be, 1
forgotten?", 1
"Everything, 1
will, 1
be, 1
forgotten,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"Your, 1
daughter, 1
will, 1
be, 1
married, 1
to-morrow,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
to-day--in, 1
a, 1
week,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
to-morrow;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
you, 1
can, 1
regret, 1
the, 1
intended, 1
husband, 1
of, 1
your, 1
daughter.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
gazed, 1
on, 1
Villefort,, 1
stupefied, 1
to, 1
find, 1
him, 1
so, 1
almost, 1
insultingly, 1
calm., 1
"Am, 1
I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
a, 1
friend?", 1
she, 1
asked, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
full, 1
of, 1
mournful, 1
dignity., 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
whose, 1
pale, 1
cheeks, 1
became, 1
slightly, 1
flushed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
her, 1
the, 1
assurance., 1
And, 1
truly, 1
this, 1
assurance, 1
carried, 1
him, 1
back, 1
to, 1
different, 1
events, 1
from, 1
those, 1
now, 1
occupying, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
and, 1
him., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
be, 1
more, 1
affectionate,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Villefort,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness., 1
"Speak, 1
to, 1
me, 1
not, 1
as, 1
a, 1
magistrate,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
bitter, 1
anguish, 1
of, 1
spirit,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
gay.", 1
Villefort, 1
bowed., 1
"When, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
misfortunes, 1
named,, 1
madame,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
within, 1
the, 1
last, 1
few, 1
months, 1
contracted, 1
the, 1
bad, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
my, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
help, 1
drawing, 1
up, 1
an, 1
egotistical, 1
parallel, 1
in, 1
my, 1
mind., 1
That, 1
is, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
that, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
my, 1
misfortunes, 1
yours, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
me, 1
mere, 1
mischances;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
why, 1
my, 1
dreadful, 1
position, 1
makes, 1
yours, 1
appear, 1
enviable., 1
But, 1
this, 1
annoys, 1
you;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
change, 1
the, 1
subject., 1
You, 1
were, 1
saying,, 1
madame"--, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"what, 1
will, 1
be, 1
done, 1
with, 1
this, 1
impostor?", 1
"Impostor,", 1
repeated, 1
Villefort;, 1
"certainly,, 1
madame,, 1
you, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
extenuate, 1
some, 1
cases,, 1
and, 1
exaggerate, 1
others., 1
Impostor,, 1
indeed!--M., 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
M., 1
Benedetto,, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
nor, 1
less, 1
than, 1
an, 1
assassin!", 1
"Sir,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
deny, 1
the, 1
justice, 1
of, 1
your, 1
correction,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
more, 1
severely, 1
you, 1
arm, 1
yourself, 1
against, 1
that, 1
unfortunate, 1
man,, 1
the, 1
more, 1
deeply, 1
will, 1
you, 1
strike, 1
our, 1
family., 1
Come,, 1
forget, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
pursuing, 1
him, 1
let, 1
him, 1
go.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
too, 1
late,, 1
madame;, 1
the, 1
orders, 1
are, 1
issued.", 1
"Well,, 1
should, 1
he, 1
be, 1
arrested--do, 1
they, 1
think, 1
they, 1
will, 1
arrest, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1
hope, 1
so.", 1
"If, 1
they, 1
should, 1
arrest, 1
him, 1
(I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
sometimes, 1
prisoners, 1
afford, 1
means, 1
of, 1
escape),, 1
will, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
him, 1
in, 1
prison?"--The, 1
procureur, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head., 1
"At, 1
least, 1
keep, 1
him, 1
there, 1
till, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
be, 1
married.", 1
"Impossible,, 1
madame;, 1
justice, 1
has, 1
its, 1
formalities.", 1
"What,, 1
even, 1
for, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
half, 1
jesting,, 1
half, 1
in, 1
earnest., 1
"For, 1
all,, 1
even, 1
for, 1
myself, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rest,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort., 1
"Ah,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
without, 1
expressing, 1
the, 1
ideas, 1
which, 1
the, 1
exclamation, 1
betrayed., 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
that, 1
piercing, 1
glance, 1
which, 1
reads, 1
the, 1
secrets, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
you, 1
mean,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"you, 1
refer, 1
to, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
rumors, 1
spread, 1
abroad, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
deaths, 1
which, 1
have, 1
kept, 1
me, 1
in, 1
mourning, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
months,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
has, 1
only, 1
escaped, 1
by, 1
a, 1
miracle,, 1
have, 1
not, 1
happened, 1
by, 1
natural, 1
means.", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
not, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
that,", 1
replied, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
quickly., 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
were, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
justice., 1
You, 1
could, 1
not, 1
help, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
yourself,, 1
'you,, 1
who, 1
pursue, 1
crime, 1
so, 1
vindictively,, 1
answer, 1
now,, 1
why, 1
are, 1
there, 1
unpunished, 1
crimes, 1
in, 1
your, 1
dwelling?'", 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
became, 1
pale., 1
"You, 1
were, 1
saying, 1
this,, 1
were, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
own, 1
it.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
you.", 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
his, 1
armchair, 1
nearer, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars;, 1
then, 1
resting, 1
both, 1
hands, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
desk, 1
he, 1
said, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
more, 1
hollow, 1
than, 1
usual:, 1
"There, 1
are, 1
crimes, 1
which, 1
remain, 1
unpunished, 1
because, 1
the, 1
criminals, 1
are, 1
unknown,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
might, 1
strike, 1
the, 1
innocent, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
the, 1
guilty;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
the, 1
culprits, 1
are, 1
discovered", 1
(Villefort, 1
here, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
toward, 1
a, 1
large, 1
crucifix, 1
placed, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
his, 1
desk)--"when, 1
they, 1
are, 1
discovered,, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
to, 1
you,, 1
by, 1
all, 1
I, 1
hold, 1
most, 1
sacred,, 1
that, 1
whoever, 1
they, 1
may, 1
be, 1
they, 1
shall, 1
die., 1
Now,, 1
after, 1
the, 1
oath, 1
I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
taken,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
I, 1
will, 1
keep,, 1
madame,, 1
dare, 1
you, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
mercy, 1
for, 1

her, 1
hands., 1
"Villefort,", 1

in, 1
her, 1
softest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
captivating, 1
manner., 1
"For, 1
heaven's, 1

Villefort,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
firmness, 1
of, 1

altogether, 1
free, 1
from, 1
harshness--"for, 1

out, 1

it, 1

joy,, 1
with, 1
triumph,--I, 1
have, 1

some, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
human, 1
perversity, 1

error., 1

us, 1

Villefort, 1
pronounced, 1
these, 1
last, 1
words, 1
with, 1
a, 1
feverish, 1
rage,, 1
which, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
ferocious, 1
eloquence, 1
to, 1
his, 1
words., 1
"But"', 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1

last, 1
effort,, 1

man,, 1

"So, 1

so, 1
much, 1

"But, 1
this, 1
is, 1

on, 1
the, 1
weak,, 1
sir.", 1
"The, 1
weakness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
murderer!", 1
"His, 1
dishonor, 1
reflects, 1
upon, 1
us.", 1
"Is, 1
not, 1
death, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house?", 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
without, 1
pity, 1
for, 1

they, 1
will, 1
have, 1
no, 1
mercy, 1
on, 1
you!", 1
"Be, 1
it, 1
so!", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
"At, 1
least,, 1
delay, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
till, 1
the, 1
next, 1
assizes;, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
then, 1
have, 1
six, 1
months, 1

"No,, 1

Villefort;, 1
"instructions, 1

Do, 1
you, 1

also, 1
long, 1

I, 1
sometimes, 1

"But,, 1

is, 1
a, 1
pardonable, 1
offence.", 1

this, 1
very, 1
minute"--, 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
"a, 1

Villefort, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
hastily, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
seal., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
trembled, 1
with, 1
fear;, 1
Villefort, 1
started, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
"Arrested!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed;, 1
"he, 1
was, 1
taken, 1
at, 1
Compiegne,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
is, 1
over.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
rose, 1
from, 1
her, 1
seat,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
cold., 1
"Adieu,, 1
sir,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
"Adieu,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney,, 1
as, 1
in, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
joyful, 1
manner, 1
he, 1
conducted, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Then,, 1
turning, 1
to, 1
his, 1
desk,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
striking, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
with, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
his, 1
right, 1
hand,, 1

had, 1
a, 1
forgery,, 1

arson,, 1

murder,, 1

here, 1
it, 1
is., 1
It, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
session!", 1
Chapter, 1
100., 1
The, 1
Apparition., 1
As, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
had, 1
told, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
recovered., 1
Bowed, 1
down, 1
with, 1
fatigue,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
confined, 1
to, 1
her, 1
bed;, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
in, 1
her, 1
own, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
all, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
events, 1
we, 1
have, 1
related,--we, 1
mean, 1
the, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
Eugenie, 1
and, 1
the, 1
arrest, 1
of, 1
Andrea, 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
Benedetto,, 1
together, 1
with, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
of, 1
murder, 1
pronounced, 1
against, 1
him., 1
But, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
so, 1
weak, 1
that, 1
this, 1
recital, 1
scarcely, 1
produced, 1
the, 1
same, 1
effect, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
done, 1
had, 1
she, 1
been, 1
in, 1
her, 1
usual, 1
state, 1
of, 1
health., 1
Indeed,, 1
her, 1
brain, 1
was, 1
only, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
of, 1
vague, 1
ideas,, 1
and, 1
confused, 1
forms,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
strange, 1
fancies,, 1
alone, 1
presented, 1
themselves, 1
before, 1
her, 1
eyes., 1
During, 1
the, 1
daytime, 1
Valentine's, 1
perceptions, 1
remained, 1
tolerably, 1
clear,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
constant, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
caused, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
be, 1
carried, 1
to, 1
his, 1
granddaughter's, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
with, 1
his, 1
paternal, 1
tenderness;, 1
Villefort, 1
also,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
return, 1
from, 1
the, 1
law, 1
courts,, 1
frequently, 1
passed, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
or, 1
two, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father, 1
and, 1
child., 1
At, 1
six, 1
o'clock, 1
Villefort, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
himself, 1
arrived,, 1
bringing, 1
the, 1
night, 1
draught, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
carried, 1
away., 1
A, 1
nurse, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor's, 1
choice, 1
succeeded, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
never, 1
left, 1
till, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
or, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock,, 1
when, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
asleep., 1
As, 1
she, 1
went, 1
down-stairs, 1
she, 1
gave, 1
the, 1
keys, 1
of, 1
Valentine's, 1
room, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
sick-room, 1
excepting, 1
through, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
little, 1
Edward., 1
Every, 1
morning, 1
Morrel, 1
called, 1
on, 1
Noirtier, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
news, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
and,, 1
extraordinary, 1
as, 1
it, 1
seemed,, 1
each, 1
day, 1
found, 1
him, 1
less, 1
uneasy., 1
Certainly,, 1
though, 1
Valentine, 1
still, 1
labored, 1
under, 1
dreadful, 1
nervous, 1
excitement,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
better;, 1
and, 1
moreover,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
told, 1
him, 1
when,, 1
half, 1
distracted,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
rushed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
house,, 1
that, 1
if, 1
she, 1
were, 1
not, 1
dead, 1
in, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
she, 1
would, 1
be, 1
saved., 1
Now, 1
four, 1
days, 1
had, 1
elapsed,, 1
and, 1
Valentine, 1
still, 1
lived., 1
The, 1
nervous, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
which, 1
we, 1
speak, 1
pursued, 1
Valentine, 1
even, 1
in, 1
her, 1
sleep,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
in, 1
that, 1
state, 1
of, 1
somnolence, 1
which, 1
succeeded, 1
her, 1
waking, 1
hours;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
night,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dim, 1
light, 1
shed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
alabaster, 1
lamp, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
shadows, 1
pass, 1
and, 1
repass, 1
which, 1
hover, 1
over, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
sickness,, 1
and, 1
fan, 1
the, 1
fever, 1
with, 1
their, 1
trembling, 1
wings., 1
First, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
her, 1
stepmother, 1
threatening, 1
her,, 1
then, 1
Morrel, 1
stretched, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
towards, 1
her;, 1
sometimes, 1
mere, 1
strangers,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
came, 1
to, 1
visit, 1
her;, 1
even, 1
the, 1
very, 1
furniture,, 1
in, 1
these, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
delirium,, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
move,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
state, 1
lasted, 1
till, 1
about, 1
three, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
when, 1
a, 1
deep,, 1
heavy, 1
slumber, 1
overcame, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
from, 1
which, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
awake, 1
till, 1
daylight., 1
On, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
on, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
of, 1
the, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
Eugenie, 1
and, 1
the, 1
arrest, 1
of, 1
Benedetto,--Villefort, 1
having, 1
retired, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
Noirtier, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny,--her, 1
thoughts, 1
wandered, 1
in, 1
a, 1
confused, 1
maze,, 1
alternately, 1
reviewing, 1
her, 1
own, 1
situation, 1
and, 1
the, 1
events, 1
she, 1
had, 1
just, 1
heard., 1
Eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
had, 1
struck., 1
The, 1
nurse,, 1
having, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
beverage, 1
prepared, 1
by, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
within, 1
reach, 1
of, 1
the, 1
patient,, 1
and, 1
locked, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
was, 1
listening, 1
with, 1
terror, 1
to, 1
the, 1
comments, 1
of, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
in, 1
the, 1
kitchen,, 1
and, 1
storing, 1
her, 1
memory, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
horrible, 1
stories, 1
which, 1
had, 1
for, 1
some, 1
months, 1
past, 1
amused, 1
the, 1
occupants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ante-chambers, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney., 1
Meanwhile, 1
an, 1
unexpected, 1
scene, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
carefully, 1
locked., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
had, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
the, 1
nurse, 1
had, 1
left;, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
hour, 1
had, 1
been, 1
suffering, 1
from, 1
the, 1
fever, 1
which, 1
returned, 1
nightly,, 1
incapable, 1
of, 1
controlling, 1
her, 1
ideas,, 1
was, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
which, 1
exhausted, 1
itself, 1
in, 1
producing, 1
and, 1
reproducing, 1
a, 1
succession, 1
and, 1
recurrence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
fancies, 1
and, 1
images., 1
The, 1
night-lamp, 1
threw, 1
out, 1
countless, 1
rays,, 1
each, 1
resolving, 1
itself, 1
into, 1
some, 1
strange, 1
form, 1
to, 1
her, 1
disordered, 1
imagination,, 1
when, 1
suddenly, 1
by, 1
its, 1
flickering, 1
light, 1
Valentine, 1
thought, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
her, 1
library,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
recess, 1
by, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece,, 1
open, 1
slowly,, 1
though, 1
she, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
listened, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hinges, 1
on, 1
which, 1
it, 1
turned., 1
At, 1
any, 1
other, 1
time, 1
Valentine, 1
would, 1
have, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
silken, 1
bell-pull, 1
and, 1
summoned, 1
assistance,, 1
but, 1
nothing, 1
astonished, 1
her, 1
in, 1
her, 1
present, 1
situation., 1
Her, 1
reason, 1
told, 1
her, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
visions, 1
she, 1
beheld, 1
were, 1
but, 1
the, 1
children, 1
of, 1
her, 1
imagination,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
conviction, 1
was, 1
strengthened, 1
by, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
no, 1
traces, 1
remained, 1
of, 1
the, 1
nocturnal, 1
phantoms,, 1
who, 1
disappeared, 1
with, 1
the, 1
coming, 1
of, 1
daylight., 1
From, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
door, 1
a, 1
human, 1
figure, 1
appeared,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
girl, 1
was, 1
too, 1
familiar, 1
with, 1
such, 1
apparitions, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
only, 1
stared,, 1
hoping, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
figure, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
listen, 1
with, 1
profound, 1
attention., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
glanced, 1
across, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
the, 1
midnight, 1
visitor., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
he,", 1
she, 1
murmured,, 1
and, 1
waited,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
assurance, 1
that, 1
this, 1
was, 1
but, 1
a, 1
dream,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
man, 1
to, 1
disappear, 1
or, 1
assume, 1
some, 1
other, 1
form., 1
Still,, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
her, 1
pulse,, 1
and, 1
finding, 1
it, 1
throb, 1
violently, 1
she, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
best, 1
method, 1
of, 1
dispelling, 1
such, 1
illusions, 1
was, 1
to, 1
drink,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
draught, 1
of, 1
the, 1
beverage, 1
prepared, 1
by, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
to, 1
allay, 1
her, 1
fever, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
cause, 1
a, 1
reaction, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brain,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
she, 1
suffered, 1
less., 1
Valentine, 1
therefore, 1
reached, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
her, 1
trembling, 1
arm, 1
left, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
the, 1
apparition, 1
advanced, 1
more, 1
quickly, 1
towards, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
so, 1
closely, 1
that, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
his, 1
breath,, 1
and, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
pressure, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
This, 1
time, 1
the, 1
illusion,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
reality,, 1
surpassed, 1
anything, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
before, 1
experienced;, 1
she, 1
began, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
herself, 1
really, 1
alive, 1
and, 1
awake,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
belief, 1
that, 1
her, 1
reason, 1
was, 1
this, 1
time, 1
not, 1
deceived, 1
made, 1
her, 1
shudder., 1
The, 1
pressure, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
arrest, 1
her, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
slowly, 1
withdrew, 1
it., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
figure,, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
she, 1
could, 1
not, 1
detach, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
more, 1
protecting, 1
than, 1
menacing,, 1
took, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
walking, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
night-light, 1
held, 1
it, 1
up,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
to, 1
test, 1
its, 1
transparency., 1
This, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seem, 1
sufficient;, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
the, 1
ghost--for, 1
he, 1
trod, 1
so, 1
softly, 1
that, 1
no, 1
sound, 1
was, 1
heard--then, 1
poured, 1
out, 1
about, 1
a, 1
spoonful, 1
into, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
drank, 1
it., 1
Valentine, 1
witnessed, 1
this, 1
scene, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sentiment, 1
of, 1
stupefaction., 1
Every, 1
minute, 1
she, 1
had, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
it, 1
would, 1
vanish, 1
and, 1
give, 1
place, 1
to, 1
another, 1
vision;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
dissolving, 1
like, 1
a, 1
shadow,, 1
again, 1
approached, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
in, 1
an, 1
agitated, 1
voice,, 1
"Now, 1
you, 1
may, 1
drink.", 1
Valentine, 1
shuddered., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these, 1
visions, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
addressed, 1
her, 1
in, 1
a, 1
living, 1
voice,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
an, 1
exclamation., 1
The, 1
man, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
on, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo!", 1
she, 1
murmured., 1
It, 1
was, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
now, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
mind, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reality, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scene;, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
started, 1
with, 1
terror,, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
trembled,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
rapidly, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
bedclothes, 1
closer, 1
to, 1
her., 1
Still,, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
at, 1
such, 1
an, 1
hour,, 1
his, 1
mysterious,, 1
fanciful,, 1
and, 1
extraordinary, 1
entrance, 1
into, 1
her, 1
room, 1
through, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
might, 1
well, 1
seem, 1
impossibilities, 1
to, 1
her, 1
shattered, 1
reason., 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
call, 1
any, 1
one--do, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
Count;, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
a, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
suspicion, 1
or, 1
uneasiness, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
your, 1
breast;, 1
the, 1
man, 1
standing, 1
before, 1
you,, 1
Valentine, 1
(for, 1
this, 1
time, 1
it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
ghost),, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
the, 1
tenderest, 1
father, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1
respectful, 1
friend, 1
you, 1
could, 1
dream, 1
of.", 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
not, 1
reply;, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
indicated, 1
the, 1
real, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
a, 1
being, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
alarmed, 1
her, 1
so, 1
much, 1
that, 1
she, 1
feared, 1
to, 1
utter, 1
a, 1
syllable;, 1
still, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
inquire,, 1
"If, 1
your, 1
intentions, 1
are, 1
pure,, 1
why, 1
are, 1
you, 1
here?", 1
The, 1
count's, 1
marvellous, 1
sagacity, 1
understood, 1
all, 1
that, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
mind., 1
"Listen, 1
to, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"or,, 1
rather,, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
me;, 1
look, 1
at, 1
my, 1
face,, 1
paler, 1
even, 1
than, 1
usual,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
eyes,, 1
red, 1
with, 1
weariness--for, 1
four, 1
days, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
closed, 1
them,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
constantly, 1
watching, 1
you,, 1
to, 1
protect, 1
and, 1
preserve, 1
you, 1
for, 1
Maximilian.", 1
The, 1
blood, 1
mounted, 1
rapidly, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cheeks, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
name, 1
just, 1
announced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
dispelled, 1
all, 1
the, 1
fear, 1
with, 1
which, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
had, 1
inspired, 1
her., 1
"Maximilian!", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
sweet, 1
did, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
that, 1
she, 1
repeated, 1
it--"Maximilian!--has, 1
he, 1
then, 1
owned, 1
all, 1
to, 1
you?", 1
"Everything., 1
He, 1
told, 1
me, 1
your, 1
life, 1
was, 1
his,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
him, 1
that, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
live.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
promised, 1
him, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
live?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"But,, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
of, 1
vigilance, 1
and, 1
protection., 1
Are, 1
you, 1
a, 1
doctor?", 1
"Yes;, 1
the, 1
best, 1
you, 1
could, 1
have, 1
at, 1
the, 1
present, 1
time,, 1
believe, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
you, 1
say, 1
you, 1
have, 1
watched?", 1
said, 1
Valentine, 1
uneasily;, 1
"where, 1
have, 1
you, 1
been?--I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
you.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
library., 1
"I, 1
was, 1
hidden, 1
behind, 1
that, 1
door,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"which, 1
leads, 1
into, 1
the, 1
next, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
rented.", 1
Valentine, 1
turned, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
away,, 1
and,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
indignant, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
pride, 1
and, 1
modest, 1
fear,, 1
exclaimed:, 1
"Sir,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
have, 1
been, 1
guilty, 1
of, 1
an, 1
unparalleled, 1
intrusion,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
what, 1
you, 1
call, 1
protection, 1
is, 1
more, 1
like, 1
an, 1
insult.", 1
"Valentine,", 1
he, 1
answered,, 1
"during, 1
my, 1
long, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
you,, 1
all, 1
I, 1
have, 1
observed, 1
has, 1
been, 1
what, 1
people, 1
visited, 1
you,, 1
what, 1
nourishment, 1
was, 1
prepared,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
beverage, 1
was, 1
served;, 1
then,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
appeared, 1
dangerous, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
entered,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
have, 1
now, 1
done,, 1
and, 1
substituted,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
place, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poison,, 1
a, 1
healthful, 1
draught;, 1
which,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
producing, 1
the, 1
death, 1
intended,, 1
caused, 1
life, 1
to, 1
circulate, 1
in, 1
your, 1
veins.", 1
"Poison--death!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Valentine,, 1
half, 1
believing, 1
herself, 1
under, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
some, 1
feverish, 1
hallucination;, 1
"what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
saying,, 1
sir?", 1
"Hush,, 1
my, 1
child,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
again, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
lips,, 1
"I, 1
did, 1
say, 1
poison, 1
and, 1
death., 1
But, 1
drink, 1
some, 1
of, 1
this;", 1
and, 1
the, 1
count, 1
took, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
containing, 1
a, 1
red, 1
liquid,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
poured, 1
a, 1
few, 1
drops, 1
into, 1
the, 1
glass., 1
"Drink, 1
this,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
take, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to-night.", 1
Valentine, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
but, 1
scarcely, 1
had, 1
she, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
when, 1
she, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
in, 1
fear., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
took, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
drank, 1
half, 1
its, 1
contents,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
presented, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
smiled, 1
and, 1
swallowed, 1
the, 1
rest., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"I, 1
recognize, 1
the, 1
flavor, 1
of, 1
my, 1
nocturnal, 1
beverage, 1
which, 1
refreshed, 1
me, 1
so, 1
much,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
ease, 1
my, 1
aching, 1
brain., 1
Thank, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
thank, 1
you!", 1
"This, 1
is, 1
how, 1
you, 1
have, 1
lived, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
nights,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"But,, 1
oh,, 1
how, 1
I, 1
passed, 1
that, 1
time!, 1
Oh,, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
hours, 1
I, 1
have, 1
endured--the, 1
torture, 1
to, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
submitted, 1
when, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
deadly, 1
poison, 1
poured, 1
into, 1
your, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
how, 1
I, 1
trembled, 1
lest, 1
you, 1
should, 1
drink, 1
it, 1
before, 1
I, 1
could, 1
find, 1
time, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
it, 1
away!", 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
height, 1
of, 1
her, 1
terror,, 1
"you, 1
say, 1
you, 1
endured, 1
tortures, 1
when, 1
you, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
deadly, 1
poison, 1
poured, 1
into, 1
my, 1
glass;, 1

if, 1
you, 1
saw, 1
this,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
also, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
poured, 1
it?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Valentine, 1
raised, 1
herself, 1
in, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
over, 1
her, 1
chest,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
whiter, 1
than, 1
snow,, 1
the, 1
embroidered, 1
cambric,, 1
still, 1
moist, 1
with, 1
the, 1
cold, 1
dews, 1
of, 1
delirium,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
were, 1
now, 1
added, 1
those, 1
of, 1
terror., 1
"You, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
person?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
"Yes,", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"What, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
is, 1
horrible,, 1
sir., 1
You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
make, 1
me, 1
believe, 1
something, 1
too, 1
dreadful., 1
What?--attempt, 1
to, 1
murder, 1
me, 1
in, 1
my, 1
father's, 1
house,, 1
in, 1
my, 1
room,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
sickness?, 1
Oh,, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1
sir;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
tempting, 1
me--you, 1
make, 1
me, 1
doubt, 1
the, 1
goodness, 1
of, 1
providence--it, 1
is, 1
impossible,, 1
it, 1
cannot, 1
be!", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
the, 1
first, 1
that, 1
this, 1
hand, 1
has, 1
stricken?, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
Barrois,, 1
all, 1
fall?, 1
Would, 1
not, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
also, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
a, 1
victim,, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
treatment, 1
he, 1
has, 1
been, 1
pursuing, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
years, 1
neutralized, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poison?", 1
"Oh,, 1
heaven,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"is, 1
this, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
grandpapa, 1
has, 1
made, 1
me, 1
share, 1
all, 1
his, 1
beverages, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
month?", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
they, 1
all, 1
tasted, 1
of, 1
a, 1
slightly, 1
bitter, 1
flavor,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
dried, 1
orange-peel?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes!", 1
"Then, 1
that, 1
explains, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Your, 1
grandfather, 1
knows,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
a, 1
poisoner, 1
lives, 1
here;, 1
perhaps, 1
he, 1
even, 1
suspects, 1
the, 1
person., 1
He, 1
has, 1
been, 1
fortifying, 1
you,, 1
his, 1
beloved, 1
child,, 1
against, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poison,, 1
which, 1
has, 1
failed, 1
because, 1
your, 1
system, 1
was, 1
already, 1
impregnated, 1
with, 1
it., 1
But, 1
even, 1
this, 1
would, 1
have, 1
availed, 1
little, 1
against, 1
a, 1
more, 1
deadly, 1
medium, 1
of, 1
death, 1
employed, 1
four, 1
days, 1
ago,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
but, 1
too, 1
fatal.", 1
"But, 1
who,, 1
then,, 1
is, 1
this, 1
assassin,, 1
this, 1
murderer?", 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
also, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
a, 1
question., 1
Have, 1
you, 1
never, 1
seen, 1
any, 1
one, 1
enter, 1
your, 1
room, 1
at, 1
night?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
frequently, 1
seen, 1
shadows, 1
pass, 1
close, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
approach,, 1
and, 1
disappear;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
took, 1
them, 1
for, 1
visions, 1
raised, 1
by, 1
my, 1
feverish, 1
imagination,, 1
and, 1
indeed, 1
when, 1
you, 1
entered, 1
I, 1
thought, 1
I, 1
was, 1
under, 1
the, 1
influence, 1
of, 1
delirium.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
who, 1
it, 1
is, 1
that, 1
attempts, 1
your, 1
life?", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"who, 1
could, 1
desire, 1
my, 1
death?", 1
"You, 1
shall, 1
know, 1
it, 1
now,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
listening., 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
looking, 1
anxiously, 1
around., 1
"Because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
feverish, 1
or, 1
delirious, 1
to-night,, 1
but, 1
thoroughly, 1
awake;, 1
midnight, 1
is, 1
striking,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
murderers, 1
choose.", 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Valentine,, 1
wiping, 1
off, 1
the, 1
drops, 1
which, 1
ran, 1
down, 1
her, 1
forehead., 1
Midnight, 1
struck, 1
slowly, 1
and, 1
sadly;, 1
every, 1
hour, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
strike, 1
with, 1
leaden, 1
weight, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
girl., 1
"Valentine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"summon, 1
up, 1
all, 1
your, 1
courage;, 1
still, 1
the, 1
beatings, 1
of, 1
your, 1
heart;, 1
do, 1
not, 1
let, 1
a, 1
sound, 1
escape, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
feign, 1
to, 1
be, 1
asleep;, 1
then, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see.", 1
Valentine, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand., 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
hear, 1
a, 1
noise,", 1
she, 1
said;, 1
"leave, 1
me.", 1
"Good-by,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
present,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
walking, 1
upon, 1
tiptoe, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
library, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
smiling, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
so, 1
sad, 1
and, 1
paternal, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
gratitude., 1
Before, 1
closing, 1
the, 1
door, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
around, 1
once, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"Not, 1
a, 1
movement--not, 1
a, 1
word;, 1
let, 1
them, 1
think, 1
you, 1
asleep,, 1
or, 1
perhaps, 1
you, 1
may, 1
be, 1
killed, 1
before, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
helping, 1
you.", 1
And, 1
with, 1
this, 1
fearful, 1
injunction, 1
the, 1
count, 1
disappeared, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
noiselessly, 1
closed, 1
after, 1
him., 1
Chapter, 1
101., 1
Locusta., 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
alone;, 1
two, 1
other, 1
clocks,, 1
slower, 1
than, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Saint-Philippe, 1
du, 1
Roule,, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
midnight, 1
from, 1
different, 1
directions,, 1
and, 1
excepting, 1
the, 1
rumbling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
few, 1
carriages, 1
all, 1
was, 1
silent., 1
Then, 1
Valentine's, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
engrossed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
in, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
which, 1
marked, 1
the, 1
seconds., 1
She, 1
began, 1
counting, 1
them,, 1
remarking, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
much, 1
slower, 1
than, 1
the, 1
beatings, 1
of, 1
her, 1
heart;, 1
and, 1
still, 1
she, 1
doubted,--the, 1
inoffensive, 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
not, 1
imagine, 1
that, 1
any, 1
one, 1
should, 1
desire, 1
her, 1
death., 1
Why, 1
should, 1
they?, 1
To, 1
what, 1
end?, 1
What, 1
had, 1
she, 1
done, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
the, 1
malice, 1
of, 1
an, 1
enemy?, 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
fear, 1
of, 1
her, 1
falling, 1
asleep., 1
One, 1
terrible, 1
idea, 1
pressed, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
mind,--that, 1
some, 1
one, 1
existed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
who, 1
had, 1
attempted, 1
to, 1
assassinate, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so, 1
again., 1
Supposing, 1
this, 1
person,, 1
wearied, 1
at, 1
the, 1
inefficacy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poison,, 1
should,, 1
as, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
intimated,, 1
have, 1
recourse, 1
to, 1
steel!--What, 1
if, 1
the, 1
count, 1
should, 1
have, 1
no, 1
time, 1
to, 1
run, 1
to, 1
her, 1
rescue!--What, 1
if, 1
her, 1
last, 1
moments, 1
were, 1
approaching,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
should, 1
never, 1
again, 1
see, 1
Morrel!, 1
When, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
chain, 1
of, 1
ideas, 1
presented, 1
itself,, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
persuaded, 1
to, 1
ring, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
and, 1
call, 1
for, 1
help., 1
But, 1
through, 1
the, 1
door, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
luminous, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count--that, 1
eye, 1
which, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
her, 1
memory,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
recollection, 1
overwhelmed, 1
her, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
shame, 1
that, 1
she, 1
asked, 1
herself, 1
whether, 1
any, 1
amount, 1
of, 1
gratitude, 1
could, 1
ever, 1
repay, 1
his, 1
adventurous, 1
and, 1
devoted, 1
friendship., 1
Twenty, 1
minutes,, 1
twenty, 1
tedious, 1
minutes,, 1
passed, 1
thus,, 1
then, 1
ten, 1
more,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
last, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
half-hour., 1
Just, 1
then, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
finger-nails, 1
slightly, 1
grating, 1
against, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
library, 1
informed, 1
Valentine, 1
that, 1
the, 1
count, 1
was, 1
still, 1
watching,, 1
and, 1
recommended, 1
her, 1
to, 1
do, 1
the, 1
same;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
opposite, 1
side,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
towards, 1
Edward's, 1
room,, 1
Valentine, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
she, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
creaking, 1
of, 1
the, 1
floor;, 1
she, 1
listened, 1
attentively,, 1
holding, 1
her, 1
breath, 1
till, 1
she, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
suffocated;, 1
the, 1
lock, 1
turned,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door, 1
slowly, 1
opened., 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
herself, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
elbow,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
time, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
herself, 1
down, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
shade, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
her, 1
arm;, 1
then,, 1
trembling,, 1
agitated,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
heart, 1
beating, 1
with, 1
indescribable, 1
terror,, 1
she, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
event., 1
Some, 1
one, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
the, 1
curtains., 1
Valentine, 1
summoned, 1
every, 1
effort,, 1
and, 1
breathed, 1
with, 1
that, 1
regular, 1
respiration, 1
which, 1
announces, 1
tranquil, 1
sleep., 1
"Valentine!", 1
said, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice., 1
Still, 1
silent:, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
not, 1
to, 1
awake., 1
Then, 1
everything, 1
was, 1
still,, 1
excepting, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
almost, 1
noiseless, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
some, 1
liquid, 1
being, 1
poured, 1
into, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
she, 1
had, 1
just, 1
emptied., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
open, 1
her, 1
eyelids,, 1
and, 1
glance, 1
over, 1
her, 1
extended, 1
arm., 1
She, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
in, 1
a, 1
white, 1
dressing-gown, 1
pouring, 1
a, 1
liquor, 1
from, 1
a, 1
phial, 1
into, 1
her, 1
glass., 1
During, 1
this, 1
short, 1
time, 1
Valentine, 1
must, 1
have, 1
held, 1
her, 1
breath,, 1
or, 1
moved, 1
in, 1
some, 1
slight, 1
degree,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
woman,, 1
disturbed,, 1
stopped, 1
and, 1
leaned, 1
over, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
the, 1
better, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
whether, 1
Valentine, 1
slept--it, 1
was, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
On, 1
recognizing, 1
her, 1
step-mother,, 1
Valentine, 1
could, 1
not, 1
repress, 1
a, 1
shudder,, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
a, 1
vibration, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
instantly, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
there,, 1
shaded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
bed-curtains,, 1
she, 1
silently, 1
and, 1
attentively, 1
watched, 1
the, 1
slightest, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
Valentine., 1
The, 1
latter, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
caution, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
she, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
not, 1
holding, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
clasped, 1
a, 1
long, 1
sharp, 1
knife., 1
Then, 1
collecting, 1
all, 1
her, 1
remaining, 1
strength,, 1
she, 1
forced, 1
herself, 1
to, 1
close, 1
her, 1
eyes;, 1
but, 1
this, 1
simple, 1
operation, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
most, 1
delicate, 1
organs, 1
of, 1
our, 1
frame,, 1
generally, 1
so, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
accomplish,, 1
became, 1
almost, 1
impossible, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
did, 1
curiosity, 1
struggle, 1
to, 1
retain, 1
the, 1
eyelid, 1
open, 1
and, 1
learn, 1
the, 1
truth., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
however,, 1
reassured, 1
by, 1
the, 1
silence,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
regular, 1
breathing, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
again, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
half, 1
hidden, 1
by, 1
the, 1
curtains, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
emptying, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
the, 1
phial, 1
into, 1
the, 1
glass., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
retired, 1
so, 1
gently, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
did, 1
not, 1
know, 1
she, 1
had, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
She, 1
only, 1
witnessed, 1
the, 1
withdrawal, 1
of, 1
the, 1
arm--the, 1
fair, 1
round, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
but, 1
twenty-five, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
yet, 1
spread, 1
death, 1
around, 1
her., 1
It, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
describe, 1
the, 1
sensations, 1
experienced, 1
by, 1
Valentine, 1
during, 1
the, 1
minute, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room., 1
The, 1
grating, 1
against, 1
the, 1
library-door, 1
aroused, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
from, 1
the, 1
stupor, 1
in, 1
which, 1
she, 1
was, 1
plunged,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
almost, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
insensibility., 1
She, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head, 1
with, 1
an, 1
effort., 1
The, 1
noiseless, 1
door, 1
again, 1
turned, 1
on, 1
its, 1
hinges,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
reappeared., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
doubt?", 1
"Oh,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
seen?", 1
"Alas!", 1
"Did, 1
you, 1
recognize?", 1
Valentine, 1
groaned., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"I, 1
saw,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
believe!", 1
"Would, 1
you, 1
rather, 1
die,, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
cause, 1
Maximilian's, 1
death?", 1
"Oh,", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
almost, 1
bewildered,, 1
"can, 1
I, 1
not, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
house?--can, 1
I, 1
not, 1
escape?", 1
"Valentine,, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
which, 1
now, 1
threatens, 1
you, 1
will, 1
pursue, 1
you, 1
everywhere;, 1
your, 1
servants, 1
will, 1
be, 1
seduced, 1
with, 1
gold,, 1
and, 1
death, 1
will, 1
be, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
you, 1
disguised, 1
in, 1
every, 1
shape., 1
You, 1
will, 1
find, 1
it, 1
in, 1
the, 1
water, 1
you, 1
drink, 1
from, 1
the, 1
spring,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fruit, 1
you, 1
pluck, 1
from, 1
the, 1

it, 1
to, 1

Valentine, 1
in, 1
the, 1
extremity, 1
of, 1

terror, 1
joined, 1
her, 1
hands,--for, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
had, 1
arrived, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
courage,--and, 1
began, 1
to, 1

while, 1
uttering, 1
little, 1
more, 1
than, 1
incoherent, 1
words,, 1

white, 1

no, 1
other, 1
covering, 1
than, 1
her, 1
long, 1
hair,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
pulsations, 1
of, 1
her, 1
heart, 1
could, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
through, 1
the, 1
lace, 1
of, 1
her, 1
nightdress., 1

Cristo, 1
gently, 1
laid, 1

hand, 1
on, 1

young, 1
girl's, 1
arm,, 1
drew, 1
the, 1
velvet, 1
coverlet, 1
close, 1
to, 1
her, 1
throat,, 1

with, 1
a, 1
paternal, 1
smile,--"My, 1

he, 1
drew, 1
from, 1

waistcoat-pocket, 1
the, 1
little, 1
emerald, 1
box,, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
golden, 1
lid,, 1

took, 1
from, 1
it, 1
a, 1
pastille, 1
about, 1
the, 1
size, 1
of, 1
a, 1
pea,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
She, 1
took, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
attentively, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
there, 1
was, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
on, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
her, 1
intrepid, 1
protector, 1
which, 1
commanded, 1
her, 1
veneration., 1
She, 1
evidently, 1
interrogated, 1
him, 1
by, 1
her, 1
look., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
he., 1
Valentine, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
pastille, 1
to, 1
her, 1
mouth,, 1
and, 1
swallowed, 1
it., 1
"And, 1

little, 1
sleep,, 1
for, 1

saved.", 1
"Go,", 1
said, 1
Valentine,, 1
"whatever, 1
happens,, 1

you, 1
not, 1
to, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl,, 1
who, 1
gradually, 1
fell, 1
asleep,, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
the, 1
narcotic, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
given, 1
her., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
took, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
emptied, 1
three, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fireplace,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
might, 1

had, 1
taken, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
replaced, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
disappeared,, 1
after, 1
throwing, 1
a, 1
farewell, 1
glance, 1
on, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
slept, 1
with, 1
the, 1
confidence, 1

innocence, 1
of, 1

angel., 1

102., 1
Valentine., 1
The, 1
night-light, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
burn, 1
on, 1
the, 1
chimney-piece,, 1
exhausting, 1
the, 1
last, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
oil, 1
which, 1
floated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
of, 1
the, 1
water., 1
The, 1
globe, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
appeared, 1
of, 1
a, 1
reddish, 1
hue,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
flame,, 1
brightening, 1
before, 1
it, 1
expired,, 1
threw, 1
out, 1
the, 1
last, 1
flickerings, 1
which, 1
in, 1
an, 1
inanimate, 1
object, 1
have, 1
been, 1
so, 1
often, 1
compared, 1
with, 1
the, 1
convulsions, 1
of, 1
a, 1
human, 1
creature, 1
in, 1
its, 1
final, 1
agonies., 1
A, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
dismal, 1
light, 1
was, 1
shed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
bedclothes, 1
and, 1
curtains, 1
surrounding, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
All, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
the, 1
streets, 1
had, 1
ceased,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
was, 1
frightful., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
that, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
Edward's, 1
room, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
head, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
noticed, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
opposite;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
came, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
effects, 1
of, 1
the, 1
drink, 1
she, 1
had, 1
prepared., 1
She, 1
stopped, 1
in, 1
the, 1
doorway,, 1
listened, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
the, 1
flickering, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamp,, 1
the, 1
only, 1
sound, 1
in, 1
that, 1
deserted, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
table, 1
to, 1
see, 1
if, 1
Valentine's, 1
glass, 1
were, 1
empty., 1
It, 1
was, 1
still, 1
about, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
full,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
before, 1
stated., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
emptied, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
into, 1
the, 1
ashes,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
disturbed, 1
that, 1
they, 1
might, 1
the, 1
more, 1
readily, 1
absorb, 1
the, 1
liquid;, 1
then, 1
she, 1
carefully, 1
rinsed, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
wiping, 1
it, 1
with, 1
her, 1
handkerchief, 1
replaced, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
If, 1
any, 1
one, 1
could, 1
have, 1
looked, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room, 1
just, 1
then, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
hesitation, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
fixedly, 1
on, 1
Valentine., 1
The, 1
dim, 1
light,, 1
the, 1
profound, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
thoughts, 1
inspired, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hour,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
by, 1
her, 1
own, 1
conscience,, 1
all, 1
combined, 1
to, 1
produce, 1
a, 1
sensation, 1
of, 1
fear;, 1
the, 1
poisoner, 1
was, 1
terrified, 1
at, 1
the, 1
contemplation, 1
of, 1
her, 1
own, 1
work., 1
At, 1
length, 1
she, 1
rallied,, 1
drew, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
curtain,, 1
and, 1
leaning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
pillow, 1
gazed, 1
intently, 1
on, 1
Valentine., 1
The, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
breathed,, 1
no, 1
breath, 1
issued, 1
through, 1
the, 1
half-closed, 1
teeth;, 1
the, 1
white, 1
lips, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
quivered--the, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
suffused, 1
with, 1
a, 1
bluish, 1
vapor,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
long, 1
black, 1
lashes, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
a, 1
cheek, 1
white, 1
as, 1

Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
gazed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
face, 1
so, 1
expressive, 1
even, 1
in, 1
its, 1
stillness;, 1
then, 1
she, 1
ventured, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
the, 1
coverlet, 1
and, 1
press, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
heart., 1
It, 1
was, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
motionless., 1
She, 1
only, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
pulsation, 1
in, 1
her, 1
own, 1
fingers,, 1
and, 1
withdrew, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
a, 1
shudder., 1
One, 1
arm, 1
was, 1
hanging, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed;, 1
from, 1
shoulder, 1
to, 1
elbow, 1
it, 1
was, 1
moulded, 1
after, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
Germain, 1
Pillon's, 1
"Graces,", 1
[*], 1
but, 1
the, 1
fore-arm, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
slightly, 1
distorted, 1
by, 1
convulsion,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
hand,, 1
so, 1
delicately, 1
formed,, 1
was, 1
resting, 1
with, 1
stiff, 1
outstretched, 1
fingers, 1
on, 1
the, 1
framework, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
The, 1
nails,, 1
too,, 1
were, 1
turning, 1
blue., 1
*, 1
Germain, 1
Pillon, 1
was, 1
a, 1
famous, 1
French, 1
sculptor, 1
(1535-1598)., 1
His, 1
best, 1
known, 1
work, 1
is, 1
"The, 1
Three, 1
Graces,", 1
now, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Louvre., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
doubt;, 1
all, 1
was, 1
over--she, 1
had, 1
consummated, 1
the, 1
last, 1
terrible, 1
work, 1
she, 1
had, 1
to, 1
accomplish., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
so, 1
the, 1
poisoner, 1
retired, 1
stealthily,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
fearing, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
her, 1
own, 1
footsteps;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
she, 1
withdrew, 1
she, 1
still, 1
held, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
curtain,, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
irresistible, 1
attraction, 1
always, 1
exerted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
picture, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
it, 1
is, 1
merely, 1
mysterious, 1
and, 1
does, 1
not, 1
excite, 1
disgust., 1
Just, 1
then, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
again, 1
flickered;, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
startled, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
shuddered, 1
and, 1
dropped, 1
the, 1
curtain., 1
Immediately, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
light, 1
expired,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
room, 1
was, 1
plunged, 1
in, 1
frightful, 1
obscurity,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
clock, 1
at, 1
that, 1
minute, 1
struck, 1
half-past, 1
four., 1
Overpowered, 1
with, 1
agitation,, 1
the, 1
poisoner, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
groping, 1
her, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
reached, 1
her, 1
room, 1
in, 1
an, 1
agony, 1
of, 1
fear., 1
The, 1
darkness, 1
lasted, 1
two, 1
hours, 1
longer;, 1
then, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
light, 1
crept, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Venetian, 1
blinds,, 1
until, 1
at, 1
length, 1
it, 1
revealed, 1
the, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room., 1
About, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
nurse's, 1
cough, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
and, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
with, 1
a, 1
cup, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand., 1
To, 1
the, 1
tender, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
or, 1
a, 1
lover,, 1
the, 1
first, 1
glance, 1
would, 1
have, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
reveal, 1
Valentine's, 1
condition;, 1
but, 1
to, 1
this, 1
hireling,, 1
Valentine, 1
only, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
sleep., 1
"Good,", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
"she, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
part, 1
of, 1
her, 1
draught;, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
is, 1
three-quarters, 1
empty.", 1
Then, 1
she, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
fireplace, 1
and, 1
lit, 1
the, 1
fire,, 1
and, 1
although, 1
she, 1
had, 1
just, 1
left, 1
her, 1
bed,, 1
she, 1
could, 1
not, 1
resist, 1
the, 1
temptation, 1
offered, 1
by, 1
Valentine's, 1
sleep,, 1
so, 1
she, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
an, 1
arm-chair, 1
to, 1
snatch, 1
a, 1
little, 1
more, 1
rest., 1
The, 1
clock, 1
striking, 1
eight, 1
awoke, 1
her., 1
Astonished, 1
at, 1
the, 1
prolonged, 1
slumber, 1
of, 1
the, 1
patient,, 1
and, 1
frightened, 1
to, 1
see, 1
that, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
was, 1
still, 1
hanging, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
she, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
white, 1
lips., 1
She, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
replace, 1
the, 1
arm,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
moved, 1
with, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
rigidity, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
deceive, 1
a, 1
sick-nurse., 1
She, 1
screamed, 1
aloud;, 1
then, 1
running, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
exclaimed,--"Help,, 1
help!", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
asked, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
it, 1
being, 1
the, 1
hour, 1
he, 1
usually, 1
visited, 1
her., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort,, 1
rushing, 1
from, 1
his, 1
room., 1
"Doctor,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
them, 1
call, 1
for, 1
help?", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
hasten, 1
up;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
in, 1
Valentine's, 1
room.", 1
But, 1
before, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
the, 1
father, 1
could, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
who, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
floor, 1
had, 1
entered,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
Valentine, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
on, 1
her, 1
bed,, 1
they, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
their, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
heaven, 1
and, 1
stood, 1
transfixed,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
struck, 1
by, 1
lightening., 1
"Call, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort!--Wake, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort!", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
from, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
chamber,, 1
which, 1
apparently, 1
he, 1
scarcely, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
leave., 1
But, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
obeying, 1
him,, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
stood, 1
watching, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
who, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms., 1
"What?--this, 1
one,, 1
too?", 1
he, 1
exclaimed., 1
"Oh,, 1
where, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
end?", 1
Villefort, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
saying,, 1
doctor?", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
"I, 1
say, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
is, 1
dead!", 1
replied, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
terrible, 1
in, 1
its, 1
solemn, 1
calm., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
staggered, 1
and, 1
buried, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
On, 1
the, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
the, 1
father,, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
all, 1
fled, 1
with, 1
muttered, 1
imprecations;, 1
they, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
running, 1
down, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
and, 1
through, 1
the, 1
long, 1
passages,, 1
then, 1
there, 1
was, 1
a, 1
rush, 1
in, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
afterwards, 1
all, 1
was, 1
still;, 1
they, 1
had,, 1
one, 1
and, 1
all,, 1
deserted, 1
the, 1
accursed, 1
house., 1
Just, 1
then,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
act, 1
of, 1
slipping, 1
on, 1
her, 1
dressing-gown,, 1
threw, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
drapery, 1
and, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
stood, 1
motionless,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
interrogating, 1
the, 1
occupants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
while, 1
she, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
call, 1
up, 1
some, 1
rebellious, 1
tears., 1
On, 1
a, 1
sudden, 1
she, 1
stepped,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
bounded,, 1
with, 1
outstretched, 1
arms,, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
table., 1
She, 1
saw, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
curiously, 1
examining, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
which, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
certain, 1
of, 1
having, 1
emptied, 1
during, 1
the, 1
night., 1
It, 1
was, 1
now, 1
a, 1
third, 1
full,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
when, 1
she, 1
threw, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
into, 1
the, 1
ashes., 1
The, 1
spectre, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
rising, 1
before, 1
the, 1
poisoner, 1
would, 1
have, 1
alarmed, 1
her, 1
less., 1
It, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
the, 1
same, 1
color, 1
as, 1
the, 1
draught, 1
she, 1
had, 1
poured, 1
into, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
drunk};, 1
it, 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
the, 1
poison,, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
deceive, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
now, 1
examined, 1
so, 1
closely;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
doubtless, 1
a, 1
miracle, 1
from, 1
heaven,, 1
that,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
her, 1
precautions,, 1
there, 1
should, 1
be, 1
some, 1
trace,, 1
some, 1
proof, 1
remaining, 1
to, 1
reveal, 1
the, 1
crime., 1
While, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
remained, 1
rooted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
like, 1
a, 1
statue, 1
of, 1
terror,, 1
and, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
head, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
the, 1
bedclothes,, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
the, 1
better, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
contents, 1
of, 1
the, 1
glass,, 1
and, 1
dipping, 1
the, 1
tip, 1
of, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
in,, 1
tasted, 1
it., 1
"Ah,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
brucine, 1
that, 1
is, 1
used;, 1
let, 1
me, 1
see, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is!", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cupboards, 1
in, 1
Valentine's, 1
room,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
transformed, 1
into, 1
a, 1
medicine, 1
closet,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
from, 1
its, 1
silver, 1
case, 1
a, 1
small, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
nitric, 1
acid,, 1
dropped, 1
a, 1
little, 1
of, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
liquor,, 1
which, 1
immediately, 1
changed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
blood-red, 1
color., 1
"Ah,", 1
exclaimed, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
horror, 1
of, 1
a, 1
judge, 1
unveiling, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
was, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
of, 1
a, 1
student, 1
making, 1
a, 1
discovery., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
overpowered,, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
first, 1
flashed, 1
and, 1
then, 1
swam,, 1
she, 1
staggered, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
Directly, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
distant, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
weight, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
paid, 1
any, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
it;, 1
the, 1
nurse, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
chemical, 1
analysis,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
still, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
grief., 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
alone, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
hurried, 1
retreat., 1
He, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
the, 1
drapery, 1
over, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
to, 1
Edward's, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
reaching, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
apartment,, 1
he, 1
beheld, 1
her, 1
extended, 1
lifeless, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
"Go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
assistance, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
nurse., 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
ill.", 1
"But, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort"--stammered, 1
the, 1
nurse., 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
requires, 1
help,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"since, 1
she, 1
is, 1
dead.", 1
"Dead,--dead!", 1
groaned, 1
forth, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
grief,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
more, 1
terrible, 1
from, 1
the, 1
novelty, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
in, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
that, 1
man., 1
"Dead!", 1
repeated, 1
a, 1
third, 1
voice., 1
"Who, 1
said, 1
Valentine, 1
was, 1
dead?", 1
The, 1
two, 1
men, 1
turned, 1
round,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
Morrel, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
terror-stricken., 1
This, 1
is, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
At, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
time,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
little, 1
door, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
Noirtier's, 1
room., 1
Contrary, 1
to, 1
custom,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
ring, 1
he, 1
entered., 1
He, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
and, 1
called, 1
for, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
him, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Noirtier;, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
answered,, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
having,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
know,, 1
deserted, 1
the, 1
house., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
no, 1
particular, 1
reason, 1
for, 1
uneasiness;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
promised, 1
him, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
should, 1
live,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
far, 1
he, 1
had, 1
always, 1
fulfilled, 1
his, 1
word., 1
Every, 1
night, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
given, 1
him, 1
news,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
the, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
confirmed, 1
by, 1
Noirtier., 1
Still, 1
this, 1
extraordinary, 1
silence, 1
appeared, 1
strange, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
called, 1
a, 1
second, 1
and, 1
third, 1
time;, 1
still, 1
no, 1
answer., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
go, 1
up., 1
Noirtier's, 1
room, 1
was, 1
opened,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest., 1
The, 1
first, 1
thing, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
was, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
sitting, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arm-chair, 1
in, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
place,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
expressed, 1
alarm,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
confirmed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
pallor, 1
which, 1
overspread, 1
his, 1
features., 1
"How, 1
are, 1
you,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sickness, 1
of, 1
heart., 1
"Well,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
by, 1
closing, 1
his, 1
eyes;, 1
but, 1
his, 1
appearance, 1
manifested, 1
increasing, 1
uneasiness., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
thoughtful,, 1
sir,", 1
continued, 1
Morrel;, 1
"you, 1
want, 1
something;, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
call, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
servants?", 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Noirtier., 1
Morrel, 1
pulled, 1
the, 1
bell,, 1
but, 1
though, 1
he, 1
nearly, 1
broke, 1
the, 1
cord, 1
no, 1
one, 1
answered., 1
He, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
Noirtier;, 1
the, 1
pallor, 1
and, 1
anguish, 1
expressed, 1
on, 1
his, 1
countenance, 1
momentarily, 1
increased., 1
"Oh,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel,, 1
"why, 1
do, 1
they, 1
not, 1
come?, 1
Is, 1
any, 1
one, 1
ill, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house?", 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
would, 1
start, 1
from, 1
their, 1
sockets., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
You, 1
alarm, 1
me., 1
Valentine?, 1
Valentine?", 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
signed, 1
Noirtier., 1
Maximilian, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
could, 1
articulate, 1
nothing;, 1
he, 1
staggered,, 1
and, 1
supported, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wainscot., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,, 1
yes!", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
Maximilian, 1
rushed, 1
up, 1
the, 1
little, 1
staircase,, 1
while, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,--"Quicker,, 1
quicker!", 1
In, 1
a, 1
minute, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
darted, 1
through, 1
several, 1
rooms,, 1
till, 1
at, 1
length, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
Valentine's., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
push, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
wide, 1
open., 1
A, 1
sob, 1
was, 1
the, 1
only, 1
sound, 1
he, 1
heard., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
as, 1
though, 1
in, 1
a, 1
mist,, 1
a, 1
black, 1
figure, 1
kneeling, 1
and, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
a, 1
confused, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
white, 1
drapery., 1
A, 1
terrible, 1
fear, 1
transfixed, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
exclaim, 1
"Valentine, 1
is, 1
dead!", 1
and, 1
another, 1
voice, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
an, 1
echo, 1
repeated,--"Dead,--dead!", 1
Chapter, 1
103., 1
Maximilian., 1
Villefort, 1
rose,, 1
half, 1
ashamed, 1
of, 1
being, 1
surprised, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
grief., 1
The, 1
terrible, 1
office, 1
he, 1
had, 1
held, 1
for, 1
twenty-five, 1
years, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
making, 1
him, 1
more, 1
or, 1
less, 1
than, 1
man., 1
His, 1
glance,, 1
at, 1
first, 1
wandering,, 1
fixed, 1
itself, 1
upon, 1
Morrel., 1
"Who, 1
are, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
asked,, 1
"that, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
a, 1
house, 1
stricken, 1
with, 1
death?, 1
Go,, 1
sir,, 1
go!", 1
But, 1
Morrel, 1
remained, 1
motionless;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
detach, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
from, 1
that, 1
disordered, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
corpse, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
who, 1
was, 1
lying, 1
on, 1
it., 1
"Go!--do, 1
you, 1
hear?", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
while, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
lead, 1
Morrel, 1
out., 1
Maximilian, 1
stared, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
gazed, 1
all, 1
around, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
then, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
two, 1
men;, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
finding, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
give, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
innumerable, 1
ideas, 1
that, 1
occupied, 1
his, 1
brain,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
thrusting, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
through, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
diverted, 1
from, 1
the, 1
engrossing, 1
topic,, 1
exchanged, 1
glances,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,--"He, 1
is, 1
mad!", 1
But, 1
in, 1
less, 1
than, 1
five, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
groaned, 1
beneath, 1
an, 1
extraordinary, 1
weight., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
carrying,, 1
with, 1
superhuman, 1
strength,, 1
the, 1
arm-chair, 1
containing, 1
Noirtier, 1
up-stairs., 1
When, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
landing, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
arm-chair, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
and, 1
rapidly, 1
rolled, 1
it, 1
into, 1
Valentine's, 1
room., 1
This, 1
could, 1
only, 1
have, 1
been, 1
accomplished, 1
by, 1
means, 1
of, 1
unnatural, 1
strength, 1
supplied, 1
by, 1
powerful, 1
excitement., 1
But, 1
the, 1
most, 1
fearful, 1
spectacle, 1
was, 1
Noirtier, 1
being, 1
pushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
his, 1
face, 1
expressing, 1
all, 1
his, 1
meaning,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
supplying, 1
the, 1
want, 1
of, 1
every, 1
other, 1
faculty., 1
That, 1
pale, 1
face, 1
and, 1
flaming, 1
glance, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
Villefort, 1
like, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
apparition., 1
Each, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
brought, 1
into, 1
contact, 1
with, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
something, 1
terrible, 1
had, 1
happened., 1
"See, 1
what, 1
they, 1
have, 1
done!", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
extended, 1
towards, 1
Valentine., 1
"See,, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
see!", 1
Villefort, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who,, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
called, 1
Noirtier, 1
his, 1
father., 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
soul, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
seemed, 1
centred, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
which, 1
became, 1
bloodshot;, 1
the, 1
veins, 1
of, 1
the, 1
throat, 1
swelled;, 1
his, 1
cheeks, 1
and, 1
temples, 1
became, 1
purple,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
was, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
epilepsy;, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
wanting, 1
to, 1
complete, 1
this, 1
but, 1
the, 1
utterance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cry., 1
And, 1
the, 1
cry, 1
issued, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pores,, 1
if, 1
we, 1
may, 1
thus, 1
speak--a, 1
cry, 1
frightful, 1
in, 1
its, 1
silence., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
and, 1
made, 1
him, 1
inhale, 1
a, 1
powerful, 1
restorative., 1
"Sir,", 1
cried, 1
Morrel,, 1
seizing, 1
the, 1
moist, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
paralytic,, 1
"they, 1
ask, 1
me, 1
who, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
and, 1
what, 1
right, 1
I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
be, 1
here., 1
Oh,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
tell, 1
them,, 1
tell, 1
them!", 1
And, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
choked, 1
by, 1
sobs., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
his, 1
chest, 1
heaved, 1
with, 1
his, 1
panting, 1
respiration., 1
One, 1
could, 1
have, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
undergoing, 1
the, 1
agonies, 1
preceding, 1
death., 1
At, 1
length,, 1
happier, 1
than, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
sobbed, 1
without, 1
weeping,, 1
tears, 1
glistened, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Tell, 1
them,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice,, 1
"tell, 1
them, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
her, 1
betrothed., 1
Tell, 1
them, 1
she, 1
was, 1
my, 1
beloved,, 1
my, 1
noble, 1
girl,, 1
my, 1
only, 1
blessing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
Tell, 1
them--oh,, 1
tell, 1
them,, 1
that, 1
corpse, 1
belongs, 1
to, 1
me!", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
overwhelmed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
anguish,, 1
fell, 1
heavily, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
before, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
grasped, 1
with, 1
convulsive, 1
energy., 1
D'Avrigny,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
this, 1
touching, 1
emotion,, 1
turned, 1
away;, 1
and, 1
Villefort,, 1
without, 1
seeking, 1
any, 1
further, 1
explanation,, 1
and, 1
attracted, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
by, 1
the, 1
irresistible, 1
magnetism, 1
which, 1
draws, 1
us, 1
towards, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
loved, 1
the, 1
people, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
mourn,, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
But, 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1
nothing;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
weep, 1
vented, 1
his, 1
agony, 1
in, 1
groans, 1
as, 1
he, 1
bit, 1
the, 1
sheets., 1
For, 1
some, 1
time, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
that, 1
chamber, 1
but, 1
sobs,, 1
exclamations,, 1
and, 1
prayers., 1
At, 1
length, 1
Villefort,, 1
the, 1
most, 1
composed, 1
of, 1
all,, 1
spoke:, 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
he, 1
to, 1
Maximilian,, 1
"you, 1
say, 1
you, 1
loved, 1
Valentine,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
were, 1
betrothed, 1
to, 1
her., 1
I, 1
knew, 1
nothing, 1
of, 1
this, 1
engagement,, 1
of, 1
this, 1
love,, 1
yet, 1
I,, 1
her, 1
father,, 1
forgive, 1
you,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
see, 1
that, 1
your, 1
grief, 1
is, 1
real, 1
and, 1
deep;, 1
and, 1
besides, 1
my, 1
own, 1
sorrow, 1
is, 1
too, 1
great, 1
for, 1
anger, 1
to, 1
find, 1
a, 1
place, 1
in, 1
my, 1
heart., 1
But, 1
you, 1
see, 1
that, 1
the, 1
angel, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
hoped, 1
for, 1
has, 1
left, 1
this, 1
earth--she, 1
has, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
with, 1
the, 1
adoration, 1
of, 1
men., 1
Take, 1
a, 1
last, 1
farewell,, 1
sir,, 1
of, 1
her, 1
sad, 1
remains;, 1
take, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
you, 1
expected, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
once, 1
more, 1
within, 1
your, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
separate, 1
yourself, 1
from, 1
her, 1
forever., 1
Valentine, 1
now, 1
requires, 1
only, 1
the, 1
ministrations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
priest.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
mistaken,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel,, 1
raising, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
one, 1
knee,, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
pierced, 1
by, 1
a, 1
more, 1
acute, 1
pang, 1
than, 1
any, 1
he, 1
had, 1
yet, 1
felt--"you, 1
are, 1
mistaken;, 1
Valentine,, 1
dying, 1
as, 1
she, 1
has,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
requires, 1
a, 1
priest,, 1
but, 1
an, 1
avenger., 1
You,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
send, 1
for, 1
the, 1
priest;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
be, 1
the, 1
avenger.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean,, 1
sir?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort,, 1
trembling, 1
at, 1
the, 1
new, 1
idea, 1
inspired, 1
by, 1
the, 1
delirium, 1
of, 1
Morrel., 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
two, 1
persons, 1
exist, 1
in, 1
you;, 1
the, 1
father, 1
has, 1
mourned, 1
sufficiently,, 1
now, 1
let, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
fulfil, 1
his, 1
office.", 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
glistened,, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
approached., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
reading, 1
all, 1
that, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
minds, 1
of, 1
the, 1
witnesses, 1
to, 1
the, 1
scene,, 1
"I, 1
know, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
saying,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
know, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
say--Valentine, 1
has, 1
been, 1
assassinated!", 1
Villefort, 1
hung, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
approached, 1
nearer,, 1
and, 1
Noirtier, 1
said, 1
"Yes", 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"Now,, 1
sir,", 1
continued, 1
Morrel,, 1
"in, 1
these, 1
days, 1
no, 1
one, 1
can, 1
disappear, 1
by, 1
violent, 1
means, 1
without, 1
some, 1
inquiries, 1
being, 1
made, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
her, 1
disappearance,, 1
even, 1
were, 1
she, 1
not, 1
a, 1
young,, 1
beautiful,, 1
and, 1
adorable, 1
creature, 1
like, 1
Valentine., 1
Mr., 1
Procureur,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
increasing, 1
vehemence,, 1
"no, 1
mercy, 1
is, 1
allowed;, 1
I, 1
denounce, 1
the, 1
crime;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
your, 1
place, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
the, 1
assassin.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
implacable, 1
eyes, 1
interrogated, 1
Villefort,, 1
who,, 1
on, 1
his, 1
side,, 1
glanced, 1
from, 1
Noirtier, 1
to, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
But, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
sympathy, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
he, 1
only, 1
saw, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
as, 1
inflexible, 1
as, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Yes,", 1
indicated, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Assuredly,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
striving, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
against, 1
this, 1
triple, 1
force, 1
and, 1
his, 1
own, 1
emotion,--"sir,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
deceived;, 1
no, 1
one, 1
commits, 1
crimes, 1
here., 1
I, 1
am, 1
stricken, 1
by, 1
fate., 1
It, 1
is, 1
horrible,, 1
indeed,, 1
but, 1
no, 1
one, 1
assassinates.", 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
Noirtier, 1
lighted, 1
up, 1
with, 1
rage,, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
speak., 1
Morrel,, 1
however,, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
commanded, 1
silence., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
say, 1
that, 1
murders, 1
are, 1
committed, 1
here,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
whose, 1
voice,, 1
though, 1
lower, 1
in, 1
tone,, 1
lost, 1
none, 1
of, 1
its, 1
terrible, 1
distinctness:, 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
fourth, 1
victim, 1
within, 1
the, 1
last, 1
four, 1
months., 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
Valentine's, 1
life, 1
was, 1
attempted, 1
by, 1
poison, 1
four, 1
days, 1
ago,, 1
though, 1
she, 1
escaped,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
precautions, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier., 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
the, 1
dose, 1
has, 1
been, 1
double,, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
changed,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
this, 1
time, 1
it, 1
has, 1
succeeded., 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
know, 1
these, 1
things, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do,, 1
since, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
has, 1
forewarned, 1
you,, 1
both, 1
as, 1
a, 1
doctor, 1
and, 1
as, 1
a, 1
friend.", 1
"Oh,, 1
you, 1
rave,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
the, 1
net, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
taken., 1
"I, 1
rave?", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"well,, 1
then,, 1
I, 1
appeal, 1
to, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
himself., 1
Ask, 1
him,, 1
sir,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
recollects, 1
the, 1
words, 1
he, 1
uttered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden, 1

house, 1
on, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran's, 1
death., 1
You, 1
thought, 1
yourselves, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
talked, 1
about, 1
that, 1
tragical, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fatality, 1
you, 1
mentioned, 1
then, 1
is, 1
the, 1
same, 1
which, 1
has, 1
caused, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
of, 1
Valentine.", 1
Villefort, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
exchanged, 1
looks., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
continued, 1
Morrel;, 1
"recall, 1
the, 1
scene,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
words, 1
you, 1
thought, 1
were, 1
only, 1
given, 1
to, 1
silence, 1
and, 1
solitude, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
my, 1
ears., 1
Certainly,, 1
after, 1
witnessing, 1
the, 1
culpable, 1
indolence, 1
manifested, 1
by, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
towards, 1
his, 1
own, 1
relations,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
denounced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
authorities;, 1
then, 1
I, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
been, 1
an, 1
accomplice, 1
to, 1
thy, 1
death,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
now, 1
am,, 1
sweet,, 1
beloved, 1
Valentine;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
accomplice, 1
shall, 1
become, 1
the, 1
avenger., 1
This, 1
fourth, 1
murder, 1
is, 1
apparent, 1
to, 1
all,, 1

if, 1
thy, 1
father, 1
abandon, 1
thee,, 1
Valentine,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
I,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
swear, 1
it,, 1
that, 1
shall, 1
pursue, 1
the, 1
assassin.", 1
And, 1
this, 1
time,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
nature, 1
had, 1
at, 1
least, 1
taken, 1
compassion, 1
on, 1
the, 1
vigorous, 1
frame,, 1
nearly, 1
bursting, 1
with, 1
its, 1
own, 1
strength,, 1
the, 1
words, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
were, 1
stifled, 1
in, 1
his, 1
throat;, 1
his, 1
breast, 1
heaved;, 1
the, 1
tears,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
rebellious,, 1
gushed, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
weeping, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed., 1
Then, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
spoke., 1
"And, 1
I,, 1
too,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
"I, 1
unite, 1
with, 1
M., 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
demanding, 1
justice, 1
for, 1
crime;, 1
my, 1
blood, 1
boils, 1
at, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
having, 1
encouraged, 1
a, 1
murderer, 1
by, 1
my, 1
cowardly, 1
concession.", 1
"Oh,, 1
merciful, 1
heavens!", 1
murmured, 1
Villefort., 1
Morrel, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
reading, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
which, 1
gleamed, 1
with, 1
unnatural, 1
lustre,--"Stay,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"M., 1
Noirtier, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
speak.", 1
"Yes,", 1
indicated, 1
Noirtier,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
the, 1
more, 1
terrible,, 1
from, 1
all, 1
his, 1
faculties, 1
being, 1
centred, 1
in, 1
his, 1
glance., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
assassin?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Noirtier., 1
"And, 1
will, 1
you, 1
direct, 1
us?", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"Listen,, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
listen!", 1
Noirtier, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
melancholy, 1
smiles, 1
which, 1
had, 1
so, 1
often, 1
made, 1
Valentine, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
thus, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
attention., 1
Then,, 1
having, 1
riveted, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
his, 1
interlocutor, 1
on, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
he, 1
glanced, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
leave?", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
sadly., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Noirtier., 1
"Alas,, 1
alas,, 1
sir,, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
on, 1
me!", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
remained, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"May, 1
I,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
return?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Yes.", 1
"Must, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
alone?", 1
"No.", 1
"Whom, 1
am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
take, 1
with, 1
me?, 1
The, 1
procureur?", 1
"No.", 1
"The, 1
doctor?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"But, 1
can, 1
he, 1
understand, 1
you?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
inexpressibly, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inquiries, 1
were, 1
to, 1
be, 1
made, 1
by, 1
him, 1
alone,--"oh,, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
took, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
arm,, 1
and, 1
led, 1
him, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room., 1
A, 1
more, 1
than, 1
deathlike, 1
silence, 1
then, 1
reigned, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
a, 1
faltering, 1
footstep, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
where, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
been, 1
staying,, 1
one, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
meditation,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
in, 1
grief., 1
"You, 1
can, 1
come,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
and, 1
led, 1
them, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Noirtier., 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
attentively, 1
on, 1
Villefort., 1
His, 1
face, 1
was, 1
livid,, 1
large, 1
drops, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
his, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
he, 1
held, 1
the, 1
fragments, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quill, 1
pen, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
torn, 1
to, 1
atoms., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice,, 1
"give, 1
me, 1
your, 1
word, 1
of, 1
honor, 1
that, 1
this, 1
horrible, 1
secret, 1
shall, 1
forever, 1
remain, 1
buried, 1
amongst, 1
ourselves!", 1
The, 1
two, 1
men, 1
drew, 1
back., 1
"I, 1
entreat, 1
you."--continued, 1
Villefort., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"the, 1
culprit--the, 1
murderer--the, 1
assassin.", 1
"Do, 1
not, 1
alarm, 1
yourself,, 1
sir;, 1
justice, 1
will, 1
be, 1
done,", 1
said, 1
Villefort., 1
"My, 1
father, 1
has, 1
revealed, 1
the, 1
culprit's, 1
name;, 1
my, 1
father, 1
thirsts, 1
for, 1
revenge, 1
as, 1
much, 1
as, 1
you, 1
do,, 1
yet, 1
even, 1
he, 1
conjures, 1
you, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
this, 1
secret., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
father?", 1
"Yes,", 1
resolutely, 1
replied, 1
Noirtier., 1
Morrel, 1
suffered, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
horror, 1
and, 1
surprise, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
him., 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
arresting, 1
Maximilian, 1
by, 1
the, 1
arm,, 1
"if, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
the, 1
inflexible, 1
man,, 1
makes, 1
this, 1
request,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
because, 1
he, 1
knows,, 1
be, 1
assured,, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
will, 1
be, 1
terribly, 1
revenged., 1
Is, 1
it, 1
not, 1
so,, 1
father?", 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative., 1
Villefort, 1
continued:, 1
"He, 1
knows, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
pledged, 1
my, 1
word, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Rest, 1
assured,, 1
gentlemen,, 1
that, 1
within, 1
three, 1
days,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
less, 1
time, 1
than, 1
justice, 1
would, 1
demand,, 1
the, 1
revenge, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
of, 1
my, 1
child, 1
will, 1
be, 1
such, 1
as, 1
to, 1
make, 1
the, 1
boldest, 1
heart, 1
tremble;", 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
these, 1
words, 1
he, 1
ground, 1
his, 1
teeth,, 1
and, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
senseless, 1
hand., 1
"Will, 1
this, 1
promise, 1
be, 1
fulfilled,, 1
M., 1
Noirtier?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
while, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
looked, 1
inquiringly., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
Noirtier, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
sinister, 1
joy., 1
"Swear,, 1
then,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
joining, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"swear, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
spare, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
to, 1
avenge, 1
my, 1
child.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
turned, 1
round, 1
and, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
very, 1
feeble, 1
"Yes,", 1
but, 1
Morrel,, 1
disengaging, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
rushed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
cold, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
hurriedly, 1
left,, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
long,, 1
deep, 1
groan, 1
of, 1
despair, 1
and, 1
anguish., 1
We, 1
have, 1
before, 1
stated, 1
that, 1
all, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
had, 1
fled., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
request, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
to, 1
superintend, 1
all, 1
the, 1
arrangements, 1
consequent, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
death, 1
in, 1
a, 1
large, 1
city,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
a, 1
death, 1
under, 1
such, 1
suspicious, 1
circumstances., 1
It, 1
was, 1
something, 1
terrible, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
silent, 1
agony,, 1
the, 1
mute, 1
despair, 1
of, 1
Noirtier,, 1
whose, 1
tears, 1
silently, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
his, 1
cheeks., 1
Villefort, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
and, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
left, 1
to, 1
summon, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
mayoralty,, 1
whose, 1
office, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
examine, 1
bodies, 1
after, 1
decease,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
is, 1
expressly, 1
named, 1
"the, 1
doctor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead.", 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
persuaded, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
his, 1
grandchild., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
his, 1
associate;, 1
they, 1
found, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
gate, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
remaining, 1
in, 1
the, 1
house;, 1
Villefort, 1
himself, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
open, 1
to, 1
them., 1
But, 1
he, 1
stopped, 1
on, 1
the, 1
landing;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
again, 1
visit, 1
the, 1
death, 1
chamber., 1
The, 1
two, 1
doctors,, 1
therefore,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room, 1
alone., 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
near, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
pale,, 1
motionless,, 1
and, 1
silent, 1
as, 1
the, 1
corpse., 1
The, 1
district, 1
doctor, 1
approached, 1
with, 1
the, 1
indifference, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
half, 1
his, 1
time, 1
amongst, 1
the, 1
dead;, 1
he, 1
then, 1
lifted, 1
the, 1
sheet, 1
which, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
face,, 1
and, 1
just, 1
unclosed, 1
the, 1
lips., 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
"she, 1
is, 1
indeed, 1
dead,, 1
poor, 1
child!", 1
"Yes,", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
laconically,, 1
dropping, 1
the, 1
sheet, 1
he, 1
had, 1
raised., 1
Noirtier, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
hoarse,, 1
rattling, 1
sound;, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eyes, 1
sparkled,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
good, 1
doctor, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
his, 1
child., 1
He, 1
therefore, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
while, 1
his, 1
companion, 1
was, 1
dipping, 1
the, 1
fingers, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
in, 1
chloride, 1
of, 1
lime,, 1
he, 1
uncovered, 1
the, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
pale, 1
face,, 1
which, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sleeping, 1
angel., 1
A, 1
tear,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
eye,, 1
expressed, 1
his, 1
thanks, 1
to, 1
the, 1
doctor., 1
The, 1
doctor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead, 1
then, 1
laid, 1
his, 1
permit, 1
on, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
fulfilled, 1
his, 1
duty,, 1
was, 1
conducted, 1
out, 1
by, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
Villefort, 1
met, 1
them, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
his, 1
study;, 1
having, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
thanked, 1
the, 1
district, 1
doctor,, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
and, 1
said,--"And, 1
now, 1
the, 1
priest.", 1
"Is, 1
there, 1
any, 1
particular, 1
priest, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
pray, 1
with, 1
Valentine?", 1
asked, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"No.", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"fetch, 1
the, 1
nearest.", 1
"The, 1
nearest,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
district, 1
doctor,, 1
"is, 1
a, 1
good, 1
Italian, 1
abbe,, 1
who, 1
lives, 1
next, 1
door, 1
to, 1
you., 1
Shall, 1
I, 1
call, 1
on, 1
him, 1
as, 1
I, 1
pass?", 1
"D'Avrigny,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"be, 1
so, 1
kind,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
this, 1
gentleman., 1
Here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
key, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
you, 1
can, 1
go, 1
in, 1
and, 1
out, 1
as, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
with, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
will, 1
oblige, 1
me, 1
by, 1
introducing, 1
him, 1
into, 1
my, 1
child's, 1
room.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
see, 1
him?", 1
"I, 1
only, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
alone., 1
You, 1
will, 1
excuse, 1
me,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not?, 1
A, 1
priest, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
a, 1
father's, 1
grief.", 1
And, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
giving, 1
the, 1
key, 1
to, 1
d'Avrigny,, 1
again, 1
bade, 1
farewell, 1
to, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
doctor,, 1
and, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
work., 1
For, 1
some, 1
temperaments, 1
work, 1
is, 1
a, 1
remedy, 1
for, 1
all, 1
afflictions., 1
As, 1
the, 1
doctors, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cassock, 1
standing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
next, 1
door., 1
"This, 1
is, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
I, 1
spoke,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
to, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
accosted, 1
the, 1
priest., 1
"Sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
disposed, 1
to, 1
confer, 1
a, 1
great, 1
obligation, 1
on, 1
an, 1
unhappy, 1
father, 1
who, 1
has, 1
just, 1
lost, 1
his, 1
daughter?, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
marked, 1
Italian, 1
accent;, 1
"yes,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
heard, 1
that, 1
death, 1
is, 1
in, 1
that, 1
house.", 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
need, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
what, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
service, 1
he, 1
requires, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
myself,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
priest;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
our, 1
mission, 1
to, 1
forestall, 1
our, 1
duties.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it,, 1
sir;, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
who, 1
fled, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
informed, 1
me., 1
I, 1
also, 1
know, 1
that, 1
her, 1
name, 1
is, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
prayed, 1
for, 1
her.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny;, 1
"since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
commenced, 1
your, 1
sacred, 1
office,, 1
deign, 1
to, 1
continue, 1
it., 1
Come, 1
and, 1
watch, 1
by, 1
the, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
the, 1
wretched, 1
family, 1
will, 1
be, 1
grateful, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
going,, 1
sir;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
hesitate, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
no, 1
prayers, 1
will, 1
be, 1
more, 1
fervent, 1
than, 1
mine.", 1
D'Avrigny, 1
took, 1
the, 1
priest's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
meeting, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
Valentine's, 1
room,, 1
which, 1
on, 1
the, 1
following, 1
night, 1
was, 1
to, 1
be, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
the, 1
undertakers., 1
On, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
Noirtier's, 1
eyes, 1
met, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
he, 1
read, 1
some, 1
particular, 1
expression, 1
in, 1
them,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
remained, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
recommended, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
of, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
to, 1
the, 1
living, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
dead,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
devote, 1
his, 1
prayers, 1
to, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
his, 1
attentions, 1
to, 1
Noirtier., 1
In, 1
order,, 1
doubtless,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
disturbed, 1
while, 1
fulfilling, 1
his, 1
sacred, 1
mission,, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
rose, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
departed,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
only, 1
bolted, 1
the, 1
door, 1
through, 1
which, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
had, 1
just, 1
left,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
that, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
room., 1
Chapter, 1
104., 1
Danglars, 1
Signature., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
dawned, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
cloudy., 1
During, 1
the, 1
night, 1
the, 1
undertakers, 1
had, 1
executed, 1
their, 1
melancholy, 1
office,, 1
and, 1
wrapped, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
in, 1
the, 1
winding-sheet,, 1
which,, 1
whatever, 1
may, 1
be, 1
said, 1
about, 1
the, 1
equality, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
is, 1
at, 1
least, 1
a, 1
last, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
the, 1
luxury, 1
so, 1
pleasing, 1
in, 1
life., 1
This, 1
winding-sheet, 1
was, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
beautiful, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
cambric,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
had, 1
bought, 1
a, 1
fortnight, 1
before., 1
During, 1
the, 1
evening, 1
two, 1
men,, 1
engaged, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose,, 1
had, 1
carried, 1
Noirtier, 1
from, 1
Valentine's, 1
room, 1
into, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
contrary, 1
to, 1
all, 1
expectation, 1
there, 1
was, 1
no, 1
difficulty, 1
in, 1
withdrawing, 1
him, 1
from, 1
his, 1
child., 1
The, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
till, 1
daylight,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
left, 1
without, 1
calling, 1
any, 1
one., 1
D'Avrigny, 1
returned, 1
about, 1
eight, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning;, 1
he, 1
met, 1
Villefort, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way, 1
to, 1
Noirtier's, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
to, 1
see, 1
how, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
had, 1
slept., 1
They, 1
found, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
large, 1
arm-chair,, 1
which, 1
served, 1
him, 1
for, 1
a, 1
bed,, 1
enjoying, 1
a, 1
calm,, 1
nay,, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
smiling, 1
sleep., 1
They, 1
both, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
amazement, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"See,", 1
said, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
to, 1
Villefort,, 1
"nature, 1
knows, 1
how, 1
to, 1
alleviate, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
sorrow., 1
No, 1
one, 1
can, 1
say, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
did, 1
not, 1
love, 1
his, 1
child,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
sleeps.", 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
right,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort,, 1
surprised;, 1
"he, 1
sleeps,, 1
indeed!, 1
And, 1
this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
more, 1
strange,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
least, 1
contradiction, 1
keeps, 1
him, 1
awake, 1
all, 1
night.", 1
"Grief, 1
has, 1
stunned, 1
him,", 1
replied, 1
d'Avrigny;, 1
and, 1
they, 1
both, 1
returned, 1
thoughtfully, 1
to, 1
the, 1
procureur's, 1
study., 1
"See,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
slept,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
showing, 1
his, 1
undisturbed, 1
bed;, 1
"grief, 1
does, 1
not, 1
stun, 1
me., 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
been, 1
in, 1
bed, 1
for, 1
two, 1
nights;, 1
but, 1
then, 1
look, 1
at, 1
my, 1
desk;, 1
see, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
written, 1
during, 1
these, 1
two, 1
days, 1
and, 1
nights., 1
I, 1
have, 1
filled, 1
those, 1
papers,, 1
and, 1
have, 1
made, 1
out, 1
the, 1
accusation, 1
against, 1
the, 1
assassin, 1
Benedetto., 1
Oh,, 1
work,, 1
work,--my, 1
passion,, 1
my, 1
joy,, 1
my, 1
delight,--it, 1
is, 1
for, 1
thee, 1
to, 1
alleviate, 1
my, 1
sorrows!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
convulsively, 1
grasped, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
require, 1
my, 1
services, 1
now?", 1
asked, 1
d'Avrigny., 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Villefort;, 1
"only, 1
return, 1
again, 1
at, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock;, 1
at, 1
twelve, 1
the--the--oh,, 1
heavens,, 1
my, 1
poor,, 1
poor, 1
child!", 1
and, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
again, 1
becoming, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
groaned., 1
"Shall, 1
you, 1
be, 1
present, 1
in, 1
the, 1
reception, 1
room?", 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
cousin, 1
who, 1
has, 1
undertaken, 1
this, 1
sad, 1
office., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
work,, 1
doctor--when, 1
I, 1
work, 1
I, 1
forget, 1
everything.", 1
And,, 1
indeed,, 1
no, 1
sooner, 1
had, 1
the, 1
doctor, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
than, 1
he, 1
was, 1
again, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
study., 1
On, 1
the, 1
doorsteps, 1
d'Avrigny, 1
met, 1
the, 1
cousin, 1
whom, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
mentioned,, 1
a, 1
personage, 1
as, 1
insignificant, 1
in, 1
our, 1
story, 1
as, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world, 1
he, 1
occupied--one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
beings, 1
designed, 1
from, 1
their, 1
birth, 1
to, 1
make, 1
themselves, 1
useful, 1
to, 1
others., 1
He, 1
was, 1
punctual,, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
black,, 1
with, 1
crape, 1
around, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1
and, 1
presented, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
his, 1
cousin's, 1
with, 1
a, 1
face, 1
made, 1
up, 1
for, 1
the, 1
occasion,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
he, 1
could, 1
alter, 1
as, 1
might, 1
be, 1
required., 1
At, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock, 1
the, 1
mourning-coaches, 1
rolled, 1
into, 1
the, 1
paved, 1
court,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
du, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore, 1
was, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
of, 1
idlers,, 1
equally, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
festivities, 1
or, 1
the, 1
mourning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
rush, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
avidity, 1
to, 1
a, 1
funeral, 1
procession, 1
as, 1
to, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
a, 1
duchess., 1
Gradually, 1
the, 1
reception-room, 1
filled,, 1
and, 1
some, 1
of, 1
our, 1
old, 1
friends, 1
made, 1
their, 1
appearance--we, 1
mean, 1
Debray,, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
all, 1
the, 1
leading, 1
men, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bar,, 1
in, 1
literature,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
army,, 1
for, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
moved, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
Parisian, 1
circles,, 1
less, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
his, 1
social, 1
position, 1
than, 1
to, 1
his, 1
personal, 1
merit., 1
The, 1
cousin, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
ushered, 1
in, 1
the, 1
guests,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
relief, 1
to, 1
the, 1
indifferent, 1
to, 1
see, 1
a, 1
person, 1
as, 1
unmoved, 1
as, 1
themselves,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
did, 1
not, 1
exact, 1
a, 1
mournful, 1
face, 1
or, 1
force, 1
tears,, 1
as, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
case, 1
with, 1
a, 1
father,, 1
a, 1
brother,, 1
or, 1
a, 1
lover., 1
Those, 1
who, 1
were, 1
acquainted, 1
soon, 1
formed, 1
into, 1
little, 1
groups., 1
One, 1
of, 1
them, 1
was, 1
made, 1
of, 1
Debray,, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Poor, 1
girl,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
paying, 1
an, 1
involuntary, 1
tribute, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sad, 1
event,--"poor, 1
girl,, 1
so, 1
young,, 1
so, 1
rich,, 1
so, 1
beautiful!, 1
Could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
imagined, 1
this, 1
scene,, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
when, 1
we, 1
saw, 1
her,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
most, 1
three, 1
weeks, 1
ago,, 1
about, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
that, 1
contract?", 1
"Indeed,, 1
no,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud--"Did, 1
you, 1
know, 1
her?", 1
"I, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
her, 1
once, 1
or, 1
twice, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's,, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rest;, 1
she, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
me, 1
charming,, 1
though, 1

Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"Dr., 1
d'Avrigny,, 1

"I, 1
am, 1
seeking, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1

on, 1

"His, 1
banker?, 1

his, 1
banker,, 1
is, 1

asked, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
of, 1
Debray., 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
so,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
secretary, 1
with, 1
slight, 1
uneasiness., 1
"But, 1
Monte, 1

"Morrel?, 1
Do, 1

him?", 1

Chateau-Renaud., 1

"Still,, 1
he, 1
ought, 1
to, 1

and, 1
the, 1
three, 1
young, 1
men, 1
drew, 1
near, 1
to, 1
listen., 1
Beauchamp, 1
told, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
when, 1
he, 1
said, 1
that, 1
on, 1
his, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
funeral, 1
he, 1
had, 1
met, 1

was, 1
directing, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Chausse, 1
d'Antin,, 1
to, 1
M., 1
Danglars'., 1
The, 1
banker, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
court, 1
yard,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sad,, 1
though, 1
affable, 1
smile., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
he,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
suppose, 1
you, 1
have, 1
come, 1
to, 1

with, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
indeed, 1
misfortune, 1
has, 1
taken, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
my, 1
house., 1
When, 1
I, 1
perceived, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
just, 1
asking, 1
myself, 1
whether, 1
I, 1
had, 1
not, 1
wished, 1
harm, 1
towards, 1
those, 1
poor, 1
Morcerfs,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
have, 1
justified, 1
the, 1
proverb, 1
of, 1
'He, 1
who, 1
wishes, 1
misfortunes, 1
to, 1
happen, 1
to, 1
others, 1
experiences, 1
them, 1
himself.', 1
Well,, 1
on, 1
my, 1
word, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
I, 1
answered,, 1
'No!', 1
I, 1
wished, 1
no, 1
ill, 1
to, 1
Morcerf;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
little, 1
proud,, 1
perhaps,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
like, 1
myself, 1
has, 1
risen, 1
from, 1
nothing;, 1
but, 1
we, 1
all, 1
have, 1
our, 1
faults., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
count,, 1
that, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
our, 1
time, 1
of, 1
life--not, 1
that, 1
you, 1
belong, 1
to, 1
the, 1
class,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
still, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man,--but, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
saying,, 1
persons, 1
of, 1
our, 1
time, 1
of, 1
life, 1
have, 1
been, 1
very, 1
unfortunate, 1
this, 1
year., 1
For, 1
example,, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
puritanical, 1
procureur,, 1
who, 1
has, 1
just, 1
lost, 1
his, 1
daughter,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
fact, 1
nearly, 1
all, 1
his, 1
family,, 1
in, 1
so, 1
singular, 1
a, 1
manner;, 1
Morcerf, 1
dishonored, 1
and, 1
dead;, 1
and, 1
then, 1
myself, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
ridicule, 1
through, 1
the, 1
villany, 1
of, 1
Benedetto;, 1
besides"--, 1
"Besides, 1
what?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
Count., 1
"Alas,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
know?", 1
"What, 1
new, 1
calamity?", 1
"My, 1
daughter"--, 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars?", 1
"Eugenie, 1
has, 1
left, 1
us!", 1
"Good, 1
heavens,, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
telling, 1
me?", 1
"The, 1
truth,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
count., 1
Oh,, 1
how, 1
happy, 1
you, 1
must, 1
be, 1
in, 1
not, 1
having, 1
either, 1
wife, 1
or, 1
children!", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
so?", 1
"Indeed, 1
I, 1
do.", 1
"And, 1
so, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars"--, 1
"She, 1
could, 1
not, 1
endure, 1
the, 1
insult, 1
offered, 1
to, 1
us, 1
by, 1
that, 1
wretch,, 1
so, 1
she, 1
asked, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
travel.", 1
"And, 1
is, 1
she, 1
gone?", 1
"The, 1
other, 1
night, 1
she, 1
left.", 1
"With, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars?", 1
"No,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
relation., 1
But, 1
still,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
quite, 1
lost, 1
our, 1
dear, 1
Eugenie;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
doubt, 1
whether, 1
her, 1
pride, 1
will, 1
ever, 1
allow, 1
her, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
France.", 1
"Still,, 1
baron,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"family, 1
griefs,, 1

indeed, 1
any, 1
other, 1
affliction, 1

Philosophers, 1
may, 1
well, 1
say,, 1
and, 1
practical, 1
men, 1
will, 1
always, 1
support, 1
the, 1
opinion,, 1
that, 1
money, 1
mitigates, 1
many, 1
trials;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
admit, 1
the, 1
efficacy, 1
of, 1
this, 1
sovereign, 1
balm,, 1
you, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
very, 1
easily, 1
consoled--you,, 1
the, 1
king, 1
of, 1
finance,, 1
the, 1
focus, 1
of, 1
immeasurable, 1
power.", 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
him, 1
askance,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
ascertain, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
seriously., 1
"Yes,", 1
he, 1
answered,, 1
"if, 1
a, 1
fortune, 1
brings, 1
consolation,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
be, 1
consoled;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
rich.", 1
"So, 1
rich,, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
that, 1
your, 1
fortune, 1
resembles, 1
the, 1
pyramids;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
demolish, 1
them, 1
you, 1
could, 1
not,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
were, 1
possible,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
not, 1
dare!", 1
Danglars, 1
smiled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
good-natured, 1
pleasantry, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"That, 1
reminds, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"that, 1
when, 1
you, 1
entered, 1

point, 1
of, 1

others?", 1
"Pray, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
pen, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
heard,, 1
while, 1
Monte, 1

examined, 1

gilt, 1
mouldings, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ceiling., 1
"Are, 1
they, 1
Spanish,, 1
Haitian,, 1

Neapolitan, 1

said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"No,", 1

added,, 1

gradually, 1
widened, 1
the, 1
features, 1
of, 1
his, 1
disturbed, 1
countenance., 1
"Certainly,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"your, 1
receipt, 1
is, 1
money.", 1
"Oh, 1
dear,, 1
yes;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
were, 1
at, 1
Rome,, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
would, 1
make, 1
no, 1
more, 1
difficulty, 1
about, 1
paying, 1
the, 1
money, 1
on, 1
my, 1
receipt, 1
than, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
done.", 1
"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
count,, 1
pardon, 1
me.", 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
may, 1
keep, 1
this, 1
money?", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
started, 1
from, 1
the, 1
roots, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hair., 1
"Yes,, 1
keep, 1
it--keep, 1
it.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
replaced, 1
the, 1
notes, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
with, 1
that, 1
indescribable, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"Come,, 1
reflect;, 1
if, 1
you, 1
repent, 1
there, 1
is, 1
still, 1
time.", 1
"No,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"no,, 1
decidedly, 1
no;, 1
keep, 1
my, 1
signatures., 1
But, 1
you, 1
know, 1
none, 1
are, 1
so, 1
formal, 1
as, 1
bankers, 1
in, 1
transacting, 1
business;, 1
I, 1
intended, 1
this, 1
money, 1
for, 1
the, 1
charity, 1
fund,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
robbing, 1
them, 1
if, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
pay, 1
them, 1
with, 1
these, 1
precise, 1
bonds., 1
How, 1
absurd--as, 1
if, 1
one, 1
crown, 1
were, 1
not, 1
as, 1
good, 1
as, 1
another., 1
Excuse, 1
me;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
began, 1
to, 1
laugh, 1
loudly,, 1
but, 1
nervously., 1
"Certainly,, 1
I, 1
excuse, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
graciously,, 1
"and, 1
pocket, 1
them.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
bonds, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket-book., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
still, 1
a, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
one, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs?", 1
"Oh,, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
nothing,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"The, 1
balance, 1
would, 1
come, 1
to, 1
about, 1
that, 1
sum;, 1
but, 1
keep, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
quits.", 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
speaking, 1
seriously?", 1
"I, 1
never, 1
joke, 1
with, 1
bankers,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
a, 1
freezing, 1
manner,, 1
which, 1
repelled, 1
impertinence;, 1
and, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre, 1
announced,--"M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
receiver-general, 1
of, 1
the, 1
charities.", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
arrived, 1
just, 1
in, 1
time, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
your, 1
signatures,, 1
or, 1
they, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
disputed, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
Danglars, 1
again, 1
became, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
hastened, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
the, 1
count, 1
out., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
exchanged, 1
a, 1
ceremonious, 1
bow, 1
with, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
waiting-room,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
was, 1
introduced, 1
into, 1
Danglars', 1
room, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
left., 1
The, 1
count's, 1
sad, 1
face, 1
was, 1
illumined, 1
by, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
smile,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
noticed, 1
the, 1
portfolio, 1
which, 1
the, 1
receiver-general, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
At, 1
the, 1
door, 1
he, 1
found, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
driven, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bank., 1
Meanwhile, 1
Danglars,, 1
repressing, 1
all, 1
emotion,, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
the, 1
receiver-general., 1
We, 1
need, 1
not, 1
say, 1
that, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
condescension, 1
was, 1
stamped, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
lips., 1
"Good-morning,, 1
creditor,", 1
said, 1
he;, 1
"for, 1
I, 1
wager, 1
anything, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
creditor, 1
who, 1
visits, 1
me.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
baron,", 1
answered, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville;, 1
"the, 1
charities, 1
present, 1
themselves, 1
to, 1
you, 1
through, 1
me:, 1
the, 1
widows, 1

orphans, 1
depute, 1
me, 1

"And, 1
yet, 1
they, 1
say, 1
orphans, 1
are, 1
to, 1
be, 1
pitied,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
prolong, 1
the, 1
jest., 1
"Poor, 1
things!", 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
their, 1
name,", 1
said, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville;, 1
"but, 1
did, 1
you, 1
receive, 1
my, 1
letter, 1
yesterday?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
brought, 1
my, 1
receipt.", 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville,, 1
your, 1
widows, 1

whom, 1
you, 1
just, 1
saw, 1

him,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
"Yes;, 1
well?", 1
"Well,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
has, 1
just, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
their, 1

"How, 1
so?", 1
"The, 1
count, 1
has, 1
an, 1
unlimited, 1
credit, 1
upon, 1
me;, 1
a, 1
credit, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
of, 1
Rome;, 1
he, 1
came, 1
to, 1
demand, 1
five, 1
millions, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
him, 1
with, 1
checks, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bank., 1
My, 1
funds, 1
are, 1
deposited, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
that, 1

I, 1
draw, 1
out, 1
ten, 1
millions, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
day, 1
it, 1
will, 1
appear, 1
rather, 1
strange, 1
to, 1
the, 1
governor., 1
Two, 1
days, 1
will, 1
be, 1
a, 1
different, 1
thing,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
smiling., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Boville,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
entire, 1
incredulity,, 1
"five, 1
millions, 1
to, 1
that, 1
gentleman, 1
who, 1
just, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
bowed, 1
to, 1

"Perhaps, 1

is, 1
his, 1
receipt., 1
Believe, 1
your, 1
own, 1
eyes.", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
took, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
Danglars, 1
presented, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
read:--, 1
"Received, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
really, 1
true,", 1

M., 1
de, 1
Boville., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1

house, 1
of, 1

"Yes,, 1

"It, 1
is, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
best, 1
houses, 1

Danglars,, 1
carelessly, 1
throwing, 1
down, 1
the, 1
receipt, 1
on, 1
his, 1
desk., 1
"And, 1

he, 1
added, 1
carelessly,, 1
"he, 1
has, 1
given, 1
me, 1
the, 1
preference,, 1

of, 1
100,000, 1

M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
manifested, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
extraordinary, 1
admiration., 1
"I, 1
must, 1
visit, 1
him,", 1
he, 1

"What, 1
example?", 1

gave, 1
all, 1
their, 1
fortune, 1
to, 1

"What, 1
fortune?", 1
"Their, 1
own--M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf's,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
deceased.", 1
"For, 1
what, 1
reason?", 1
"Because, 1
they, 1
would, 1
not, 1
spend, 1
money, 1
so, 1
guiltily, 1
acquired.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1

"Certainly,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
natural, 1
tone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1

pressed, 1
for, 1

money?", 1

M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1

nodded, 1
his, 1
head,, 1

took, 1
up, 1

portfolio., 1
"Now, 1
I, 1
think, 1
of, 1
it,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
do, 1
better,", 1

Danglars., 1

do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"The, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1

started, 1
back., 1
"Ma, 1

said,, 1
"I, 1
prefer, 1
waiting, 1
till, 1
to-morrow., 1
What, 1
a, 1
proposition!", 1
"I, 1
thought,, 1
perhaps,", 1

Danglars, 1
with, 1
supreme, 1
impertinence,, 1
"that, 1
you, 1
had, 1
a, 1
deficiency, 1
to, 1
make, 1
up?", 1
"Indeed,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
receiver., 1
"And, 1
if, 1
that, 1
were, 1
the, 1

it, 1
would, 1

worth, 1

still,, 1

afford, 1
me, 1
the, 1
pleasure, 1
of, 1

shook, 1
hands., 1

with, 1
this, 1
exclamation,, 1
after, 1
expressing, 1
acute, 1
sympathy, 1
with, 1
the, 1
father., 1
But, 1
he, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
left, 1
before, 1

an, 1
energy, 1
of, 1
action, 1

exclaimed,--"Fool!", 1
Then, 1
enclosing, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
receipt, 1
in, 1
a, 1
little, 1
pocket-book,, 1
he, 1
added:--"Yes,, 1
come, 1
at, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock;, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
then, 1
be, 1
far, 1
away.", 1
Then, 1
he, 1
double-locked, 1
his, 1
door,, 1
emptied, 1
all, 1
his, 1
drawers,, 1
collected, 1
about, 1
fifty, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
bank-notes,, 1
burned, 1
several, 1
papers,, 1
left, 1
others, 1
exposed, 1
to, 1
view,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
commenced, 1
writing, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
which, 1
he, 1
addressed:, 1

Frederic, 1
Lemaitre--French, 1
actor, 1
(1800-1876)., 1
Robert, 1

the, 1
hero, 1
of, 1
two, 1
favorite, 1
melodramas--"Chien, 1
de, 1
Montargis", 1
and, 1
"Chien, 1
d'Aubry"--and, 1
the, 1
name, 1
is, 1
applied, 1
to, 1
bold, 1
criminals, 1

derision., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
place, 1
it, 1
on, 1
her, 1
table, 1
myself, 1
to-night,", 1
he, 1
murmured., 1
Then, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
passport, 1
from, 1
his, 1
drawer, 1

said,--"Good,, 1

The, 1
Cemetery, 1
of, 1
Pere-la-Chaise., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Boville, 1
had, 1
indeed, 1
met, 1
the, 1
funeral, 1
procession, 1
which, 1
was, 1
taking, 1
Valentine, 1
to, 1
her, 1
last, 1
home, 1
on, 1
earth., 1
The, 1
weather, 1
was, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
stormy,, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
wind, 1
shook, 1
the, 1
few, 1
remaining, 1
yellow, 1
leaves, 1
from, 1
the, 1
boughs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
scattered, 1
them, 1
among, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
which, 1
filled, 1
the, 1
boulevards., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
a, 1
true, 1
Parisian,, 1
considered, 1
the, 1
cemetery, 1
of, 1
Pere-la-Chaise, 1
alone, 1
worthy, 1
of, 1
receiving, 1
the, 1
mortal, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Parisian, 1
family;, 1
there, 1
alone, 1
the, 1
corpses, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
him, 1
would, 1
be, 1
surrounded, 1
by, 1
worthy, 1
associates., 1
He, 1
had, 1
therefore, 1
purchased, 1
a, 1
vault,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
quickly, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
members, 1
of, 1
his, 1
family., 1
On, 1
the, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
monument, 1
was, 1
inscribed:, 1
"The, 1
families, 1
of, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
and, 1
Villefort,", 1
for, 1
such, 1
had, 1
been, 1
the, 1
last, 1
wish, 1
expressed, 1
by, 1
poor, 1
Renee,, 1
Valentine's, 1
mother., 1
The, 1
pompous, 1
procession, 1
therefore, 1
wended, 1
its, 1
way, 1
towards, 1
Pere-la-Chaise, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore., 1
Having, 1
crossed, 1
Paris,, 1
it, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
du, 1
Temple,, 1
then, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
exterior, 1
boulevards,, 1
it, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
cemetery., 1
More, 1
than, 1
fifty, 1
private, 1
carriages, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
twenty, 1
mourning-coaches,, 1
and, 1
behind, 1
them, 1
more, 1
than, 1
five, 1
hundred, 1
persons, 1
joined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
procession, 1
on, 1
foot., 1
These, 1
last, 1
consisted, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
young, 1
people, 1
whom, 1
Valentine's, 1
death, 1
had, 1
struck, 1
like, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
raw, 1
chilliness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
season,, 1
could, 1
not, 1
refrain, 1
from, 1
paying, 1
a, 1
last, 1
tribute, 1
to, 1
the, 1
memory, 1
of, 1
the, 1
beautiful,, 1
chaste,, 1
and, 1
adorable, 1
girl,, 1
thus, 1
cut, 1
off, 1
in, 1
the, 1
flower, 1
of, 1
her, 1
youth., 1
As, 1
they, 1
left, 1
Paris,, 1
an, 1
equipage, 1
with, 1
four, 1
horses,, 1
at, 1
full, 1
speed,, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
to, 1
draw, 1
up, 1
suddenly;, 1
it, 1
contained, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
The, 1
count, 1
left, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
and, 1
mingled, 1
in, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
who, 1
followed, 1
on, 1
foot., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
perceived, 1
him, 1
and, 1
immediately, 1
alighting, 1
from, 1
his, 1
coupe,, 1
joined, 1
him., 1
The, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
attentively, 1
through, 1
every, 1
opening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
crowd;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
evidently, 1
watching, 1
for, 1
some, 1
one,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
search, 1
ended, 1
in, 1
disappointment., 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
Morrel?", 1
he, 1
asked;, 1
"do, 1
either, 1
of, 1
these, 1
gentlemen, 1
know, 1
where, 1
he, 1
is?", 1
"We, 1
have, 1
already, 1
asked, 1
that, 1
question,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"for, 1
none, 1
of, 1
us, 1
has, 1
seen, 1
him.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
silent,, 1
but, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
gaze, 1
around, 1
him., 1
At, 1
length, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
the, 1
cemetery., 1
The, 1
piercing, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
glanced, 1
through, 1
clusters, 1
of, 1
bushes, 1
and, 1
trees,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
soon, 1
relieved, 1
from, 1
all, 1
anxiety,, 1
for, 1
seeing, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
glide, 1
between, 1
the, 1
yew-trees,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
recognized, 1
him, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
sought., 1
One, 1
funeral, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
very, 1
much, 1
like, 1
another, 1
in, 1
this, 1
magnificent, 1
metropolis., 1
Black, 1
figures, 1
are, 1
seen, 1
scattered, 1
over, 1
the, 1
long, 1
white, 1
avenues;, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
earth, 1
and, 1
heaven, 1
is, 1
alone, 1
broken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
made, 1
by, 1
the, 1
crackling, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
hedges, 1
planted, 1
around, 1
the, 1
monuments;, 1
then, 1
follows, 1
the, 1
melancholy, 1
chant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
priests,, 1
mingled, 1
now, 1
and, 1
then, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sob, 1
of, 1
anguish,, 1
escaping, 1
from, 1
some, 1
woman, 1
concealed, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
flowers., 1
The, 1
shadow, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
passed, 1
rapidly, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
tomb, 1
of, 1
Abelard, 1
and, 1
Heloise,, 1
placed, 1
itself, 1
close, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heads, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
belonging, 1
to, 1
the, 1
hearse,, 1
and, 1
following, 1
the, 1
undertaker's, 1
men,, 1
arrived, 1
with, 1
them, 1
at, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
appointed, 1
for, 1
the, 1
burial., 1
Each, 1
person's, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
occupied., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
shadow,, 1
which, 1
no, 1
one, 1
else, 1
observed., 1
Twice, 1
the, 1
count, 1
left, 1
the, 1
ranks, 1
to, 1
see, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
his, 1
interest, 1
had, 1
any, 1
concealed, 1
weapon, 1
beneath, 1
his, 1
clothes., 1
When, 1
the, 1
procession, 1
stopped,, 1
this, 1
shadow, 1
was, 1
recognized, 1
as, 1
Morrel,, 1
who,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
coat, 1
buttoned, 1
up, 1
to, 1
his, 1
throat,, 1
his, 1
face, 1
livid,, 1
and, 1
convulsively, 1
crushing, 1
his, 1
hat, 1
between, 1
his, 1
fingers,, 1
leaned, 1
against, 1
a, 1
tree,, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
an, 1
elevation, 1
commanding, 1
the, 1
mausoleum,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
none, 1
of, 1
the, 1
funeral, 1
details, 1
could, 1
escape, 1
his, 1
observation., 1
Everything, 1
was, 1
conducted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
manner., 1
A, 1
few, 1
men,, 1
the, 1
least, 1
impressed, 1
of, 1
all, 1
by, 1
the, 1
scene,, 1
pronounced, 1
a, 1
discourse,, 1
some, 1
deploring, 1
this, 1
premature, 1
death,, 1
others, 1
expatiating, 1
on, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
very, 1
ingenious, 1
person, 1
quoting, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
that, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
solicited, 1
pardon, 1
of, 1
her, 1
father, 1
for, 1
criminals, 1
on, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
arm, 1
of, 1
justice, 1
was, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
fall--until, 1
at, 1
length, 1
they, 1
exhausted, 1
their, 1
stores, 1
of, 1
metaphor, 1
and, 1
mournful, 1
speeches., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
heard, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
nothing,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
he, 1
only, 1
saw, 1
Morrel,, 1
whose, 1
calmness, 1
had, 1
a, 1
frightful, 1
effect, 1
on, 1
those, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"See,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
pointing, 1
out, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
Debray., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
he, 1
doing, 1
up, 1
there?", 1
And, 1
they, 1
called, 1
Chateau-Renaud's, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"How, 1
pale, 1
he, 1
is!", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
shuddering., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
cold,", 1
said, 1
Debray., 1
"Not, 1
at, 1
all,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
slowly;, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
he, 1
is, 1
violently, 1
agitated., 1
He, 1
is, 1
very, 1
susceptible.", 1
"Bah,", 1
said, 1
Debray;, 1
"he, 1
scarcely, 1
knew, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
you, 1
said, 1
so, 1
yourself.", 1
"True., 1
Still, 1
I, 1
remember, 1
he, 1
danced, 1
three, 1
times, 1
with, 1
her, 1
at, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf's., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
recollect, 1
that, 1
ball,, 1
count,, 1
where, 1
you, 1
produced, 1
such, 1
an, 1
effect?", 1
"No,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
without, 1
even, 1
knowing, 1
of, 1
what, 1
or, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
was, 1
speaking,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
was, 1
he, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
watching, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
holding, 1
his, 1
breath, 1
with, 1
emotion., 1
"The, 1
discourse, 1
is, 1
over;, 1
farewell,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
And, 1
he, 1
disappeared, 1
without, 1
anyone, 1
seeing, 1
whither, 1
he, 1
went., 1
The, 1
funeral, 1
being, 1
over,, 1
the, 1
guests, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
Paris., 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
looked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
for, 1
Morrel;, 1
but, 1
while, 1
they, 1
were, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
departure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
quitted, 1
his, 1
post,, 1
and, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
failing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
search,, 1
joined, 1
Debray, 1
and, 1
Beauchamp., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
concealed, 1
himself, 1
behind, 1
a, 1
large, 1
tomb, 1
and, 1
awaited, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
tomb, 1
now, 1
abandoned, 1
by, 1
spectators, 1
and, 1
workmen., 1
Morrel, 1
threw, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
around,, 1
but, 1
before, 1
it, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
had, 1
advanced, 1
yet, 1
nearer,, 1
still, 1
unperceived., 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
knelt, 1
down., 1
The, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
outstretched, 1
neck, 1
and, 1
glaring, 1
eyes,, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
an, 1
attitude, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
pounce, 1
upon, 1
Morrel, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
first, 1
occasion., 1
Morrel, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
head, 1
till, 1
it, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
stone,, 1
then, 1
clutching, 1
the, 1
grating, 1
with, 1
both, 1
hands,, 1
he, 1
murmured,--"Oh,, 1
Valentine!", 1
The, 1
count's, 1
heart, 1
was, 1
pierced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
utterance, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
words;, 1
he, 1
stepped, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
touching, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
shoulder,, 1
said,--"I, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
my, 1
friend.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
expected, 1
a, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
passion,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
was, 1
deceived,, 1
for, 1
Morrel, 1
turning, 1
round,, 1
said, 1
calmly,--, 1
"You, 1
see, 1
I, 1
was, 1
praying.", 1
The, 1
scrutinizing, 1
glance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
searched, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
from, 1
head, 1
to, 1
foot., 1
He, 1
then, 1
seemed, 1
more, 1
easy., 1
"Shall, 1
I, 1
drive, 1
you, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Paris?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"No,, 1
thank, 1
you.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
anything?", 1
"Leave, 1
me, 1
to, 1
pray.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
withdrew, 1
without, 1
opposition,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
to, 1
place, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
a, 1
situation, 1
where, 1
he, 1
could, 1
watch, 1
every, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
at, 1
length, 1
arose,, 1
brushed, 1
the, 1
dust, 1
from, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
Paris,, 1
without, 1
once, 1
looking, 1
back., 1
He, 1
walked, 1
slowly, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Roquette., 1
The, 1
count,, 1
dismissing, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
about, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
paces, 1
behind., 1
Maximilian, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
canal, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay, 1
by, 1
the, 1
boulevards., 1
Five, 1
minutes, 1
after, 1
the, 1
door, 1
had, 1
been, 1
closed, 1
on, 1
Morrel's, 1
entrance,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
again, 1
opened, 1
for, 1
the, 1
count., 1
Julie, 1
was, 1
at, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden,, 1
where, 1
she, 1
was, 1
attentively, 1
watching, 1
Penelon,, 1
who,, 1
entering, 1
with, 1
zeal, 1
into, 1
his, 1

of, 1
gardener,, 1
was, 1
very, 1
busy, 1
grafting, 1
some, 1
Bengal, 1
roses., 1
"Ah,, 1
count,", 1
she, 1
exclaimed,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
delight, 1
manifested, 1
by, 1
every, 1
member, 1
of, 1
the, 1
family, 1
whenever, 1
he, 1
visited, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay., 1
"Maximilian, 1
has, 1
just, 1
returned,, 1
has, 1
he, 1
not,, 1
madame?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
pass;, 1
but, 1
pray,, 1
call, 1
Emmanuel.", 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
madame,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
must, 1
go, 1
up, 1
to, 1
Maximilian's, 1
room, 1
this, 1
instant,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
something, 1
of, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
importance, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
him.", 1
"Go,, 1
then,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
charming, 1
smile,, 1
which, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
until, 1
he, 1
had, 1
disappeared., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
soon, 1
ran, 1
up, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
conducting, 1
from, 1
the, 1
ground-floor, 1
to, 1
Maximilian's, 1
room;, 1
when, 1
he, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
landing, 1
he, 1
listened, 1
attentively,, 1
but, 1
all, 1
was, 1
still., 1
Like, 1
many, 1
old, 1
houses, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
single, 1
family,, 1
the, 1
room, 1
door, 1
was, 1
panelled, 1
with, 1
glass;, 1
but, 1
it, 1
was, 1
locked,, 1
Maximilian, 1
was, 1
shut, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
see, 1
what, 1
was, 1
passing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
because, 1
a, 1
red, 1
curtain, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
before, 1
the, 1
glass., 1
The, 1
count's, 1
anxiety, 1
was, 1
manifested, 1
by, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
color, 1
which, 1
seldom, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
that, 1
imperturbable, 1
man., 1
"What, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
do!", 1
he, 1
uttered,, 1
and, 1
reflected, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment;, 1
"shall, 1
I, 1
ring?, 1
No,, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bell,, 1
announcing, 1
a, 1
visitor,, 1
will, 1
but, 1
accelerate, 1
the, 1
resolution, 1
of, 1
one, 1
in, 1
Maximilian's, 1
situation,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
would, 1
be, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
louder, 1
noise.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
trembled, 1
from, 1
head, 1
to, 1
foot, 1
and, 1
as, 1
if, 1
his, 1
determination, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
with, 1
the, 1
rapidity, 1
of, 1
lightning,, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
panes, 1
of, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
his, 1
elbow;, 1
the, 1
glass, 1
was, 1
shivered, 1
to, 1
atoms,, 1
then, 1
withdrawing, 1
the, 1
curtain, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
writing, 1
at, 1
his, 1
desk,, 1
bound, 1
from, 1
his, 1
seat, 1
at, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
window., 1
"I, 1
beg, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
pardons,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
nothing, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
slipped, 1
down, 1
and, 1
broke, 1
one, 1
of, 1
your, 1
panes, 1
of, 1
glass, 1
with, 1
my, 1
elbow., 1
Since, 1
it, 1
is, 1
opened,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
take, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
it, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
your, 1
room;, 1
do, 1
not, 1
disturb, 1
yourself--do, 1
not, 1
disturb, 1
yourself!", 1
And, 1
passing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
through, 1
the, 1
broken, 1
glass,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Morrel,, 1
evidently, 1
discomposed,, 1
came, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
less, 1
with, 1
the, 1
intention, 1
of, 1
receiving, 1
him, 1
than, 1
to, 1
exclude, 1
his, 1
entry., 1
"Ma, 1
foi,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
rubbing, 1
his, 1
elbow,, 1
"it's, 1
all, 1
your, 1
servant's, 1
fault;, 1
your, 1
stairs, 1
are, 1
so, 1
polished,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
like, 1
walking, 1
on, 1
glass.", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
hurt,, 1
sir?", 1
coldly, 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
not., 1
But, 1
what, 1
are, 1
you, 1
about, 1
there?, 1
You, 1
were, 1
writing.", 1
"I?", 1
"Your, 1
fingers, 1
are, 1
stained, 1
with, 1
ink.", 1
"Ah,, 1
true,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
writing., 1
I, 1
do, 1
sometimes,, 1
soldier, 1
though, 1
I, 1
am.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
advanced, 1
into, 1
the, 1
room;, 1
Maximilian, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
let, 1
him, 1
pass,, 1
but, 1
he, 1
followed, 1
him., 1
"You, 1
were, 1
writing?", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
a, 1
searching, 1
look., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
had, 1
the, 1
honor, 1
of, 1
telling, 1
you, 1
I, 1
was,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
The, 1
count, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him., 1
"Your, 1
pistols, 1
are, 1
beside, 1
your, 1
desk,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
pointing, 1
with, 1
his, 1
finger, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pistols, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
starting, 1
on, 1
a, 1
journey,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel, 1
disdainfully., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
exquisite, 1
sweetness., 1
"Sir?", 1
"My, 1
friend,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
Maximilian,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
make, 1
a, 1
hasty, 1
resolution,, 1

you.", 1
"I, 1
make, 1
a, 1
hasty, 1
resolution?", 1

Morrel,, 1
shrugging, 1
his, 1
shoulders;, 1
"is, 1
there, 1
anything, 1
extraordinary, 1
in, 1
a, 1
journey?", 1
"Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
both, 1
lay, 1
aside, 1
the, 1
mask, 1
we, 1

assumed., 1
You, 1
no, 1
more, 1

me, 1
with, 1
that, 1
false, 1
calmness, 1
than, 1
I, 1

upon, 1
you, 1

actuated, 1
by, 1
real, 1
uneasiness,, 1

rather, 1
by, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
conviction., 1
Morrel,, 1

are, 1
going, 1
to, 1

"Indeed,, 1
count,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
shuddering;, 1

has, 1
put, 1
this, 1
into, 1
your, 1
head?", 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1

about, 1

the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
here, 1
is, 1
proof, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
say;", 1
and,, 1
approaching, 1
the, 1
desk,, 1
he, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
sheet, 1
of, 1
paper, 1
which, 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
placed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
letter, 1

had, 1
begun,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
Morrel, 1
rushed, 1
forward, 1
to, 1
tear, 1
it, 1
from, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
perceiving, 1
his, 1
intention,, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
wrist, 1
with, 1
his, 1
iron, 1
grasp., 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
destroy, 1
yourself,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
written, 1
it.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
changing, 1
his, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
calmness, 1
for, 1
one, 1
of, 1
violence--"well,, 1

my, 1

distasteful, 1

me,, 1

human, 1

me., 1

me, 1

shall, 1

become, 1
mad., 1

sir,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
all, 1

tears, 1
of, 1
heartfelt, 1

could, 1
you, 1
have, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
to, 1

so?", 1
"Yes,, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
calmness, 1
which, 1
contrasted, 1
strangely, 1
with, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
excitement;, 1
"yes,, 1
I, 1
would, 1
do, 1
so.", 1
"You?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
increasing, 1
anger, 1
and, 1
reproach--"you,, 1

I, 1
will, 1
do, 1

When, 1
you, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
me, 1
at, 1
the, 1
cemetery,, 1

softened;, 1

arrived, 1

Morrel,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
maniacal, 1
laugh,, 1
again, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
pistols., 1
"And, 1
I, 1
again, 1
repeat,, 1

shall, 1
not, 1
commit, 1
suicide.", 1
"Prevent, 1
me,, 1

replied, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
another, 1
struggle,, 1
which,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
first,, 1
failed, 1
in, 1
releasing, 1
him, 1
from, 1

iron, 1
grasp., 1

with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
majesty, 1

involuntarily, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
the, 1
commanding, 1
manner, 1
of, 1

a, 1
step., 1

you, 1
mention, 1
my, 1

he, 1
fell, 1

his, 1
admirable, 1
nature, 1
underwent, 1
a, 1
complete, 1
and, 1
sudden, 1
revulsion;, 1

arose,, 1

out, 1

in, 1
alarm, 1
on, 1
hearing, 1
the, 1
cries, 1
of, 1
Maximilian., 1
Morrel, 1
seized, 1
their, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door, 1
exclaimed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
choked, 1
with, 1
sobs,, 1
"On, 1
your, 1
knees--on, 1
your, 1
knees--he, 1
is, 1
our, 1
benefactor--the, 1
saviour, 1
of, 1
our, 1
father!, 1
He, 1
is"--, 1
He, 1
would, 1
have, 1
added, 1
"Edmond, 1
Dantes,", 1
but, 1
the, 1
count, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
prevented, 1
him., 1
Julie, 1
threw, 1
herself, 1
into, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
Emmanuel, 1
embraced, 1
him, 1
as, 1
a, 1
guardian, 1
angel;, 1
Morrel, 1
again, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
and, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
with, 1
his, 1
forehead., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
iron-hearted, 1
man, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
swell, 1
in, 1
his, 1
breast;, 1
a, 1
flame, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
rush, 1
from, 1
his, 1
throat, 1
to, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
he, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
head, 1
and, 1
wept., 1
For, 1
a, 1
while, 1
nothing, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
but, 1
a, 1
succession, 1
of, 1
sobs,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
incense, 1
from, 1
their, 1
grateful, 1
hearts, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
Julie, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
recovered, 1
from, 1
her, 1
deep, 1
emotion, 1
when, 1
she, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
next, 1
floor,, 1
ran, 1
into, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
with, 1
childlike, 1
joy, 1
and, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
crystal, 1
globe, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
purse, 1
given, 1
by, 1
the, 1
unknown, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan., 1
Meanwhile,, 1
Emmanuel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
broken, 1
voice, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"Oh,, 1
count,, 1
how, 1
could, 1
you,, 1
hearing, 1
us, 1
so, 1
often, 1
speak, 1
of, 1
our, 1
unknown, 1
benefactor,, 1
seeing, 1
us, 1
pay, 1
such, 1
homage, 1
of, 1
gratitude, 1
and, 1
adoration, 1
to, 1
his, 1
memory,--how, 1
could, 1
you, 1
continue, 1
so, 1
long, 1
without, 1
discovering, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
us?, 1
Oh,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
cruel, 1
to, 1
us,, 1
and--dare, 1
I, 1
say, 1
it?--to, 1
you, 1
also.", 1
"Listen,, 1
my, 1
friends,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count--"I, 1
may, 1
call, 1
you, 1
so, 1
since, 1
we, 1
have, 1
really, 1
been, 1
friends, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
eleven, 1
years--the, 1
discovery, 1
of, 1
this, 1
secret, 1
has, 1
been, 1
occasioned, 1
by, 1
a, 1
great, 1
event, 1
which, 1
you, 1
must, 1
never, 1
know., 1
I, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
bury, 1
it, 1
during, 1
my, 1
whole, 1
life, 1
in, 1
my, 1
own, 1
bosom,, 1
but, 1
your, 1
brother, 1
Maximilian, 1
wrested, 1
it, 1
from, 1
me, 1
by, 1
a, 1
violence, 1
he, 1
repents, 1
of, 1
now,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure.", 1
Then, 1
turning, 1
around,, 1
and, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
Morrel,, 1
still, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees,, 1
had, 1
thrown, 1
himself, 1
into, 1
an, 1
arm-chair,, 1
he, 1
added, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
pressing, 1
Emmanuel's, 1
hand, 1
significantly,, 1
"Watch, 1
over, 1
him.", 1
"Why, 1
so?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
surprised., 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
explain, 1
myself;, 1
but, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
him.", 1
Emmanuel, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
the, 1
room, 1
and, 1
caught, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
pistols;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
the, 1
weapons,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
them., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
head., 1
Emmanuel, 1
went, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
pistols., 1
"Leave, 1
them,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Then, 1
walking, 1
towards, 1
Morrel,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
the, 1
tumultuous, 1
agitation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
was, 1
succeeded, 1
by, 1
a, 1
profound, 1
stupor., 1
Julie, 1
returned,, 1
holding, 1
the, 1
silken, 1
purse, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
while, 1
tears, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
her, 1
cheeks,, 1
like, 1
dewdrops, 1
on, 1
the, 1
rose., 1
"Here, 1
is, 1
the, 1
relic,", 1
she, 1
said;, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
less, 1
dear, 1
to, 1
us, 1
now, 1
we, 1
are, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
our, 1
benefactor!", 1
"My, 1
child,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
coloring,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
take, 1
back, 1
that, 1
purse?, 1
Since, 1
you, 1
now, 1
know, 1
my, 1
face,, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
be, 1
remembered, 1
alone, 1
through, 1
the, 1
affection, 1
I, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
will, 1
grant, 1
me., 1
"Oh,", 1
said, 1
Julie,, 1
pressing, 1
the, 1
purse, 1
to, 1
her, 1
heart,, 1
"no,, 1
no,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
take, 1
it,, 1
for, 1
some, 1
unhappy, 1
day, 1
you, 1
will, 1
leave, 1
us,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
guessed, 1
rightly,, 1
madame,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling;, 1
"in, 1
a, 1
week, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
left, 1
this, 1
country,, 1
where, 1
so, 1
many, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
merit, 1
the, 1
vengeance, 1
of, 1
heaven, 1
lived, 1
happily,, 1
while, 1
my, 1
father, 1
perished, 1
of, 1
hunger, 1
and, 1
grief.", 1
While, 1
announcing, 1
his, 1
departure,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
remarked, 1
that, 1
the, 1
words,, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
left, 1
this, 1
country,", 1
had, 1
failed, 1
to, 1
rouse, 1
him, 1
from, 1
his, 1
lethargy., 1
He, 1
then, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
must, 1
make, 1
another, 1
struggle, 1
against, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Emmanuel, 1
and, 1
Julie,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
pressed, 1
within, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
he, 1
said, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mild, 1
authority, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father,, 1
"My, 1
kind, 1
friends,, 1
leave, 1
me, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Maximilian.", 1
Julie, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
means, 1
offered, 1
of, 1
carrying, 1
off, 1
her, 1
precious, 1
relic,, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
forgotten., 1
She, 1
drew, 1
her, 1
husband, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
leave, 1
them,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
The, 1
count, 1
was, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
a, 1
statue., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Monte-Cristo,, 1
touching, 1
his, 1
shoulder, 1
with, 1
his, 1
finger,, 1
"are, 1
you, 1
a, 1
man, 1
again,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
"Yes;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
begin, 1
to, 1
suffer, 1
again.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
frowned,, 1
apparently, 1
in, 1
gloomy, 1
hesitation., 1
"Maximilian,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"the, 1
ideas, 1
you, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
are, 1
unworthy, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Christian.", 1
"Oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
fear,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
raising, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
smiling, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sweet, 1
expression, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
attempt, 1
my, 1
life.", 1
"Then, 1
we, 1
are, 1
to, 1
have, 1
no, 1
more, 1
pistols--no, 1
more, 1
despair?", 1
"No;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
found, 1
a, 1
better, 1
remedy, 1
for, 1
my, 1
grief, 1
than, 1
either, 1
a, 1
bullet, 1

fellow,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"My, 1
grief, 1
will, 1
kill, 1
me, 1
of, 1
itself.", 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
melancholy, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
his, 1
own,, 1
"listen, 1
to, 1
me., 1
One, 1
day,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
despair, 1

yours,, 1

it, 1
led, 1
to, 1
a, 1
similar, 1
resolution,, 1

also, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
myself;, 1
one, 1
day, 1
your, 1

one, 1
had, 1
told, 1
me,, 1
when, 1
in, 1
my, 1
prison, 1

back, 1

three, 1
days--if, 1

us, 1

will, 1
come, 1
when, 1

with, 1
that, 1

him, 1
so, 1

will, 1
bury, 1
my, 1
grief, 1
so, 1
deep, 1
in, 1
my, 1
heart,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
disguise, 1
it, 1
so,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
even, 1
care, 1
to, 1
sympathize, 1
with, 1
me., 1

my, 1
friend,, 1
adieu!", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
contrary,", 1

the, 1
count,, 1

"And, 1
you, 1
still, 1
bid, 1
me, 1
hope?", 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1

you.", 1

Morrel, 1
dropped, 1
his, 1
head, 1
with, 1
disdainful, 1
incredulity., 1
"What, 1
can, 1
I, 1
say, 1
more?", 1

Monte, 1
Cristo., 1

count,, 1

Morrel., 1

me?", 1

Morrel,, 1
intoxicated., 1
"I, 1
not, 1

it!", 1

Morrel, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
kissed, 1
it;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
allowed, 1
him, 1

floor, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Germain-des-Pres,, 1
where, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
selected, 1
a, 1
home, 1
for, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
was, 1
let, 1
to, 1
a, 1
very, 1
mysterious, 1
person., 1
This, 1
was, 1
a, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
face, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
never, 1
seen,, 1
for, 1
in, 1
the, 1
winter, 1
his, 1
chin, 1
was, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
large, 1
red, 1
handkerchiefs, 1
worn, 1
by, 1
gentlemen's, 1
coachmen, 1
on, 1
a, 1
cold, 1
night,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
summer, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
point, 1
of, 1
always, 1
blowing, 1
his, 1
nose, 1
just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Contrary, 1
to, 1
custom,, 1
this, 1
gentleman, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
watched,, 1
for, 1
as, 1
the, 1
report, 1
ran, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
person, 1
of, 1
high, 1
rank,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
who, 1
would, 1
allow, 1
no, 1
impertinent, 1
interference,, 1
his, 1
incognito, 1
was, 1
strictly, 1
respected., 1
His, 1
visits, 1
were, 1
tolerably, 1
regular,, 1
though, 1
occasionally, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
a, 1
little, 1
before, 1
or, 1
after, 1
his, 1
time,, 1
but, 1
generally,, 1
both, 1
in, 1
summer, 1
and, 1
winter,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
his, 1
apartment, 1
about, 1
four, 1
o'clock,, 1
though, 1
he, 1
never, 1
spent, 1
the, 1
night, 1
there., 1
At, 1
half-past, 1
three, 1
in, 1
the, 1
winter, 1
the, 1
fire, 1
was, 1
lighted, 1
by, 1
the, 1
discreet, 1
servant,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
the, 1
superintendence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
apartment,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
summer, 1
ices, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
hour., 1
At, 1
four, 1
o'clock,, 1
as, 1
we, 1
have, 1
already, 1
stated,, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
personage, 1
arrived., 1
Twenty, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
a, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
a, 1
lady, 1
alighted, 1
in, 1
a, 1
black, 1
or, 1
dark, 1
blue, 1
dress,, 1
and, 1
always, 1
thickly, 1
veiled;, 1
she, 1
passed, 1
like, 1
a, 1
shadow, 1
through, 1
the, 1
lodge,, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
up-stairs, 1
without, 1
a, 1
sound, 1
escaping, 1
under, 1
the, 1
touch, 1
of, 1
her, 1
light, 1
foot., 1
No, 1
one, 1
ever, 1
asked, 1
her, 1
where, 1
she, 1
was, 1
going., 1
Her, 1
face,, 1
therefore,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gentleman,, 1
was, 1
perfectly, 1
unknown, 1
to, 1
the, 1
two, 1
concierges,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
perhaps, 1
unequalled, 1
throughout, 1
the, 1
capital, 1
for, 1
discretion., 1
We, 1
need, 1
not, 1
say, 1
she, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
second, 1
floor., 1
Then, 1
she, 1
tapped, 1
in, 1
a, 1
peculiar, 1
manner, 1
at, 1
a, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
after, 1
being, 1
opened, 1
to, 1
admit, 1
her, 1
was, 1
again, 1
fastened,, 1
and, 1
curiosity, 1
penetrated, 1
no, 1
farther., 1
They, 1
used, 1
the, 1
same, 1
precautions, 1
in, 1
leaving, 1
as, 1
in, 1
entering, 1
the, 1
house., 1
The, 1
lady, 1
always, 1
left, 1
first,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
she, 1
had, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1
her, 1
carriage,, 1
it, 1
drove, 1
away,, 1
sometimes, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand,, 1
sometimes, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left;, 1
then, 1
about, 1
twenty, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
would, 1
also, 1
leave,, 1
buried, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cravat, 1
or, 1
concealed, 1
by, 1
his, 1
handkerchief., 1
The, 1
day, 1
after, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
called, 1
upon, 1
Danglars,, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
lodger, 1
entered, 1
at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
four, 1
in, 1
the, 1
afternoon., 1
Almost, 1
directly, 1
afterwards,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
interval, 1
of, 1
time,, 1
a, 1
cab, 1
arrived,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
veiled, 1
lady, 1
ran, 1
hastily, 1
up-stairs., 1
The, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
but, 1
before, 1
it, 1
could, 1
be, 1
closed,, 1
the, 1
lady, 1
exclaimed:, 1
"Oh,, 1
Lucien--oh,, 1
my, 1
friend!", 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
therefore, 1
heard, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
that, 1
the, 1
lodger's, 1
name, 1
was, 1
Lucien;, 1
still,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
very, 1
perfection, 1
of, 1
a, 1
door-keeper,, 1
he, 1
made, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
not, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter,, 1
my, 1
dear?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
whose, 1
name, 1
the, 1
lady's, 1
agitation, 1
revealed;, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter.", 1
"Oh,, 1
Lucien,, 1
can, 1
I, 1
confide, 1
in, 1
you?", 1
"Of, 1
course,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
you, 1
can, 1
do, 1
so., 1
But, 1
what, 1
can, 1
be, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
Your, 1
note, 1
of, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
has, 1
completely, 1
bewildered, 1
me., 1
This, 1
precipitation--this, 1
unusual, 1
appointment., 1
Come,, 1
ease, 1
me, 1
of, 1
my, 1
anxiety,, 1
or, 1
else, 1
frighten, 1
me, 1
at, 1
once.", 1
"Lucien,, 1
a, 1
great, 1
event, 1
has, 1
happened!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
lady,, 1
glancing, 1
inquiringly, 1
at, 1
Lucien,--"M., 1
Danglars, 1
left, 1
last, 1
night!", 1
"Left?--M., 1
Danglars, 1
left?, 1
Where, 1
has, 1
he, 1
gone?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?, 1
Has, 1
he, 1
gone, 1
intending, 1
not, 1
to, 1
return?", 1
"Undoubtedly;--at, 1
ten, 1
o'clock, 1
at, 1
night, 1
his, 1
horses, 1
took, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
of, 1
Charenton;, 1
there, 1
a, 1
post-chaise, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
for, 1
him--he, 1
entered, 1
it, 1
with, 1
his, 1
valet, 1
de, 1
chambre,, 1
saying, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
Fontainebleau.", 1
"Then, 1
what, 1
did, 1
you, 1
mean"--, 1
"Stay--he, 1
left, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
"A, 1
letter?", 1
"Yes;, 1
read, 1
it.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
took, 1
from, 1
her, 1
pocket, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
which, 1
she, 1
gave, 1
to, 1
Debray., 1
Debray, 1
paused, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
before, 1
reading,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
trying, 1
to, 1
guess, 1
its, 1
contents,, 1
or, 1
perhaps, 1
while, 1
making, 1
up, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
how, 1
to, 1
act,, 1
whatever, 1
it, 1
might, 1
contain., 1
No, 1
doubt, 1
his, 1
ideas, 1
were, 1
arranged, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
minutes,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
began, 1
reading, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
so, 1
much, 1
uneasiness, 1
in, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
ran, 1
as, 1
follows:--, 1
"Madame, 1
and, 1
most, 1
faithful, 1
wife.", 1
Debray, 1
mechanically, 1
stopped, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
whose, 1
face, 1
became, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
blushes., 1
"Read,", 1
she, 1
said., 1
Debray, 1
continued:--, 1
"When, 1
you, 1
receive, 1
this,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
have, 1
a, 1
husband., 1
Oh,, 1
you, 1
need, 1
not, 1
be, 1
alarmed,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
only, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
him, 1
as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
lost, 1
your, 1
daughter;, 1
I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
travelling, 1
on, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thirty, 1
or, 1
forty, 1
roads, 1
leading, 1
out, 1
of, 1
France., 1
I, 1
owe, 1
you, 1
some, 1
explanations, 1
for, 1
my, 1
conduct,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
that, 1
can, 1
perfectly, 1
understand, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
them., 1
Listen,, 1
then., 1
I, 1
received, 1
this, 1
morning, 1
five, 1
millions, 1
which, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
away;, 1
almost, 1
directly, 1
afterwards, 1
another, 1
demand, 1
for, 1
the, 1
same, 1
sum, 1
was, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
put, 1
this, 1
creditor, 1
off, 1
till, 1
to-morrow, 1
and, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
leaving, 1
to-day,, 1
to, 1
escape, 1
that, 1
to-morrow,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
rather, 1
too, 1
unpleasant, 1
for, 1
me, 1
to, 1
endure., 1
You, 1
understand, 1
this,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not,, 1
my, 1
most, 1
precious, 1
wife?, 1
I, 1
say, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
this,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
as, 1
conversant, 1
with, 1
my, 1
affairs, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am;, 1
indeed,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
them, 1
better,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
what, 1
has, 1
become, 1
of, 1
a, 1
considerable, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fortune,, 1
once, 1
very, 1
tolerable,, 1
while, 1
I, 1
am, 1
sure,, 1
madame,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
know, 1
perfectly, 1
well., 1
For, 1
women, 1
have, 1
infallible, 1
instincts;, 1
they, 1
can, 1
even, 1
explain, 1
the, 1
marvellous, 1
by, 1
an, 1
algebraic, 1
calculation, 1
they, 1
have, 1
invented;, 1
but, 1
I,, 1
who, 1
only, 1
understand, 1
my, 1
own, 1
figures,, 1
know, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
than, 1
that, 1
one, 1
day, 1
these, 1
figures, 1
deceived, 1
me., 1
Have, 1
you, 1
admired, 1
the, 1
rapidity, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fall?, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
slightly, 1
dazzled, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sudden, 1
fusion, 1
of, 1
my, 1
ingots?, 1
I, 1
confess, 1
I, 1
have, 1
seen, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
fire;, 1
let, 1
us, 1
hope, 1
you, 1
have, 1
found, 1
some, 1
gold, 1
among, 1
the, 1
ashes., 1
With, 1
this, 1
consoling, 1
idea,, 1
I, 1
leave, 1
you,, 1
madame,, 1
and, 1
most, 1
prudent, 1
wife,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
conscientious, 1
reproach, 1
for, 1
abandoning, 1
you;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
friends, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
ashes, 1
I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
mentioned,, 1
and, 1
above, 1
all, 1
the, 1
liberty, 1
I, 1
hasten, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
to, 1
you., 1
And, 1
here,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
must, 1
add, 1
another, 1
word, 1
of, 1
explanation., 1
So, 1
long, 1
as, 1
I, 1
hoped, 1
you, 1
were, 1
working, 1
for, 1
the, 1
good, 1
of, 1
our, 1
house, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
fortune, 1
of, 1
our, 1
daughter,, 1
I, 1
philosophically, 1
closed, 1
my, 1
eyes;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
you, 1
have, 1
transformed, 1
that, 1
house, 1
into, 1
a, 1
vast, 1
ruin, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
be, 1
the, 1
foundation, 1
of, 1
another, 1
man's, 1
fortune., 1
You, 1
were, 1
rich, 1
when, 1
I, 1
married, 1
you,, 1
but, 1
little, 1
respected., 1
Excuse, 1
me, 1
for, 1
speaking, 1
so, 1
very, 1
candidly,, 1
but, 1
as, 1
this, 1
is, 1
intended, 1
only, 1
for, 1
ourselves,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
see, 1
why, 1
I, 1
should, 1
weigh, 1
my, 1
words., 1
I, 1
have, 1
augmented, 1
our, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
has, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fifteen, 1
years,, 1
till, 1
extraordinary, 1
and, 1
unexpected, 1
catastrophes, 1
have, 1
suddenly, 1
overturned, 1
it,--without, 1
any, 1
fault, 1
of, 1
mine,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
honestly, 1
declare., 1
You,, 1
madame,, 1
have, 1
only, 1
sought, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
your, 1
own,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
succeeded., 1
I, 1
leave, 1
you,, 1
therefore,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
took, 1
you,--rich,, 1
but, 1
little, 1
respected., 1
Adieu!, 1
I, 1
also, 1
intend, 1
from, 1
this, 1
time, 1
to, 1
work, 1
on, 1
my, 1
own, 1
account., 1
Accept, 1
my, 1
acknowledgments, 1
for, 1
the, 1
example, 1
you, 1
have, 1
set, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
following., 1
"Your, 1
very, 1
devoted, 1
husband,, 1
"Baron, 1
Danglars.", 1
The, 1
baroness, 1
had, 1
watched, 1
Debray, 1
while, 1
he, 1
read, 1
this, 1
long, 1
and, 1
painful, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
him,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
self-control,, 1
change, 1
color, 1
once, 1
or, 1
twice., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ended, 1
the, 1
perusal,, 1
he, 1
folded, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
and, 1
resumed, 1
his, 1
pensive, 1
attitude., 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
anxiety, 1
easy, 1
to, 1
be, 1
understood., 1
"Well,, 1
madame?", 1
unhesitatingly, 1
repeated, 1
Debray., 1
"With, 1
what, 1
ideas, 1
does, 1
that, 1
letter, 1
inspire, 1
you?", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
simple, 1
enough,, 1
madame;, 1
it, 1
inspires, 1
me, 1
with, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
has, 1
left, 1
suspiciously.", 1
"Certainly;, 1
but, 1
is, 1
this, 1
all, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
say, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Debray, 1
with, 1
freezing, 1
coldness., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
gone!, 1
Gone,, 1
never, 1
to, 1
return!", 1
"Oh,, 1
madame,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
that!", 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
he, 1
will, 1
never, 1
return., 1
I, 1
know, 1
his, 1
character;, 1
he, 1
is, 1
inflexible, 1
in, 1
any, 1
resolutions, 1
formed, 1
for, 1
his, 1
own, 1
interests., 1
If, 1
he, 1
could, 1
have, 1
made, 1
any, 1
use, 1
of, 1
me,, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
me, 1
with, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
leaves, 1
me, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
as, 1
our, 1
separation, 1
will, 1
conduce, 1
to, 1
his, 1
benefit;--therefore, 1
he, 1
has, 1
gone,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
free, 1
forever,", 1
added, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
same, 1
supplicating, 1
tone., 1
Debray,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
answering,, 1
allowed, 1
her, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
an, 1
attitude, 1
of, 1
nervous, 1
inquiry., 1
"Well?", 1
she, 1
said, 1
at, 1
length,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
answer, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
but, 1
one, 1
question, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you,--what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
"I, 1
was, 1
going, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
baroness, 1
with, 1
a, 1
beating, 1
heart., 1
"Ah,, 1
then,, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
advice, 1
of, 1
me?", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
do, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
your, 1
advice,", 1
said, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
with, 1
anxious, 1
expectation., 1
"Then, 1
if, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
take, 1
my, 1
advice,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
coldly,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
recommend, 1
you, 1
to, 1
travel.", 1
"To, 1
travel!", 1
she, 1
murmured., 1
"Certainly;, 1
as, 1
M., 1
Danglars, 1
says,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
perfectly, 1
free., 1
In, 1
my, 1
opinion,, 1
a, 1
withdrawal, 1
from, 1
Paris, 1
is, 1
absolutely, 1
necessary, 1
after, 1
the, 1
double, 1
catastrophe, 1
of, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Danglars', 1
broken, 1
contract, 1
and, 1
M., 1
Danglars', 1
disappearance., 1
The, 1
world, 1
will, 1
think, 1
you, 1
abandoned, 1
and, 1
poor,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bankrupt, 1
would, 1
never, 1
be, 1
forgiven,, 1
were, 1
she, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
an, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
opulence., 1
You, 1
have, 1
only, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
Paris, 1
for, 1
about, 1
a, 1
fortnight,, 1
telling, 1
the, 1
world, 1
you, 1
are, 1
abandoned,, 1
and, 1
relating, 1
the, 1
details, 1
of, 1
this, 1
desertion, 1
to, 1
your, 1
best, 1
friends,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
spread, 1
the, 1
report., 1
Then, 1
you, 1
can, 1
quit, 1
your, 1
house,, 1
leaving, 1
your, 1
jewels, 1
and, 1
giving, 1
up, 1
your, 1
jointure,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
one's, 1
mouth, 1
will, 1
be, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
praises, 1
of, 1
your, 1
disinterestedness., 1
They, 1
will, 1
know, 1
you, 1
are, 1
deserted,, 1
and, 1
think, 1
you, 1
also, 1
poor,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
alone, 1
know, 1
your, 1
real, 1
financial, 1
position,, 1
and, 1
am, 1
quite, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
give, 1
up, 1
my, 1
accounts, 1
as, 1
an, 1
honest, 1
partner.", 1
The, 1
dread, 1
with, 1
which, 1
the, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
motionless, 1
baroness, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
this,, 1
was, 1
equalled, 1
by, 1
the, 1
calm, 1
indifference, 1
with, 1
which, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
spoken., 1
"Deserted?", 1
she, 1
repeated;, 1
"ah,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
indeed,, 1
deserted!, 1
You, 1
are, 1
right,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
can, 1
doubt, 1
my, 1
position.", 1
These, 1
were, 1
the, 1
only, 1
words, 1
that, 1
this, 1
proud, 1
and, 1
violently, 1
enamoured, 1
woman, 1
could, 1
utter, 1
in, 1
response, 1
to, 1
Debray., 1
"But, 1
then, 1
you, 1
are, 1
rich,--very, 1
rich,, 1
indeed,", 1
continued, 1
Debray,, 1
taking, 1
out, 1
some, 1
papers, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket-book,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
spread, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
table., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
did, 1
not, 1
see, 1
them;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
in, 1
stilling, 1
the, 1
beatings, 1
of, 1
her, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
restraining, 1
the, 1
tears, 1
which, 1
were, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
gush, 1
forth., 1
At, 1
length, 1
a, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
dignity, 1
prevailed,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
entirely, 1
master, 1
her, 1
agitation,, 1
she, 1
at, 1
least, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
preventing, 1
the, 1
fall, 1
of, 1
a, 1
single, 1
tear., 1
"Madame,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
nearly, 1
six, 1
months, 1
since, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
associated., 1
You, 1
furnished, 1
a, 1
principal, 1
of, 1
100,000, 1
francs., 1
Our, 1
partnership, 1
began, 1
in, 1
the, 1
month, 1
of, 1
April., 1
In, 1
May, 1
we, 1
commenced, 1
operations,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
course, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month, 1
gained, 1
450,000, 1
francs., 1
In, 1
June, 1
the, 1
profit, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
900,000., 1
In, 1
July, 1
we, 1
added, 1
1,700,000, 1
francs,--it, 1
was,, 1
you, 1
know,, 1
the, 1
month, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Spanish, 1
bonds., 1
In, 1
August, 1
we, 1
lost, 1
300,000, 1
francs, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
month,, 1
but, 1
on, 1
the, 1
13th, 1
we, 1
made, 1
up, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
now, 1
find, 1
that, 1
our, 1
accounts,, 1
reckoning, 1
from, 1
the, 1
first, 1
day, 1
of, 1
partnership, 1
up, 1
to, 1
yesterday,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
closed, 1
them,, 1
showed, 1
a, 1
capital, 1
of, 1
2,400,000, 1
francs,, 1
that, 1
is,, 1
1,200,000, 1
for, 1
each, 1
of, 1
us., 1
Now,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
delivering, 1
up, 1
his, 1
accounts, 1
in, 1
the, 1
methodical, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
stockbroker,, 1
"there, 1
are, 1
still, 1
80,000, 1
francs,, 1
the, 1
interest, 1
of, 1
this, 1
money,, 1
in, 1
my, 1
hands.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
baroness,, 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
never, 1
put, 1
the, 1
money, 1
out, 1
to, 1
interest.", 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Debray, 1
coldly,, 1
"I, 1
had, 1
your, 1
permission, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
use, 1
of, 1
it., 1
There, 1
are,, 1
then,, 1
40,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
your, 1
share,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
100,000, 1
you, 1
furnished, 1
me, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
with,, 1
making, 1
in, 1
all, 1
1,340,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
your, 1
portion., 1
Now,, 1
madame,, 1
I, 1
took, 1
the, 1
precaution, 1
of, 1
drawing, 1
out, 1
your, 1
money, 1
the, 1
day, 1
before, 1
yesterday;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
long, 1
ago,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
continual, 1
expectation, 1
of, 1
being, 1
called, 1
on, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
up, 1
my, 1
accounts., 1
There, 1
is, 1
your, 1
money,--half, 1
in, 1
bank-notes,, 1
the, 1
other, 1
half, 1
in, 1
checks, 1
payable, 1
to, 1
bearer., 1
I, 1
say, 1
there,, 1
for, 1
as, 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
consider, 1
my, 1
house, 1
safe, 1
enough,, 1
or, 1
lawyers, 1
sufficiently, 1
discreet,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
landed, 1
property, 1
carries, 1
evidence, 1
with, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
moreover, 1
since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
right, 1
to, 1
possess, 1
anything, 1
independent, 1
of, 1
your, 1
husband,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
kept, 1
this, 1
sum,, 1
now, 1
your, 1
whole, 1
fortune,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
chest, 1
concealed, 1
under, 1
that, 1
closet,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
greater, 1
security, 1
I, 1
myself, 1
concealed, 1
it, 1
there., 1
"Now,, 1
madame,", 1
continued, 1
Debray,, 1
first, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
closet,, 1
then, 1
the, 1
chest;--"now,, 1
madame,, 1
here, 1
are, 1
800, 1
notes, 1
of, 1
1,000., 1
francs, 1
each,, 1
resembling,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
a, 1
large, 1
book, 1
bound, 1
in, 1
iron;, 1
to, 1
this, 1
I, 1
add, 1
a, 1
certificate, 1
in, 1
the, 1
funds, 1
of, 1
25,000., 1
francs;, 1
then,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
odd, 1
cash,, 1
making, 1
I, 1
think, 1
about, 1
110,000., 1
francs,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
check, 1
upon, 1
my, 1
banker,, 1
who,, 1
not, 1
being, 1
M., 1
Danglars,, 1
will, 1
pay, 1
you, 1
the, 1
amount,, 1
you, 1
may, 1
rest, 1
assured.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
mechanically, 1
took, 1
the, 1
check,, 1
the, 1
bond,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
heap, 1
of, 1
bank-notes., 1
This, 1
enormous, 1
fortune, 1
made, 1
no, 1
great, 1
appearance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table., 1
Madame, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
tearless, 1
eyes,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
her, 1
breast, 1
heaving, 1
with, 1
concealed, 1
emotion,, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
bank-notes, 1
in, 1
her, 1
bag,, 1
put, 1
the, 1
certificate, 1
and, 1
check, 1
into, 1
her, 1
pocket-book,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
standing, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
mute,, 1
awaited, 1
one, 1
kind, 1
word, 1
of, 1
consolation., 1
But, 1
she, 1
waited, 1
in, 1
vain., 1
"Now,, 1
madame,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
fortune,, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
about, 1
60,000, 1
livres, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
which, 1
is, 1
enormous, 1
for, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
who, 1
cannot, 1
keep, 1
an, 1
establishment, 1
here, 1
for, 1
a, 1
year,, 1
at, 1
least., 1
You, 1
will, 1
be, 1
able, 1
to, 1
indulge, 1
all, 1
your, 1
fancies;, 1
besides,, 1
should, 1
you, 1
find, 1
your, 1
income, 1
insufficient,, 1
you, 1
can,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past,, 1
madame,, 1
make, 1
use, 1
of, 1
mine;, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
all, 1
I, 1
possess,, 1
on, 1
loan.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
sir--thank, 1
you,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
baroness;, 1
"you, 1
forget, 1
that, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
paid, 1
me, 1
is, 1
much, 1
more, 1
than, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
woman, 1
requires,, 1
who, 1
intends, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time,, 1
at, 1
least,, 1
to, 1
retire, 1
from, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
Debray, 1
was,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
surprised,, 1
but, 1
immediately, 1
recovering, 1
himself,, 1
he, 1
bowed, 1
with, 1
an, 1
air, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
"As, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
madame.", 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
until, 1
then,, 1
perhaps,, 1
hoped, 1
for, 1
something;, 1
but, 1
when, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
careless, 1
bow, 1
of, 1
Debray,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
glance, 1
by, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
accompanied,, 1
together, 1
with, 1
his, 1
significant, 1
silence,, 1
she, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
passion, 1
or, 1
violence, 1
or, 1
even, 1
hesitation,, 1
ran, 1
down-stairs,, 1
disdaining, 1
to, 1
address, 1
a, 1
last, 1
farewell, 1
to, 1
one, 1
who, 1
could, 1
thus, 1
part, 1
from, 1
her., 1
"Bah,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
when, 1
she, 1
had, 1
left,, 1
"these, 1
are, 1
fine, 1
projects!, 1
She, 1
will, 1
remain, 1
at, 1
home,, 1
read, 1
novels,, 1
and, 1
speculate, 1
at, 1
cards,, 1
since, 1
she, 1
can, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
do, 1
so, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Bourse.", 1
Then, 1
taking, 1
up, 1
his, 1
account, 1
book,, 1
he, 1
cancelled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
care, 1
all, 1
the, 1
entries, 1
of, 1
the, 1
amounts, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
paid, 1
away., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
1,060,000, 1
francs, 1
remaining,", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"What, 1
a, 1
pity, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
dead!, 1
She, 1
suited, 1
me, 1
in, 1
every, 1
respect,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
would, 1
have, 1
married, 1
her.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
calmly, 1
waited, 1
until, 1
the, 1
twenty, 1
minutes, 1
had, 1
elapsed, 1
after, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars', 1
departure, 1
before, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
house., 1
During, 1
this, 1
time, 1
he, 1
occupied, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
making, 1
figures,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
watch, 1
by, 1
his, 1
side., 1
Asmodeus--that, 1
diabolical, 1
personage,, 1
who, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
created, 1
by, 1
every, 1
fertile, 1
imagination, 1
if, 1
Le, 1
Sage, 1
had, 1
not, 1
acquired, 1
the, 1
priority, 1
in, 1
his, 1
great, 1
masterpiece--would, 1
have, 1
enjoyed, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
spectacle,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lifted, 1
up, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Germain-des-Pres,, 1
while, 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
casting, 1
up, 1
his, 1
figures., 1
Above, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Debray, 1
had, 1
been, 1
dividing, 1
two, 1
millions, 1
and, 1
a, 1
half, 1
with, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
another,, 1
inhabited, 1
by, 1
persons, 1
who, 1
have, 1
played, 1
too, 1
prominent, 1
a, 1
part, 1
in, 1
the, 1
incidents, 1
we, 1
have, 1
related, 1
for, 1
their, 1
appearance, 1
not, 1
to, 1
create, 1
some, 1
interest., 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
were, 1
in, 1
that, 1
room., 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
much, 1
changed, 1
within, 1
the, 1
last, 1
few, 1
days;, 1
not, 1
that, 1
even, 1
in, 1
her, 1
days, 1
of, 1
fortune, 1
she, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
dressed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
magnificent, 1
display, 1
which, 1
makes, 1
us, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
able, 1
to, 1
recognize, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
when, 1
she, 1
appears, 1
in, 1
a, 1
plain, 1
and, 1
simple, 1
attire;, 1
nor, 1
indeed,, 1
had, 1
she, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
that, 1
state, 1
of, 1
depression, 1
where, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
misery;, 1
no,, 1
the, 1
change, 1
in, 1
Mercedes, 1
was, 1
that, 1
her, 1
eye, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
sparkled,, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
smiled,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
was, 1
now, 1
a, 1
hesitation, 1
in, 1
uttering, 1
the, 1
words, 1
which, 1
formerly, 1
sprang, 1
so, 1
fluently, 1
from, 1
her, 1
ready, 1
wit., 1
It, 1
was, 1
not, 1
poverty, 1
which, 1
had, 1
broken, 1
her, 1
spirit;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
a, 1
want, 1
of, 1
courage, 1
which, 1
rendered, 1
her, 1
poverty, 1
burdensome., 1
Mercedes,, 1
although, 1
deposed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
exalted, 1
position, 1
she, 1
had, 1
occupied,, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
sphere, 1
she, 1
had, 1
now, 1
chosen,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
person, 1
passing, 1
from, 1
a, 1
room, 1
splendidly, 1
lighted, 1
into, 1
utter, 1
darkness,, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
a, 1
queen,, 1
fallen, 1
from, 1
her, 1
palace, 1
to, 1
a, 1
hovel,, 1
and, 1
who,, 1
reduced, 1
to, 1
strict, 1
necessity,, 1
could, 1
neither, 1
become, 1
reconciled, 1
to, 1
the, 1
earthen, 1
vessels, 1
she, 1
was, 1
herself, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
place, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
nor, 1
to, 1
the, 1
humble, 1
pallet, 1
which, 1
had, 1
become, 1
her, 1
bed., 1
The, 1
beautiful, 1
Catalane, 1
and, 1
noble, 1
countess, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
both, 1
her, 1
proud, 1
glance, 1
and, 1
charming, 1
smile,, 1
because, 1
she, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
misery, 1
around, 1
her;, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
were, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gray, 1
papers, 1
which, 1
economical, 1
landlords, 1
choose, 1
as, 1
not, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
show, 1
the, 1
dirt;, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
was, 1
uncarpeted;, 1
the, 1
furniture, 1
attracted, 1
the, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
attempt, 1
at, 1
luxury;, 1
indeed,, 1
everything, 1
offended, 1
eyes, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
refinement, 1
and, 1
elegance., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
lived, 1
there, 1
since, 1
leaving, 1
her, 1
house;, 1
the, 1
continual, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
oppressed, 1
her;, 1
still,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
continually, 1
watched, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
to, 1
judge, 1
the, 1
state, 1
of, 1
her, 1
feelings,, 1
she, 1
constrained, 1
herself, 1
to, 1
assume, 1
a, 1
monotonous, 1
smile, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
alone,, 1
which,, 1
contrasted, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sweet, 1
and, 1
beaming, 1
expression, 1
that, 1
usually, 1
shone, 1
from, 1
her, 1
eyes,, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
"moonlight, 1
on, 1
a, 1
statue,"--yielding, 1
light, 1
without, 1
warmth., 1
Albert,, 1
too,, 1
was, 1
ill, 1
at, 1
ease;, 1
the, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
luxury, 1
prevented, 1
him, 1
from, 1
sinking, 1
into, 1
his, 1
actual, 1
position., 1
If, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
go, 1
out, 1
without, 1
gloves,, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
appeared, 1
too, 1
white;, 1
if, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
walk, 1
through, 1
the, 1
town,, 1
his, 1
boots, 1
seemed, 1
too, 1
highly, 1
polished., 1
Yet, 1
these, 1
two, 1
noble, 1
and, 1
intelligent, 1
creatures,, 1
united, 1
by, 1
the, 1
indissoluble, 1
ties, 1
of, 1
maternal, 1
and, 1
filial, 1
love,, 1
had, 1
succeeded, 1
in, 1
tacitly, 1
understanding, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
and, 1
economizing, 1
their, 1
stores,, 1
and, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
without, 1
extorting, 1
a, 1
change, 1
of, 1
countenance,--"Mother,, 1
we, 1
have, 1
no, 1
more, 1
money.", 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
never, 1
known, 1
misery;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
often,, 1
in, 1
her, 1
youth,, 1
spoken, 1
of, 1
poverty,, 1
but, 1
between, 1
want, 1
and, 1
necessity,, 1
those, 1
synonymous, 1
words,, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
wide, 1
difference., 1
Amongst, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
Mercedes, 1
wished, 1
for, 1
a, 1
thousand, 1
things,, 1
but, 1
still, 1
she, 1
never, 1
really, 1
wanted, 1
any., 1
So, 1
long, 1
as, 1
the, 1
nets, 1
were, 1
good,, 1
they, 1
caught, 1
fish;, 1
and, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
they, 1
sold, 1
their, 1
fish,, 1
they, 1
were, 1
able, 1
to, 1
buy, 1
twine, 1
for, 1
new, 1
nets., 1
And, 1
then,, 1
shut, 1
out, 1
from, 1
friendship,, 1
having, 1
but, 1
one, 1
affection,, 1
which, 1
could, 1
not, 1
be, 1
mixed, 1
up, 1
with, 1
her, 1
ordinary, 1
pursuits,, 1
she, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
herself--of, 1
no, 1
one, 1
but, 1
herself., 1
Upon, 1
the, 1
little, 1
she, 1
earned, 1
she, 1
lived, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
she, 1
could;, 1
now, 1
there, 1
were, 1
two, 1
to, 1
be, 1
supported,, 1
and, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
live, 1
upon., 1
Winter, 1
approached., 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
no, 1
fire, 1
in, 1
that, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
naked, 1
room--she,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
stoves, 1
which, 1
heated, 1
the, 1
house, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
to, 1
the, 1
boudoir;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
not, 1
even, 1
one, 1
little, 1
flower--she, 1
whose, 1
apartment, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
conservatory, 1
of, 1
costly, 1
exotics., 1
But, 1
she, 1
had, 1
her, 1
son., 1
Hitherto, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
of, 1
fulfilling, 1
a, 1
duty, 1
had, 1
sustained, 1
them., 1
Excitement,, 1
like, 1
enthusiasm,, 1
sometimes, 1
renders, 1
us, 1
unconscious, 1
to, 1
the, 1
things, 1
of, 1
earth., 1
But, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
had, 1
calmed, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
felt, 1
themselves, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
descend, 1
from, 1
dreams, 1
to, 1
reality;, 1
after, 1
having, 1
exhausted, 1
the, 1
ideal,, 1
they, 1
found, 1
they, 1
must, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
the, 1
actual., 1
"Mother,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Albert,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
descending, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
"let, 1
us, 1
reckon, 1
our, 1
riches,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please;, 1
I, 1
want, 1
capital, 1
to, 1
build, 1
my, 1
plans, 1
upon.", 1
"Capital--nothing!", 1
replied, 1
Mercedes, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mournful, 1
smile., 1
"No,, 1
mother,--capital, 1
3,000, 1
francs., 1
And, 1
I, 1
have, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
our, 1
leading, 1
a, 1
delightful, 1
life, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
3,000, 1
francs.", 1
"Child!", 1
sighed, 1
Mercedes., 1
"Alas,, 1
dear, 1
mother,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
unhappily, 1
spent, 1
too, 1
much, 1
of, 1
your, 1
money, 1
not, 1
to, 1
know, 1
the, 1
value, 1
of, 1
it., 1
These, 1
3,000, 1
francs, 1
are, 1
enormous,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
intend, 1
building, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
foundation, 1
a, 1
miraculous, 1
certainty, 1
for, 1
the, 1
future.", 1
"You, 1
say, 1
this,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
boy;, 1
but, 1

"I, 1

Albert, 1
in, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
tone., 1
"We, 1
will, 1

you, 1
sure,, 1
Albert?", 1
"Oh,, 1

for, 1
that,, 1

again, 1
at, 1
Marseilles.", 1
"Well,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
so--let, 1
us, 1
part,", 1
said, 1
Mercedes,, 1
folding, 1
around, 1
her, 1
shoulders, 1
the, 1
only, 1
shawl, 1
she, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
away,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
accidentally, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
be, 1
a, 1
valuable, 1
black, 1
cashmere., 1
Albert, 1
gathered, 1
up, 1
his, 1
papers, 1
hastily,, 1
rang, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
the, 1
thirty, 1
francs, 1
he, 1
owed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
landlord,, 1
and, 1
offering, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
they, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
Some, 1
one, 1
was, 1
walking, 1
down, 1
before, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
person,, 1
hearing, 1
the, 1
rustling, 1
of, 1
a, 1
silk, 1
dress,, 1
turned, 1
around., 1
"Debray!", 1
muttered, 1
Albert., 1
"You,, 1
Morcerf?", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
secretary,, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
Curiosity, 1
had, 1
vanquished, 1
the, 1
desire, 1
of, 1
preserving, 1
his, 1
incognito,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
was, 1
recognized., 1
It, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
strange, 1
in, 1
this, 1
unknown, 1
spot, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
whose, 1
misfortunes, 1
had, 1
made, 1
so, 1
much, 1
noise, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
"Morcerf!", 1
repeated, 1
Debray., 1
Then, 1
noticing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dim, 1
light, 1
the, 1
still, 1
youthful, 1
and, 1
veiled, 1
figure, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf:--"Pardon, 1
me,", 1
he, 1
added, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile,, 1
"I, 1
leave, 1
you,, 1
Albert.", 1
Albert, 1
understood, 1
his, 1
thoughts., 1
"Mother,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
Mercedes,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
secretary, 1
of, 1
the, 1
minister, 1
for, 1
the, 1
interior,, 1
once, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
of, 1
mine.", 1
"How, 1
once?", 1
stammered, 1
Debray;, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"I, 1
say, 1
so,, 1
M., 1
Debray,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
friends, 1
now,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
not, 1
to, 1
have, 1
any., 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
for, 1
having, 1
recognized, 1
me,, 1
sir.", 1
Debray, 1
stepped, 1
forward,, 1
and, 1
cordially, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
his, 1
interlocutor., 1
"Believe, 1
me,, 1
dear, 1
Albert,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
emotion, 1
he, 1
was, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
feeling,--"believe, 1
me,, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
deeply, 1
for, 1
your, 1
misfortunes,, 1
and, 1
if, 1
in, 1
any, 1
way, 1
I, 1
can, 1
serve, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
yours.", 1
"Thank, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Albert,, 1
smiling., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
our, 1
misfortunes,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
still, 1
rich, 1
enough, 1
not, 1
to, 1
require, 1
assistance, 1
from, 1
any, 1
one., 1
We, 1
are, 1
leaving, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
our, 1
journey, 1
is, 1
paid,, 1
we, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
5,000, 1
francs, 1
left.", 1
The, 1
blood, 1
mounted, 1
to, 1
the, 1
temples, 1
of, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
held, 1
a, 1
million, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket-book,, 1
and, 1
unimaginative, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
help, 1
reflecting, 1
that, 1
the, 1
same, 1
house, 1
had, 1
contained, 1
two, 1
women,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
whom,, 1
justly, 1
dishonored,, 1
had, 1
left, 1
it, 1
poor, 1
with, 1
1,500,000., 1
francs, 1
under, 1
her, 1
cloak,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
unjustly, 1
stricken,, 1
but, 1
sublime, 1
in, 1
her, 1
misfortune,, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
rich, 1
with, 1
a, 1
few, 1
deniers., 1
This, 1
parallel, 1
disturbed, 1
his, 1
usual, 1
politeness,, 1
the, 1
philosophy, 1
he, 1
witnessed, 1
appalled, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
muttered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
of, 1
general, 1
civility, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
down-stairs., 1
That, 1
day, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
clerks, 1
and, 1
the, 1
subordinates, 1
had, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
to, 1
put, 1
up, 1
with, 1
from, 1
his, 1
ill-humor., 1
But, 1
that, 1
same, 1
night,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
possessor, 1
of, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
house,, 1
situated, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Boulevard, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Madeleine,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
income, 1
of, 1
50,000, 1
livres., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
just, 1
as, 1
Debray, 1
was, 1
signing, 1
the, 1
deed,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
about, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
afternoon,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Morcerf,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
affectionately, 1
embraced, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
coupe, 1
of, 1
the, 1
diligence,, 1
which, 1
closed, 1
upon, 1
her., 1
A, 1
man, 1
was, 1
hidden, 1
in, 1
Lafitte's, 1
banking-house,, 1
behind, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
little, 1
arched, 1
windows, 1
which, 1
are, 1
placed, 1
above, 1
each, 1
desk;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
Mercedes, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
diligence,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
also, 1
saw, 1
Albert, 1
withdraw., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
clouded, 1
with, 1
doubt., 1
"Alas,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"how, 1
can, 1
I, 1
restore, 1
the, 1
happiness, 1
I, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
from, 1
these, 1
poor, 1
innocent, 1
creatures?, 1
God, 1
help, 1
me!", 1
Chapter, 1
107., 1
The, 1
Lions', 1
Den., 1
One, 1
division, 1
of, 1
La, 1
Force,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
most, 1
dangerous, 1
and, 1
desperate, 1
prisoners, 1
are, 1
confined,, 1
is, 1
called, 1
the, 1
court, 1
of, 1
Saint-Bernard., 1
The, 1
prisoners,, 1
in, 1
their, 1
expressive, 1
language,, 1
have, 1
named, 1
it, 1
the, 1
"Lions', 1
Den,", 1
probably, 1
because, 1
the, 1
captives, 1
possess, 1
teeth, 1
which, 1
frequently, 1
gnaw, 1
the, 1
bars,, 1
and, 1
sometimes, 1
the, 1
keepers, 1
also., 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
prison, 1
within, 1
a, 1
prison;, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
are, 1
double, 1
the, 1
thickness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rest., 1
The, 1
gratings, 1
are, 1
every, 1
day, 1
carefully, 1
examined, 1
by, 1
jailers,, 1
whose, 1
herculean, 1
proportions, 1
and, 1
cold, 1
pitiless, 1
expression, 1
prove, 1
them, 1
to, 1
have, 1
been, 1
chosen, 1
to, 1
reign, 1
over, 1
their, 1
subjects, 1
for, 1
their, 1
superior, 1
activity, 1
and, 1
intelligence., 1
The, 1
court-yard, 1
of, 1
this, 1
quarter, 1
is, 1
enclosed, 1
by, 1
enormous, 1
walls,, 1
over, 1
which, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
glances, 1
obliquely,, 1
when, 1
it, 1
deigns, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
into, 1
this, 1
gulf, 1
of, 1
moral, 1
and, 1
physical, 1
deformity., 1
On, 1
this, 1
paved, 1
yard, 1
are, 1
to, 1
be, 1
seen,--pacing, 1
to, 1
and, 1
fro, 1
from, 1
morning, 1
till, 1
night,, 1
pale,, 1
careworn,, 1
and, 1
haggard,, 1
like, 1
so, 1
many, 1
shadows,--the, 1
men, 1
whom, 1
justice, 1
holds, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
steel, 1
she, 1
is, 1
sharpening., 1
There,, 1
crouched, 1
against, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wall, 1
which, 1
attracts, 1
and, 1
retains, 1
the, 1
most, 1
heat,, 1
they, 1
may, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
sometimes, 1
talking, 1
to, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
but, 1
more, 1
frequently, 1
alone,, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
sometimes, 1
opens, 1
to, 1
call, 1
forth, 1
one, 1
from, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
assemblage,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
in, 1
another, 1
outcast, 1
from, 1
society., 1
The, 1
court, 1
of, 1
Saint-Bernard, 1
has, 1
its, 1
own, 1
particular, 1
apartment, 1
for, 1
the, 1
reception, 1
of, 1
guests;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
rectangle,, 1
divided, 1
by, 1
two, 1
upright, 1
gratings, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
three, 1
feet, 1
from, 1
one, 1
another, 1
to, 1
prevent, 1
a, 1
visitor, 1
from, 1
shaking, 1
hands, 1
with, 1
or, 1
passing, 1
anything, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoners., 1
It, 1
is, 1
a, 1
wretched,, 1
damp,, 1
nay,, 1
even, 1
horrible, 1
spot,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
when, 1
we, 1
consider, 1
the, 1
agonizing, 1
conferences, 1
which, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
between, 1
those, 1
iron, 1
bars., 1
And, 1
yet,, 1
frightful, 1
though, 1
this, 1
spot, 1
may, 1
be,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
as, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
paradise, 1
by, 1
the, 1
men, 1
whose, 1
days, 1
are, 1
numbered;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
so, 1
rare, 1
for, 1
them, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
Lions', 1
Den, 1
for, 1
any, 1
other, 1
place, 1
than, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
Saint-Jacques, 1
or, 1
the, 1
galleys!, 1
In, 1
the, 1
court, 1
which, 1
we, 1
have, 1
attempted, 1
to, 1
describe,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
which, 1
a, 1
damp, 1
vapor, 1
was, 1
rising,, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pockets,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
excited, 1
much, 1
curiosity, 1
among, 1
the, 1
inhabitants, 1
of, 1
the, 1
"Den,", 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
walking., 1
The, 1
cut, 1
of, 1
his, 1
clothes, 1
would, 1
have, 1
made, 1
him, 1
pass, 1
for, 1
an, 1
elegant, 1
man,, 1
if, 1
those, 1
clothes, 1
had, 1
not, 1
been, 1
torn, 1
to, 1
shreds;, 1
still, 1
they, 1
did, 1
not, 1
show, 1
signs, 1
of, 1
wear,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
cloth,, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
careful, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
soon, 1
recovered, 1
its, 1
gloss, 1
in, 1
the, 1
parts, 1
which, 1
were, 1
still, 1
perfect,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
wearer, 1
tried, 1
his, 1
best, 1
to, 1
make, 1
it, 1
assume, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
a, 1
new, 1
coat., 1
He, 1
bestowed, 1
the, 1
same, 1
attention, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
cambric, 1
front, 1
of, 1
a, 1
shirt,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
considerably, 1
changed, 1
in, 1
color, 1
since, 1
his, 1
entrance, 1
into, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
polished, 1
his, 1
varnished, 1
boots, 1
with, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
handkerchief, 1
embroidered, 1
with, 1
initials, 1
surmounted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
coronet., 1
Some, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inmates, 1
of, 1
the, 1
"Lions', 1
Den", 1
were, 1
watching, 1
the, 1
operations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoner's, 1
toilet, 1
with, 1
considerable, 1
interest., 1
"See,, 1
the, 1
prince, 1
is, 1
pluming, 1
himself,", 1
said, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
thieves., 1
"He's, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
looking, 1
fellow,", 1
said, 1
another;, 1
"if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
a, 1
comb, 1
and, 1
hair-grease,, 1
he'd, 1
take, 1
the, 1
shine, 1
off, 1
the, 1
gentlemen, 1
in, 1
white, 1
kids.", 1
"His, 1
coat, 1
looks, 1
almost, 1
new,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
boots, 1
shine, 1
like, 1
a, 1
nigger's, 1
face., 1
It's, 1
pleasant, 1
to, 1
have, 1
such, 1
well-dressed, 1
comrades;, 1
but, 1
didn't, 1
those, 1
gendarmes, 1
behave, 1
shameful?--must, 1
'a, 1
been, 1
jealous,, 1
to, 1
tear, 1
such, 1
clothes!", 1
"He, 1
looks, 1
like, 1
a, 1
big-bug,", 1
said, 1
another;, 1
"dresses, 1
in, 1
fine, 1
style., 1
And,, 1
then,, 1
to, 1
be, 1
here, 1
so, 1
young!, 1
Oh,, 1
what, 1
larks!", 1
Meanwhile, 1
the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
this, 1
hideous, 1
admiration, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
wicket,, 1
against, 1
which, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
keepers, 1
was, 1
leaning., 1
"Come,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"lend, 1
me, 1
twenty, 1
francs;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
be, 1
paid;, 1
you, 1
run, 1
no, 1
risks, 1
with, 1
me., 1
Remember,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
relations, 1
who, 1
possess, 1
more, 1
millions, 1
than, 1
you, 1
have, 1

Come,, 1
I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
lend, 1
me, 1
twenty, 1
francs,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
may, 1
buy, 1
a, 1
dressing-gown;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
intolerable, 1
always, 1
to, 1
be, 1
in, 1
a, 1
coat, 1
and, 1
boots!, 1
And, 1
what, 1
a, 1
coat,, 1
sir,, 1
for, 1
a, 1
prince, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Cavalcanti!", 1
The, 1
keeper, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
shrugged, 1
his, 1
shoulders;, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
even, 1
laugh, 1
at, 1
what, 1
would, 1
have, 1
caused, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
heard, 1
so, 1
many, 1
utter, 1
the, 1
same, 1
things,--indeed,, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
nothing, 1
else., 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
man, 1
void, 1
of, 1
compassion;, 1
I'll, 1
have, 1
you, 1
turned, 1
out.", 1
This, 1
made, 1
the, 1
keeper, 1
turn, 1
around,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
burst, 1
into, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
laugh., 1
The, 1
prisoners, 1
then, 1
approached, 1
and, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
circle., 1
"I, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
with, 1
that, 1
wretched, 1
sum,", 1
continued, 1
Andrea,, 1
"I, 1
could, 1
obtain, 1
a, 1
coat,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
to, 1
receive, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
visitor, 1
I, 1
am, 1
daily, 1
expecting.", 1
"Of, 1
course--of, 1
course,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
prisoners;--"any, 1

gentleman!", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
lend, 1
him, 1
the, 1
twenty, 1
francs,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
keeper,, 1
leaning, 1
on, 1
the, 1
other, 1
shoulder;, 1
"surely, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
refuse, 1
a, 1
comrade!", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
no, 1
comrade, 1
of, 1
these, 1
people,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
proudly,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
no, 1
right, 1
to, 1
insult, 1
me, 1
thus.", 1
The, 1
thieves, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
one, 1
another, 1
with, 1
low, 1
murmurs,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
storm, 1
gathered, 1
over, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
the, 1
aristocratic, 1
prisoner,, 1
raised, 1
less, 1
by, 1
his, 1
own, 1
words, 1
than, 1
by, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
keeper., 1
The, 1
latter,, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
quelling, 1
the, 1
tempest, 1
when, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
became, 1
too, 1
violent,, 1
allowed, 1
them, 1
to, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
pitch, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
be, 1
revenged, 1
on, 1
the, 1
importunate, 1
Andrea,, 1
and, 1
besides, 1
it, 1
would, 1
afford, 1
him, 1
some, 1
recreation, 1
during, 1
the, 1
long, 1
day., 1
The, 1
thieves, 1
had, 1
already, 1
approached, 1
Andrea,, 1
some, 1
screaming,, 1
"La, 1
savate--La, 1
savate!", 1
[*], 1
a, 1
cruel, 1
operation,, 1
which, 1
consists, 1
in, 1
cuffing, 1
a, 1
comrade, 1
who, 1
may, 1
have, 1
fallen, 1
into, 1
disgrace,, 1
not, 1
with, 1
an, 1
old, 1
shoe,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
an, 1
iron-heeled, 1
one., 1
Others, 1
proposed, 1
the, 1
"anguille,", 1
another, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
recreation,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
a, 1
handkerchief, 1
is, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
sand,, 1
pebbles,, 1
and, 1
two-sous, 1
pieces,, 1
when, 1
they, 1
have, 1
them,, 1
which, 1
the, 1
wretches, 1
beat, 1
like, 1
a, 1
flail, 1
over, 1
the, 1
head, 1
and, 1
shoulders, 1
of, 1
the, 1
unhappy, 1
sufferer., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
horsewhip, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
gentleman!", 1
said, 1
others., 1
*, 1
Savate:, 1
an, 1
old, 1
shoe., 1
But, 1
Andrea,, 1
turning, 1
towards, 1
them,, 1
winked, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
rolled, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
around, 1
his, 1
cheeks,, 1
and, 1
smacked, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
equivalent, 1
to, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
words, 1
among, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
when, 1
forced, 1
to, 1
be, 1
silent., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
Masonic, 1
sign, 1
Caderousse, 1
had, 1
taught, 1
him., 1
He, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
recognized, 1
as, 1
one, 1
of, 1
them;, 1
the, 1
handkerchief, 1
was, 1
thrown, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
iron-heeled, 1
shoe, 1
replaced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wretch, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
it, 1
belonged., 1
Some, 1
voices, 1
were, 1
heard, 1
to, 1
say, 1
that, 1
the, 1
gentleman, 1
was, 1
right;, 1
that, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
be, 1
civil,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
set, 1
the, 1
example, 1
of, 1
liberty, 1
of, 1
conscience,--and, 1
the, 1
mob, 1
retired., 1
The, 1
keeper, 1
was, 1
so, 1
stupefied, 1
at, 1
this, 1
scene, 1
that, 1
he, 1
took, 1
Andrea, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
began, 1
examining, 1
his, 1
person,, 1
attributing, 1
the, 1
sudden, 1
submission, 1
of, 1
the, 1
inmates, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Lions', 1
Den, 1
to, 1
something, 1
more, 1
substantial, 1
than, 1
mere, 1
fascination., 1
Andrea, 1
made, 1
no, 1
resistance,, 1
although, 1
he, 1
protested, 1
against, 1
it., 1
Suddenly, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
at, 1
the, 1
wicket., 1
"Benedetto!", 1
exclaimed, 1
an, 1
inspector., 1
The, 1
keeper, 1
relaxed, 1
his, 1
hold., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
called,", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"To, 1
the, 1
visitors', 1
room!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
same, 1
voice., 1
"You, 1
see, 1
some, 1
one, 1
pays, 1
me, 1
a, 1
visit., 1
Ah,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sir,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
whether, 1
a, 1
Cavalcanti, 1
is, 1
to, 1
be, 1
treated, 1
like, 1
a, 1
common, 1
person!", 1
And, 1
Andrea,, 1
gliding, 1
through, 1
the, 1
court, 1
like, 1
a, 1
black, 1
shadow,, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
through, 1
the, 1
wicket,, 1
leaving, 1
his, 1
comrades,, 1
and, 1
even, 1
the, 1
keeper,, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
wonder., 1
Certainly, 1
a, 1
call, 1
to, 1
the, 1
visitors', 1
room, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
astonished, 1
Andrea, 1
less, 1
than, 1
themselves,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
wily, 1
youth,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
making, 1
use, 1
of, 1
his, 1
privilege, 1
of, 1
waiting, 1
to, 1
be, 1
claimed, 1
on, 1
his, 1
entry, 1
into, 1
La, 1
Force,, 1
had, 1
maintained, 1
a, 1
rigid, 1
silence., 1
"Everything,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"proves, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
under, 1
the, 1
protection, 1
of, 1
some, 1
powerful, 1
person,--this, 1
sudden, 1
fortune,, 1
the, 1
facility, 1
with, 1
which, 1
I, 1
have, 1
overcome, 1
all, 1
obstacles,, 1
an, 1
unexpected, 1
family, 1
and, 1
an, 1
illustrious, 1
name, 1
awarded, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
gold, 1
showered, 1
down, 1
upon, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
most, 1
splendid, 1
alliances, 1
about, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entered, 1
into., 1
An, 1
unhappy, 1
lapse, 1
of, 1
fortune, 1
and, 1
the, 1
absence, 1
of, 1
my, 1
protector, 1
have, 1
cast, 1
me, 1
down,, 1
certainly,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
forever., 1
The, 1
hand, 1
which, 1
has, 1
retreated, 1
for, 1
a, 1
while, 1
will, 1
be, 1
again, 1
stretched, 1
forth, 1
to, 1
save, 1
me, 1
at, 1
the, 1
very, 1
moment, 1
when, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
think, 1
myself, 1
sinking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
abyss., 1
Why, 1
should, 1
I, 1
risk, 1
an, 1
imprudent, 1
step?, 1
It, 1
might, 1
alienate, 1
my, 1
protector., 1
He, 1
has, 1
two, 1
means, 1
of, 1
extricating, 1
me, 1
from, 1
this, 1
dilemma,--the, 1
one, 1
by, 1
a, 1
mysterious, 1
escape,, 1
managed, 1
through, 1
bribery;, 1
the, 1
other, 1
by, 1
buying, 1
off, 1
my, 1
judges, 1
with, 1
gold., 1
I, 1
will, 1
say, 1
and, 1
do, 1
nothing, 1
until, 1
I, 1
am, 1
convinced, 1
that, 1
he, 1
has, 1
quite, 1
abandoned, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
then"--, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
plan, 1
which, 1
was, 1
tolerably, 1
clever., 1
The, 1
unfortunate, 1
youth, 1
was, 1
intrepid, 1
in, 1
the, 1
attack,, 1
and, 1
rude, 1
in, 1
the, 1
defence., 1
He, 1
had, 1
borne, 1
with, 1
the, 1
public, 1
prison,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
privations, 1
of, 1
all, 1
sorts;, 1
still,, 1
by, 1
degrees, 1
nature,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
custom,, 1
had, 1
prevailed,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
suffered, 1
from, 1
being, 1
naked,, 1
dirty,, 1
and, 1
hungry., 1
It, 1
was, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
discomfort, 1
that, 1
the, 1
inspector's, 1
voice, 1
called, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
visiting-room., 1
Andrea, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
leap, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
It, 1
was, 1
too, 1
soon, 1
for, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
from, 1
the, 1
examining, 1
magistrate,, 1
and, 1
too, 1
late, 1
for, 1
one, 1
from, 1
the, 1
director, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
doctor;, 1
it, 1
must,, 1
then,, 1
be, 1
the, 1
visitor, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
for., 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
grating, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
into, 1
which, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
been, 1
led,, 1
he, 1
saw,, 1
while, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
dilated, 1
with, 1
surprise,, 1
the, 1
dark, 1
and, 1
intelligent, 1
face, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Bertuccio,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
also, 1
gazing, 1
with, 1
sad, 1
astonishment, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
bars,, 1
the, 1
bolted, 1
doors,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
which, 1
moved, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
other, 1
grating., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
deeply, 1
affected., 1
"Good, 1
morning,, 1
Benedetto,", 1
said, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
deep,, 1
hollow, 1
voice., 1
"You--you?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
looking, 1
fearfully, 1
around, 1
him., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
me,, 1
unhappy, 1
child?", 1
"Silence,--be, 1
silent!", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
delicate, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
possessed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
walls;, 1
"for, 1
heaven's, 1
sake,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
so, 1
loud!", 1
"You, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
with, 1
me, 1
alone,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
not?", 1
said, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes.", 1
"That, 1
is, 1
well.", 1
And, 1
Bertuccio,, 1
feeling, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
signed, 1
to, 1
a, 1
keeper, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
through, 1
the, 1
window, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wicket., 1
"Read?", 1
he, 1
said., 1
"What, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
asked, 1
Andrea., 1
"An, 1
order, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
you, 1
to, 1
a, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
you, 1
there, 1
to, 1
talk, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
"Oh,", 1
cried, 1
Andrea,, 1
leaping, 1
with, 1
joy., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
mentally, 1
added,--"Still, 1
my, 1
unknown, 1
protector!, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
forgotten., 1
They, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
secrecy,, 1
since, 1
we, 1
are, 1
to, 1
converse, 1
in, 1
a, 1
private, 1
room., 1
I, 1
understand,, 1
Bertuccio, 1
has, 1
been, 1
sent, 1
by, 1
my, 1
protector.", 1
The, 1
keeper, 1
spoke, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
with, 1
an, 1
official,, 1
then, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
gates, 1
and, 1
conducted, 1
Andrea, 1
to, 1
a, 1
room, 1
on, 1
the, 1
first, 1
floor., 1
The, 1
room, 1
was, 1
whitewashed,, 1
as, 1
is, 1
the, 1
custom, 1
in, 1
prisons,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
looked, 1
quite, 1
brilliant, 1
to, 1
a, 1
prisoner,, 1
though, 1
a, 1
stove,, 1
a, 1
bed,, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
table, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
of, 1
its, 1
sumptuous, 1
furniture., 1
Bertuccio, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
chair,, 1
Andrea, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
bed;, 1
the, 1
keeper, 1
retired., 1
"Now,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
steward,, 1
"what, 1
have, 1
you, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me?", 1
"And, 1
you?", 1
said, 1
Andrea., 1
"You, 1
speak, 1
first.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no., 1
You, 1
must, 1
have, 1
much, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
have, 1
come, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
me.", 1
"Well,, 1
be, 1
it, 1
so., 1
You, 1
have, 1
continued, 1
your, 1
course, 1
of, 1
villany;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
robbed--you, 1
have, 1
assassinated.", 1
"Well,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
say!, 1
If, 1
you, 1
had, 1
me, 1
taken, 1
to, 1
a, 1
private, 1
room, 1
only, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
this,, 1
you, 1
might, 1
have, 1
saved, 1
yourself, 1
the, 1
trouble., 1
I, 1
know, 1
all, 1
these, 1
things., 1
But, 1
there, 1
are, 1
some, 1
with, 1
which,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
acquainted., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
of, 1
those,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please., 1
Who, 1
sent, 1
you?", 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
on, 1
quickly,, 1
M., 1
Benedetto!", 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
to, 1
the, 1
point., 1
Let, 1
us, 1
dispense, 1
with, 1
useless, 1
words., 1
Who, 1
sends, 1
you?", 1
"No, 1
one.", 1
"How, 1
did, 1
you, 1
know, 1
I, 1
was, 1
in, 1
prison?", 1
"I, 1
recognized, 1
you,, 1
some, 1
time, 1
since,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
insolent, 1
dandy, 1
who, 1
so, 1
gracefully, 1
mounted, 1
his, 1
horse, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees.", 1
"Oh,, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees?, 1
Ah,, 1
yes;, 1
we, 1
burn,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
say, 1
at, 1
the, 1
game, 1
of, 1
pincette., 1
The, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees?, 1
Come,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
a, 1
little, 1
about, 1
my, 1
father.", 1
"Who,, 1
then,, 1
am, 1
I?", 1
"You,, 1
sir?--you, 1
are, 1
my, 1
adopted, 1
father., 1
But, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
you,, 1
I, 1
presume,, 1
who, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
my, 1
disposal, 1
100,000, 1
francs,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
spent, 1
in, 1
four, 1
or, 1
five, 1
months;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
you, 1
who, 1
manufactured, 1
an, 1
Italian, 1
gentleman, 1
for, 1
my, 1
father;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
you, 1
who, 1
introduced, 1
me, 1
into, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
me, 1
invited, 1
to, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
dinner, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
fancy, 1
I, 1
am, 1
eating, 1
at, 1
this, 1
moment,, 1
in, 1
company, 1
with, 1
the, 1
most, 1
distinguished, 1
people, 1
in, 1
Paris--amongst, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
with, 1
a, 1
certain, 1
procureur,, 1
whose, 1
acquaintance, 1
I, 1
did, 1
very, 1
wrong, 1
not, 1
to, 1
cultivate,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
very, 1
useful, 1
to, 1
me, 1
just, 1
now;--it, 1
was, 1
not, 1
you,, 1
in, 1
fact,, 1
who, 1
bailed, 1
me, 1
for, 1
one, 1
or, 1
two, 1
millions,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
discovery, 1
of, 1
my, 1

a, 1
little, 1
overcome,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
solemnity, 1
of, 1
Bertuccio's, 1

with, 1
so, 1

with, 1
joy., 1

the, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1

the, 1

addressing, 1
himself, 1

Andrea, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand;, 1
Bertuccio, 1
kept, 1
his, 1
own, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
merely, 1
jingled, 1
a, 1
few, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
money., 1
"That's, 1
what, 1
I, 1
mean,", 1

Andrea,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
smile,, 1
quite, 1
overcome, 1
by, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
tranquillity, 1
of, 1
Bertuccio., 1
"Can, 1
I, 1
be, 1
deceived?", 1
he, 1
murmured,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
stepped, 1
into, 1

oblong, 1

grated, 1

added,, 1

towards, 1
Bertuccio., 1

Chapter, 1
108., 1
The, 1
Judge., 1
We, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni, 1
remained, 1
alone, 1
with, 1
Noirtier, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
of, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
and, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
were, 1
the, 1
sole, 1
guardians, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
body., 1
Perhaps, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
Christian, 1
exhortations, 1
of, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
perhaps, 1
his, 1
kind, 1
charity,, 1
perhaps, 1
his, 1
persuasive, 1
words,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
restored, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
of, 1
Noirtier,, 1
for, 1
ever, 1
since, 1
he, 1
had, 1
conversed, 1
with, 1
the, 1
priest, 1
his, 1
violent, 1
despair, 1
had, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
a, 1
calm, 1
resignation, 1
which, 1
surprised, 1
all, 1
who, 1
knew, 1
his, 1
excessive, 1
affection, 1
for, 1
Valentine., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
not, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
father, 1
since, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
death., 1
The, 1
whole, 1
establishment, 1
had, 1
been, 1
changed;, 1
another, 1
valet, 1
was, 1
engaged, 1
for, 1
himself,, 1
a, 1
new, 1
servant, 1
for, 1
Noirtier,, 1
two, 1
women, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
service,--in, 1
fact,, 1
everywhere,, 1
to, 1
the, 1
concierge, 1
and, 1
coachmen,, 1
new, 1
faces, 1
were, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
the, 1
different, 1
masters, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
thus, 1
widening, 1
the, 1
division, 1
which, 1
had, 1
always, 1
existed, 1
between, 1
the, 1
members, 1
of, 1
the, 1
same, 1
family., 1
The, 1
assizes,, 1
also,, 1
were, 1
about, 1
to, 1
begin,, 1
and, 1
Villefort,, 1
shut, 1
up, 1
in, 1
his, 1
room,, 1
exerted, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
feverish, 1
anxiety, 1
in, 1
drawing, 1
up, 1
the, 1
case, 1
against, 1
the, 1
murderer, 1
of, 1
Caderousse., 1
This, 1
affair,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
those, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
interfered,, 1
caused, 1
a, 1
great, 1
sensation, 1
in, 1
Paris., 1
The, 1
proofs, 1
were, 1
certainly, 1
not, 1
convincing,, 1
since, 1
they, 1
rested, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
few, 1
words, 1
written, 1
by, 1
an, 1
escaped, 1
galley-slave, 1
on, 1
his, 1
death-bed,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
actuated, 1
by, 1
hatred, 1
or, 1
revenge, 1
in, 1
accusing, 1
his, 1
companion., 1
But, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
was, 1
made, 1
up;, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
assured, 1
that, 1
Benedetto, 1
was, 1
guilty,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
by, 1
his, 1
skill, 1
in, 1
conducting, 1
this, 1
aggravated, 1
case, 1
to, 1
flatter, 1
his, 1
self-love,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
about, 1
the, 1
only, 1
vulnerable, 1
point, 1
left, 1
in, 1
his, 1
frozen, 1
heart., 1
The, 1
case, 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
prepared, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
incessant, 1
labor, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
wished, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
the, 1
first, 1
on, 1
the, 1
list, 1
in, 1
the, 1
coming, 1
assizes., 1
He, 1
had, 1
been, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
seclude, 1
himself, 1
more, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
to, 1
evade, 1
the, 1
enormous, 1
number, 1
of, 1
applications, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
him, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
obtaining, 1
tickets, 1
of, 1
admission, 1
to, 1
the, 1
court, 1
on, 1
the, 1
day, 1
of, 1
trial., 1
And, 1
then, 1
so, 1
short, 1
a, 1
time, 1
had, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
poor, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gloom, 1
which, 1
overshadowed, 1
the, 1
house, 1
was, 1
so, 1
recent,, 1
that, 1
no, 1
one, 1
wondered, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
father, 1
so, 1
absorbed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
professional, 1
duties,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
the, 1
only, 1
means, 1
he, 1
had, 1
of, 1
dissipating, 1
his, 1
grief., 1
Once, 1
only, 1
had, 1
Villefort, 1
seen, 1
his, 1
father;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
day, 1
after, 1
that, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
Bertuccio, 1
had, 1
paid, 1
his, 1
second, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
Benedetto,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
was, 1
to, 1
learn, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
name., 1
The, 1
magistrate,, 1
harassed, 1
and, 1
fatigued,, 1
had, 1
descended, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
of, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
mood,, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
that, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Tarquin, 1
lopped, 1
off, 1
the, 1
tallest, 1
poppies,, 1
he, 1
began, 1
knocking, 1
off, 1
with, 1
his, 1
cane, 1
the, 1
long, 1
and, 1
dying, 1
branches, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rose-trees,, 1
which,, 1
placed, 1
along, 1
the, 1
avenue,, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
spectres, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brilliant, 1
flowers, 1
which, 1
had, 1
bloomed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
past, 1
season., 1
More, 1
than, 1
once, 1
he, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
that, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
where, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
boarded, 1
gate, 1
stood, 1
overlooking, 1
the, 1
deserted, 1
enclosure,, 1
always, 1
returning, 1
by, 1
the, 1
same, 1
path,, 1
to, 1
begin, 1
his, 1
walk, 1
again,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
pace, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
gesture,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
accidentally, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
whence, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
noisy, 1
play, 1
of, 1
his, 1
son,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
returned, 1
from, 1
school, 1
to, 1
spend, 1
the, 1
Sunday, 1
and, 1
Monday, 1
with, 1
his, 1
mother., 1
While, 1
doing, 1
so,, 1
he, 1
observed, 1
M., 1
Noirtier, 1
at, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
open, 1
windows,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
had, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
enjoy, 1
the, 1
last, 1
rays, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
which, 1
yet, 1
yielded, 1
some, 1
heat,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
now, 1
shining, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
flowers, 1
and, 1
red, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
the, 1
creeper, 1
which, 1
twined, 1
around, 1
the, 1
balcony., 1
The, 1
eye, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
was, 1
riveted, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
spot, 1
which, 1
Villefort, 1
could, 1
scarcely, 1
distinguish., 1
His, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
so, 1
full, 1
of, 1
hate,, 1
of, 1
ferocity,, 1
and, 1
savage, 1
impatience,, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
turned, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
path, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
pursuing,, 1
to, 1
see, 1
upon, 1
what, 1
person, 1
this, 1
dark, 1
look, 1
was, 1
directed., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
beneath, 1
a, 1
thick, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
linden-trees,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
nearly, 1
divested, 1
of, 1
foliage,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
sitting, 1
with, 1
a, 1
book, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
perusal, 1
of, 1
which, 1
she, 1
frequently, 1
interrupted, 1
to, 1
smile, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
back, 1
his, 1
elastic, 1
ball,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
obstinately, 1
threw, 1
from, 1
the, 1
drawing-room, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
Villefort, 1
became, 1
pale;, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man's, 1
meaning., 1
Noirtier, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
look, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
object,, 1
but, 1
suddenly, 1
his, 1
glance, 1
was, 1
transferred, 1
from, 1
the, 1
wife, 1
to, 1
the, 1
husband,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
to, 1
submit, 1
to, 1
the, 1
searching, 1
investigation, 1
of, 1
eyes,, 1
which,, 1
while, 1
changing, 1
their, 1
direction, 1
and, 1
even, 1
their, 1
language,, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
none, 1
of, 1
their, 1
menacing, 1
expression., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
unconscious, 1
of, 1
the, 1
passions, 1
that, 1
exhausted, 1
their, 1
fire, 1
over, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment, 1
held, 1
her, 1
son's, 1
ball,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
making, 1
signs, 1
to, 1
him, 1
to, 1
reclaim, 1
it, 1
with, 1
a, 1
kiss., 1
Edward, 1
begged, 1
for, 1
a, 1
long, 1
while,, 1
the, 1
maternal, 1
kiss, 1
probably, 1
not, 1
offering, 1
sufficient, 1
recompense, 1
for, 1
the, 1
trouble, 1
he, 1
must, 1
take, 1
to, 1
obtain, 1
it;, 1
however, 1
at, 1
length, 1
he, 1
decided,, 1
leaped, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window, 1
into, 1
a, 1
cluster, 1
of, 1
heliotropes, 1
and, 1
daisies,, 1
and, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
streaming, 1
with, 1
perspiration., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
wiped, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
lips, 1
upon, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
sent, 1
him, 1
back, 1
with, 1
the, 1
ball, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
some, 1
bonbons, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other., 1
Villefort,, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
an, 1
irresistible, 1
attraction,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bird, 1
to, 1
the, 1
serpent,, 1
walked, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
house., 1
As, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
it,, 1
Noirtier's, 1
gaze, 1
followed, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
appeared, 1
of, 1
such, 1
a, 1
fiery, 1
brightness, 1
that, 1
Villefort, 1
felt, 1
them, 1
pierce, 1
to, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
In, 1
that, 1
earnest, 1
look, 1
might, 1
be, 1
read, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
reproach,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
menace., 1
Then, 1
Noirtier, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
remind, 1
his, 1
son, 1
of, 1
a, 1
forgotten, 1
oath., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
Villefort, 1
from, 1
below,--"it, 1
is, 1
well;, 1
have, 1
patience, 1
but, 1
one, 1
day, 1
longer;, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
said, 1
I, 1
will, 1
do.", 1
Noirtier, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
calmed, 1
by, 1
these, 1
words,, 1
and, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
with, 1
indifference, 1
to, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side., 1
Villefort, 1
violently, 1
unbuttoned, 1
his, 1
great-coat,, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
strangle, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
passing, 1
his, 1
livid, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
study., 1
The, 1
night, 1
was, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
still;, 1
the, 1
family, 1
had, 1
all, 1
retired, 1
to, 1
rest, 1
but, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
alone, 1
remained, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
worked, 1
till, 1
five, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning,, 1
reviewing, 1
the, 1
last, 1
interrogatories, 1
made, 1
the, 1
night, 1
before, 1
by, 1
the, 1
examining, 1
magistrates,, 1
compiling, 1
the, 1
depositions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
witnesses,, 1
and, 1
putting, 1
the, 1
finishing, 1
stroke, 1
to, 1
the, 1
deed, 1
of, 1
accusation,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
energetic, 1
and, 1
best, 1
conceived, 1
of, 1
any, 1
he, 1
had, 1
yet, 1
delivered., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day,, 1
Monday,, 1
was, 1
the, 1
first, 1
sitting, 1
of, 1
the, 1
assizes., 1
The, 1
morning, 1
dawned, 1
dull, 1
and, 1
gloomy,, 1
and, 1
Villefort, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
dim, 1
gray, 1
light, 1
shine, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
lines, 1
he, 1
had, 1
traced, 1
in, 1
red, 1
ink., 1
The, 1
magistrate, 1
had, 1
slept, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
time, 1
while, 1
the, 1
lamp, 1
sent, 1
forth, 1
its, 1
final, 1
struggles;, 1
its, 1
flickerings, 1
awoke, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
found, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
as, 1
damp, 1
and, 1
purple, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
had, 1
been, 1
dipped, 1
in, 1
blood., 1
He, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
window;, 1
a, 1
bright, 1
yellow, 1
streak, 1
crossed, 1
the, 1
sky,, 1
and, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
divide, 1
in, 1
half, 1
the, 1
poplars,, 1
which, 1
stood, 1
out, 1
in, 1
black, 1
relief, 1
on, 1
the, 1
horizon., 1
In, 1
the, 1
clover-fields, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
chestnut-trees,, 1
a, 1
lark, 1
was, 1
mounting, 1
up, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
while, 1
pouring, 1
out, 1
her, 1
clear, 1
morning, 1
song., 1
The, 1
damps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dew, 1
bathed, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
refreshed, 1
his, 1
memory., 1
"To-day,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
with, 1
an, 1
effort,--"to-day, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
holds, 1
the, 1
blade, 1
of, 1
justice, 1
must, 1
strike, 1
wherever, 1
there, 1
is, 1
guilt.", 1
Involuntarily, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
wandered, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
window, 1
of, 1
Noirtier's, 1
room,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
him, 1
the, 1
preceding, 1
night., 1
The, 1
curtain, 1
was, 1
drawn,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
the, 1
image, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father, 1
was, 1
so, 1
vivid, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
that, 1
he, 1
addressed, 1
the, 1
closed, 1
window, 1
as, 1
though, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
open,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
if, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening, 1
he, 1
had, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
menacing, 1
old, 1
man., 1
"Yes,", 1
he, 1
murmured,--"yes,, 1
be, 1
satisfied.", 1
His, 1
head, 1
dropped, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
chest,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
this, 1
position, 1
he, 1
paced, 1
his, 1
study;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself,, 1
dressed, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was,, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
sofa,, 1
less, 1
to, 1
sleep, 1
than, 1
to, 1
rest, 1
his, 1
limbs,, 1
cramped, 1
with, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
study., 1
By, 1
degrees, 1
every, 1
one, 1
awoke., 1
Villefort,, 1
from, 1
his, 1
study,, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
successive, 1
noises, 1
which, 1
accompany, 1
the, 1
life, 1
of, 1
a, 1
house,--the, 1
opening, 1
and, 1
shutting, 1
of, 1
doors,, 1
the, 1
ringing, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
bell,, 1
to, 1
summon, 1
the, 1
waiting-maid,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
first, 1
shouts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
who, 1
rose, 1
full, 1
of, 1
the, 1
enjoyment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
age., 1
Villefort, 1
also, 1
rang;, 1
his, 1
new, 1
valet, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
the, 1
papers,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
them, 1
a, 1
cup, 1
of, 1
chocolate., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
bringing, 1
me?", 1
said, 1
he., 1
"A, 1
cup, 1
of, 1
chocolate.", 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
ask, 1
for, 1
it., 1
Who, 1
has, 1
paid, 1
me, 1
this, 1
attention?", 1
"My, 1
mistress,, 1
sir., 1
She, 1
said, 1
you, 1
would, 1
have, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
in, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
case,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
you, 1
should, 1
take, 1
something, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
up, 1
your, 1
strength;", 1
and, 1
the, 1
valet, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
cup, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table, 1
nearest, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sofa,, 1
which, 1
was,, 1
like, 1
all, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
papers., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
then, 1
left, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Villefort, 1
looked, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gloomy, 1
expression,, 1
then,, 1
suddenly,, 1
taking, 1
it, 1
up, 1
with, 1
a, 1
nervous, 1
motion,, 1
he, 1
swallowed, 1
its, 1
contents, 1
at, 1
one, 1
draught., 1
It, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
he, 1
hoped, 1
the, 1
beverage, 1
would, 1
be, 1
mortal,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
sought, 1
for, 1
death, 1
to, 1
deliver, 1
him, 1
from, 1
a, 1
duty, 1
which, 1
he, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
die, 1
than, 1
fulfil., 1
He, 1
then, 1
rose,, 1
and, 1
paced, 1
his, 1
room, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
terrible, 1
to, 1
witness., 1
The, 1
chocolate, 1
was, 1
inoffensive,, 1
for, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
felt, 1
no, 1
effects., 1
The, 1
breakfast-hour, 1
arrived,, 1
but, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
not, 1
at, 1
table., 1
The, 1
valet, 1
re-entered., 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
remind, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"that, 1
eleven, 1
o'clock, 1
has, 1
just, 1
struck,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
commences, 1
at, 1
twelve.", 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
"what, 1
then?", 1
"Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
dressed;, 1
she, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
ready,, 1
and, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
know, 1
if, 1
she, 1
is, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
you,, 1
sir?", 1
"Where, 1
to?", 1
"To, 1
the, 1
Palais.", 1
"What, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
"My, 1
mistress, 1
wishes, 1
much, 1
to, 1
be, 1
present, 1
at, 1
the, 1
trial.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
startling, 1
accent;, 1
"does, 1
she, 1
wish, 1
that?"--The, 1
man, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
and, 1
said,, 1
"If, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
go, 1
alone,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
my, 1
mistress.", 1
Villefort, 1
remained, 1
silent, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
and, 1
dented, 1
his, 1
pale, 1
cheeks, 1
with, 1
his, 1
nails., 1
"Tell, 1
your, 1
mistress,", 1
he, 1
at, 1
length, 1
answered,, 1
"that, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
beg, 1
she, 1
will, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
me, 1
in, 1
her, 1
own, 1
room.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir.", 1
"Then, 1
come, 1
to, 1
dress, 1
and, 1
shave, 1
me.", 1
"Directly,, 1
sir.", 1
The, 1
valet, 1
re-appeared, 1
almost, 1
instantly,, 1
and,, 1
having, 1
shaved, 1
his, 1
master,, 1
assisted, 1
him, 1
to, 1
dress, 1
entirely, 1
in, 1
black., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
finished,, 1
he, 1
said,--, 1
"My, 1
mistress, 1
said, 1
she, 1
should, 1
expect, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
as, 1
soon, 1
as, 1
you, 1
had, 1
finished, 1
dressing.", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
going, 1
to, 1
her.", 1
And, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
papers, 1
under, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
and, 1
hat, 1
in, 1
hand,, 1
directed, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
toward, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
At, 1
the, 1
door, 1
he, 1
paused, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
to, 1
wipe, 1
his, 1
damp,, 1
pale, 1
brow., 1
He, 1
then, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
room., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
on, 1
an, 1
ottoman, 1
and, 1
impatiently, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
the, 1
leaves, 1
of, 1
some, 1
newspapers, 1
and, 1
pamphlets, 1
which, 1
young, 1
Edward,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
amusing, 1
himself,, 1
was, 1
tearing, 1
to, 1
pieces, 1
before, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
could, 1
finish, 1
reading, 1
them., 1
She, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
to, 1
go, 1
out,, 1
her, 1
bonnet, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
beside, 1
her, 1
on, 1
a, 1
chair,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
gloves, 1
were, 1
on, 1
her, 1
hands., 1
"Ah,, 1
here, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
monsieur,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
in, 1
her, 1
naturally, 1
calm, 1
voice;, 1
"but, 1
how, 1
pale, 1
you, 1
are!, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
working, 1
all, 1
night?, 1
Why, 1
did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
come, 1
down, 1
to, 1
breakfast?, 1
Well,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
take, 1
me,, 1
or, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
take, 1
Edward?", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
multiplied, 1
her, 1
questions, 1
in, 1
order, 1
to, 1
gain, 1
one, 1
answer,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
all, 1
her, 1
inquiries, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
remained, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
cold, 1
as, 1
a, 1
statue., 1
"Edward,", 1
said, 1
Villefort,, 1
fixing, 1
an, 1
imperious, 1
glance, 1
on, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
"go, 1
and, 1
play, 1
in, 1
the, 1
drawing-room,, 1
my, 1
dear;, 1
I, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
your, 1
mamma.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
that, 1
cold, 1
countenance,, 1
that, 1
resolute, 1
tone,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
awfully, 1
strange, 1
preliminaries., 1
Edward, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
his, 1
mother,, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
finding, 1
that, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
confirm, 1
the, 1
order,, 1
began, 1
cutting, 1
off, 1
the, 1
heads, 1
of, 1
his, 1
leaden, 1
soldiers., 1
"Edward,", 1
cried, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
so, 1
harshly, 1
that, 1
the, 1
child, 1
started, 1
up, 1
from, 1
the, 1
floor,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
me?--Go!", 1
The, 1
child,, 1
unaccustomed, 1
to, 1
such, 1
treatment,, 1
arose,, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
trembling;, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
say, 1
whether, 1
his, 1
emotion, 1
were, 1
caused, 1
by, 1
fear, 1
or, 1
passion., 1
His, 1
father, 1
went, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
took, 1
him, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
kissed, 1
his, 1
forehead., 1
"Go,", 1
he, 1
said:, 1
"go,, 1
my, 1
child.", 1
Edward, 1
ran, 1
out., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
and, 1
bolted., 1
"Dear, 1
me!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
woman,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
read, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
inmost, 1
thoughts,, 1
while, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
passed, 1
over, 1
her, 1
countenance, 1
which, 1
froze, 1
the, 1
impassibility, 1
of, 1
Villefort;, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?", 1
"Madame,, 1
where, 1
do, 1
you, 1
keep, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
you, 1
generally, 1
use?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
magistrate,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
introduction,, 1
placing, 1
himself, 1
between, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
must, 1
have, 1
experienced, 1
something, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
of, 1
a, 1
bird, 1
which,, 1
looking, 1
up,, 1
sees, 1
the, 1
murderous, 1
trap, 1
closing, 1
over, 1
its, 1
head., 1
A, 1
hoarse,, 1
broken, 1
tone,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
neither, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
nor, 1
a, 1
sigh,, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
her,, 1
while, 1
she, 1
became, 1
deadly, 1
pale., 1
"Monsieur,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"I--I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
you.", 1
And,, 1
in, 1
her, 1
first, 1
paroxysm, 1
of, 1
terror,, 1
she, 1
had, 1
raised, 1
herself, 1
from, 1
the, 1
sofa,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
next,, 1
stronger, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
than, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
down, 1
again, 1
on, 1
the, 1
cushions., 1
"I, 1
asked, 1
you,", 1
continued, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
perfectly, 1
calm, 1
tone,, 1
"where, 1
you, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
poison, 1
by, 1
the, 1
aid, 1
of, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
killed, 1
my, 1
father-in-law,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
my, 1
mother-in-law,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
Barrois,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
daughter, 1
Valentine.", 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
clasping, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
say?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
for, 1
you, 1
to, 1
interrogate,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
answer.", 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
to, 1
the, 1
judge, 1
or, 1
to, 1
the, 1
husband?", 1
stammered, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"To, 1
the, 1
judge--to, 1
the, 1
judge,, 1
madame!", 1
It, 1
was, 1
terrible, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
the, 1
frightful, 1
pallor, 1
of, 1
that, 1
woman,, 1
the, 1
anguish, 1
of, 1
her, 1
look,, 1
the, 1
trembling, 1
of, 1
her, 1
whole, 1
frame., 1
"Ah,, 1
sir,", 1
she, 1
muttered,, 1
"ah,, 1
sir,", 1
and, 1
this, 1
was, 1
all., 1
"You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
answer,, 1
madame!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
terrible, 1
interrogator., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
yet, 1
more, 1
terrible, 1
than, 1
his, 1
anger,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
true,, 1
then;, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
deny, 1
it!", 1
She, 1
moved, 1
forward., 1
"And, 1
you, 1
cannot, 1
deny, 1
it!", 1
added, 1
Villefort,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
toward, 1
her,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
seize, 1
her, 1
in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
justice., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
accomplished, 1
these, 1
different, 1
crimes, 1
with, 1
impudent, 1
address,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
could, 1
only, 1
deceive, 1
those, 1
whose, 1
affections, 1
for, 1
you, 1
blinded, 1
them., 1
Since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
known, 1
that, 1
a, 1
poisoner, 1
lived, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house., 1
M., 1
d'Avrigny, 1
warned, 1
me, 1
of, 1
it., 1
After, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Barrois, 1
my, 1
suspicions, 1
were, 1
directed, 1
towards, 1
an, 1
angel,--those, 1
suspicions, 1
which,, 1
even, 1
when, 1
there, 1
is, 1
no, 1
crime,, 1
are, 1
always, 1
alive, 1
in, 1
my, 1
heart;, 1
but, 1
after, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
there, 1
has, 1
been, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
in, 1
my, 1
mind,, 1
madame,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
only, 1
in, 1
mine,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
those, 1
of, 1
others;, 1
thus, 1
your, 1
crime,, 1
known, 1
by, 1
two, 1
persons,, 1
suspected, 1
by, 1
many,, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
become, 1
public,, 1
and,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
just, 1
now,, 1
you, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
the, 1
husband,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
the, 1
judge.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
hid, 1
her, 1
face, 1
in, 1
her, 1
hands., 1
"Oh,, 1
sir,", 1
she, 1
stammered,, 1
"I, 1
beseech, 1
you,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
appearances.", 1
"Are, 1
you,, 1
then,, 1
a, 1
coward?", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
contemptuous, 1
voice., 1
"But, 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
observed, 1
that, 1
poisoners, 1
were, 1
cowards., 1
Can, 1
you, 1
be, 1
a, 1
coward,--you, 1
who, 1
have, 1
had, 1
the, 1
courage, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
two, 1
old, 1
men, 1

a, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
murdered, 1
by, 1
you?", 1
"Sir!, 1
sir!", 1
"Can, 1
you, 1
be, 1
a, 1
coward?", 1
continued, 1
Villefort,, 1
with, 1
increasing, 1
excitement,, 1
"you,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
count,, 1
one, 1
by, 1
one,, 1
the, 1
minutes, 1
of, 1
four, 1
death, 1
agonies?, 1
You,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
arranged, 1
your, 1
infernal, 1
plans,, 1
and, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
beverages, 1
with, 1
a, 1
talent, 1
and, 1
precision, 1

have, 1
calculated, 1
everything, 1
with, 1
such, 1
nicety,, 1

you, 1
forgotten, 1
to, 1
calculate, 1
one, 1
thing--I, 1
mean, 1
where, 1
the, 1
revelation, 1
of, 1
your, 1
crimes, 1
will, 1
lead, 1
you, 1
to?, 1
Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
impossible--you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
saved, 1

surer,, 1
more, 1
subtle, 1

have, 1
done, 1
this--I, 1

so,, 1
at, 1
least.", 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
stretched, 1
out, 1
her, 1
hands,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
her, 1

times, 1

drops, 1
of, 1

Madame, 1
de, 1

uttered, 1
a, 1

cry,, 1

a, 1
hideous, 1
and, 1

terror, 1

over, 1
her, 1
distorted, 1
features., 1
"Oh,, 1

scaffold,, 1

the, 1
magistrate;, 1

unhappy, 1
woman,, 1
completely, 1
overwhelmed., 1

she, 1
rose,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
hair, 1
dishevelled,, 1

her, 1
lips, 1
foaming., 1

Madame, 1
de, 1

arms, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1

convulsively, 1
struck, 1

that, 1

mercy,, 1

flaming, 1
glance;, 1

my, 1
son?, 1

ha,, 1
ha!", 1
and, 1
a, 1
frightful,, 1
demoniac, 1
laugh, 1
finished, 1
the, 1
sentence,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
rattle., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1

fell, 1
at, 1
her, 1
husband's, 1
feet., 1
He, 1
approached, 1
her., 1
"Think, 1

overwhelmed,, 1
crushed;, 1
her, 1
eye, 1
alone, 1
lived,, 1

glared, 1
horribly., 1
"Do, 1

me?", 1

she, 1
sunk, 1

carpet., 1
The, 1
king's, 1

he, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
less, 1
severely,, 1

bowing, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
said, 1
slowly,, 1
"Farewell,, 1

farewell!", 1
That, 1
farewell, 1
struck, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
like, 1
the, 1
executioner's, 1
knife., 1

fainted., 1

trouble, 1
in, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Benedetto, 1
for, 1
the, 1
murder, 1
of, 1
his, 1
comrade, 1
in, 1
chains., 1
In, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
many,, 1
Benedetto, 1
appeared,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
a, 1
victim, 1
to,, 1
at, 1
least, 1
an, 1
instance, 1
of,, 1
the, 1
fallibility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law., 1
M., 1
Cavalcanti,, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
re-appear, 1
to, 1
claim, 1
the, 1
illustrious, 1
outcast., 1
Many,, 1
also,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
not, 1
aware, 1
of, 1
the, 1
circumstances, 1
attending, 1
his, 1
withdrawal, 1
from, 1
Paris,, 1
were, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
the, 1
worthy, 1
appearance,, 1
the, 1
gentlemanly, 1
bearing,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
world, 1
displayed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
old, 1
patrician,, 1
who, 1
certainly, 1
played, 1
the, 1
nobleman, 1
very, 1
well,, 1
so, 1
long, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
made, 1
no, 1
arithmetical, 1
calculations., 1
As, 1
for, 1
the, 1
accused, 1
himself,, 1
many, 1
remembered, 1
him, 1
as, 1
being, 1
so, 1
amiable,, 1
so, 1
handsome,, 1
and, 1
so, 1
liberal,, 1
that, 1
they, 1
chose, 1
to, 1
think, 1
him, 1
the, 1
victim, 1
of, 1
some, 1
conspiracy,, 1
since, 1
in, 1
this, 1
world, 1
large, 1
fortunes, 1
frequently, 1
excite, 1
the, 1
malevolence, 1
and, 1
jealousy, 1
of, 1
some, 1
unknown, 1
enemy., 1
Every, 1
one,, 1
therefore,, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
the, 1
court;, 1
some, 1
to, 1
witness, 1
the, 1
sight,, 1
others, 1
to, 1
comment, 1
upon, 1
it., 1
From, 1
seven, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
morning, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
was, 1
stationed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
iron, 1
gates,, 1
and, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
before, 1
the, 1
trial, 1
commenced, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
was, 1
full, 1
of, 1
the, 1
privileged., 1
Before, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magistrates,, 1
and, 1
indeed, 1
frequently, 1
afterwards,, 1
a, 1
court, 1
of, 1
justice,, 1
on, 1
days, 1
when, 1
some, 1
especial, 1
trial, 1
is, 1
to, 1
take, 1
place,, 1
resembles, 1
a, 1
drawing-room, 1
where, 1
many, 1
persons, 1
recognize, 1
each, 1
other, 1
and, 1
converse, 1
if, 1
they, 1
can, 1
do, 1
so, 1
without, 1
losing, 1
their, 1
seats;, 1
or,, 1
if, 1
they, 1
are, 1
separated, 1
by, 1
too, 1
great, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
lawyers,, 1
communicate, 1
by, 1
signs., 1
It, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
magnificent, 1
autumn, 1
days, 1
which, 1
make, 1
amends, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
summer;, 1
the, 1
clouds, 1
which, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
perceived, 1
at, 1
sunrise, 1
had, 1
all, 1
disappeared, 1
as, 1
if, 1
by, 1
magic,, 1
and, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
softest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
brilliant, 1
days, 1
of, 1
September, 1
shone, 1
forth, 1
in, 1
all, 1
its, 1
splendor., 1
Beauchamp,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
kings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
press,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
claiming, 1
the, 1
right, 1
of, 1
a, 1
throne, 1
everywhere,, 1
was, 1
eying, 1
everybody, 1
through, 1
his, 1
monocle., 1
He, 1
perceived, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
and, 1
Debray,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
gained, 1
the, 1
good, 1
graces, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sergeant-at-arms,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
persuaded, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
to, 1
let, 1
them, 1
stand, 1
before,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
they, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
have, 1
done., 1
The, 1
worthy, 1
sergeant, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
secretary, 1
and, 1
the, 1
millionnaire,, 1
and,, 1
by, 1
way, 1
of, 1
paying, 1
extra, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
his, 1
noble, 1
neighbors,, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
their, 1
places, 1
while, 1
they, 1
paid, 1
a, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"we, 1
shall, 1
see, 1
our, 1
friend!", 1
"Yes,, 1
indeed!", 1
replied, 1
Debray., 1
"That, 1
worthy, 1
prince., 1
Deuce, 1
take, 1
those, 1
Italian, 1
princes!", 1
"A, 1
man,, 1
too,, 1
who, 1
could, 1
boast, 1
of, 1
Dante, 1
for, 1
a, 1
genealogist,, 1
and, 1
could, 1
reckon, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
'Divine, 1
Comedy.'", 1
"A, 1
nobility, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rope!", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud, 1
phlegmatically., 1
"He, 1
will, 1
be, 1
condemned,, 1
will, 1
he, 1
not?", 1
asked, 1
Debray, 1
of, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1
I, 1
think, 1
we, 1
should, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
that, 1
question;, 1
you, 1
know, 1
such, 1
news, 1
much, 1
better, 1
than, 1
we, 1
do., 1
Did, 1
you, 1
see, 1
the, 1
president, 1
at, 1
the, 1
minister's, 1
last, 1
night?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"What, 1
did, 1
he, 1
say?", 1
"Something, 1
which, 1
will, 1
surprise, 1
you.", 1
"Oh,, 1
make, 1
haste, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
me,, 1
then;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
long, 1
time, 1
since, 1
that, 1
has, 1
happened.", 1
"Well,, 1
he, 1
told, 1
me, 1
that, 1
Benedetto,, 1
who, 1
is, 1
considered, 1
a, 1
serpent, 1
of, 1
subtlety, 1
and, 1
a, 1
giant, 1
of, 1
cunning,, 1
is, 1
really, 1
but, 1
a, 1
very, 1
commonplace,, 1
silly, 1
rascal,, 1
and, 1
altogether, 1
unworthy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
experiments, 1
that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
made, 1
on, 1
his, 1
phrenological, 1
organs, 1
after, 1
his, 1
death.", 1
"Bah,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"he, 1
played, 1
the, 1
prince, 1
very, 1
well.", 1
"Yes,, 1
for, 1
you, 1
who, 1
detest, 1
those, 1
unhappy, 1
princes,, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
and, 1
are, 1
always, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
find, 1
fault, 1
with, 1
them;, 1
but, 1
not, 1
for, 1
me,, 1
who, 1
discover, 1
a, 1
gentleman, 1
by, 1
instinct,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
scent, 1
out, 1
an, 1
aristocratic, 1
family, 1
like, 1
a, 1
very, 1
bloodhound, 1
of, 1
heraldry.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
never, 1
believed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
principality?", 1
"Yes.--in, 1
the, 1
principality,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
prince.", 1
"Not, 1
so, 1
bad,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"still,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you,, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
very, 1
well, 1
with, 1
many, 1
people;, 1
I, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
ministers', 1
houses.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"The, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
thinking, 1
ministers, 1
understand, 1
anything, 1
about, 1
princes!", 1
"There, 1
is, 1
something, 1
in, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
just, 1
said,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
laughing., 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
Debray, 1
to, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"if, 1
I, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
you, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
with, 1
the, 1
procureur.", 1
"It, 1
was, 1
an, 1
impossibility;, 1
for, 1
the, 1
last, 1
week, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
has, 1
secluded, 1
himself., 1
It, 1
is, 1
natural, 1
enough;, 1
this, 1
strange, 1
chain, 1
of, 1
domestic, 1
afflictions,, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
no, 1
less, 1
strange, 1
death, 1
of, 1
his, 1
daughter"--, 1
"Strange?, 1
What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean,, 1
Beauchamp?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
do, 1
you, 1
pretend, 1
that, 1
all, 1
this, 1
has, 1
been, 1
unobserved, 1
at, 1
the, 1
minister's?", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
eye-glass, 1
in, 1
his, 1
eye,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
make, 1
it, 1
remain., 1
"My, 1
dear, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
that, 1
manoeuvre, 1
with, 1
the, 1
eye-glass, 1
half, 1
so, 1
well, 1
as, 1
Debray., 1
Give, 1
him, 1
a, 1
lesson,, 1
Debray.", 1
"Stay,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"surely, 1
I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
deceived.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
she!", 1
"Whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"They, 1
said, 1
she, 1
had, 1
left.", 1
"Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie?", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"has, 1
she, 1
returned?", 1
"No,, 1
but, 1
her, 1
mother.", 1
"Madame, 1
Danglars?, 1
Nonsense!, 1
Impossible!", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud;, 1
"only, 1
ten, 1
days, 1
after, 1
the, 1
flight, 1
of, 1
her, 1
daughter,, 1
and, 1
three, 1
days, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bankruptcy, 1
of, 1
her, 1
husband?", 1
Debray, 1
colored, 1
slightly,, 1
and, 1
followed, 1
with, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
of, 1
Beauchamp's, 1
glance., 1
"Come,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
only, 1
a, 1
veiled, 1
lady,, 1
some, 1
foreign, 1
princess,, 1
perhaps, 1
the, 1
mother, 1
of, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
But, 1
you, 1
were, 1
just, 1
speaking, 1
on, 1
a, 1
very, 1
interesting, 1
topic,, 1
Beauchamp.", 1
"I?", 1
"Yes;, 1
you, 1
were, 1
telling, 1
us, 1
about, 1
the, 1
extraordinary, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Valentine.", 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,, 1
so, 1
I, 1
was., 1
But, 1
how, 1
is, 1
it, 1
that, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here?", 1
"Poor,, 1
dear, 1
woman,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"she, 1
is, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
occupied, 1
in, 1
distilling, 1
balm, 1
for, 1
the, 1
hospitals,, 1
or, 1
in, 1
making, 1
cosmetics, 1
for, 1
herself, 1
or, 1
friends., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
she, 1
spends, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
thousand, 1
crowns, 1
a, 1
year, 1
in, 1
this, 1
amusement?, 1
But, 1
I, 1
wonder, 1
she, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here., 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
been, 1
pleased, 1
to, 1
see, 1
her,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
like, 1
her, 1
very, 1
much.", 1
"And, 1
I, 1
hate, 1
her,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Why?", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know., 1
Why, 1
do, 1
we, 1
love?, 1
Why, 1
do, 1
we, 1
hate?, 1
I, 1
detest, 1
her,, 1
from, 1
antipathy.", 1
"Or,, 1
rather,, 1
by, 1
instinct.", 1
"Perhaps, 1
so., 1
But, 1
to, 1
return, 1
to, 1
what, 1
you, 1
were, 1
saying,, 1
Beauchamp.", 1
"Well,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
why, 1
they, 1
die, 1
so, 1
multitudinously, 1
at, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's?", 1
"'Multitudinously', 1
is, 1
good,", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud., 1
"My, 1
good, 1
fellow,, 1
you'll, 1
find, 1
the, 1
word, 1
in, 1
Saint-Simon.", 1
"But, 1
the, 1
thing, 1
itself, 1
is, 1
at, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort's;, 1
but, 1
let's, 1
get, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
subject.", 1
"Talking, 1
of, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Debray,, 1
"Madame, 1
was, 1
making, 1
inquiries, 1
about, 1
that, 1
house,, 1
which, 1
for, 1
the, 1

three, 1
months, 1
has, 1
been, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
black.", 1
"Who, 1
is, 1

Chateau-Renaud., 1

your, 1
pardon!, 1

are, 1
brilliant;, 1

compassion, 1
on, 1

up.", 1

Chateau-Renaud;, 1

have, 1
compassion, 1
upon, 1
me,, 1

up, 1

"Come,, 1

us, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
get, 1
to, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
our, 1
story,, 1

I, 1
told, 1
you, 1

"Well,, 1
gentlemen,, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
people, 1

multitudinously, 1

two, 1
young, 1
men, 1
shuddered,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
same, 1
idea, 1
had, 1
more, 1
than, 1
once, 1
occurred, 1
to, 1
them., 1
"And, 1
who, 1
is, 1
the, 1
assassin;", 1
they, 1
asked, 1
together., 1
"Young, 1
Edward!", 1
A, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
laughter, 1
from, 1
the, 1
auditors, 1
did, 1
not, 1
in, 1
the, 1
least, 1
disconcert, 1
the, 1
speaker,, 1

continued,--"Yes,, 1

every, 1
now, 1
and, 1
then, 1
uses, 1
against, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
displeased, 1
him., 1
First,, 1
M., 1
and, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Saint-Meran, 1
incurred, 1
his, 1
displeasure,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
poured, 1
out, 1
three, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
his, 1
elixir--three, 1
drops, 1
were, 1
sufficient;, 1
then, 1
followed, 1
Barrois,, 1
the, 1
old, 1
servant, 1
of, 1
M., 1
Noirtier,, 1
who, 1
sometimes, 1
rebuffed, 1
this, 1
little, 1
wretch--he, 1
therefore, 1
received, 1
the, 1
same, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
elixir;, 1
the, 1
same, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
Valentine,, 1

he, 1
was, 1
jealous;, 1
he, 1
gave, 1
her, 1
the, 1

dose, 1

the, 1
others,, 1

as, 1
the, 1

"Why,, 1
what, 1
nonsense, 1
are, 1
you, 1
telling, 1
us?", 1

Chateau-Renaud., 1
"Yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
an, 1
extraordinary, 1
story,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp;, 1
"is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
absurd,", 1
said, 1
Debray., 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"you, 1
doubt, 1
me?, 1
Well,, 1
you, 1
can, 1
ask, 1
my, 1

rather, 1
him, 1
who, 1
will, 1
no, 1

it?", 1

child, 1
conceals, 1
it.", 1

where, 1
did, 1
he, 1
find, 1
it?", 1
"In, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
laboratory.", 1
"Does, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
then,, 1
keep, 1
poisons, 1
in, 1
her, 1
laboratory?", 1
"How, 1
can, 1
I, 1
tell?, 1
You, 1
are, 1
questioning, 1
me, 1

a, 1

incredible!", 1
"No,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1

Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
bet, 1
anything, 1

out,", 1

Debray;, 1
"besides,, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1

"By, 1
the, 1
way,, 1

de, 1

Beauchamp,, 1

is, 1
Morrel?", 1
"Ma, 1
foi,, 1

called, 1
three, 1
times, 1

his, 1

noise, 1

door-keeper, 1

out, 1

the, 1
object, 1
of, 1
unusual, 1
attention,, 1

we, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
said, 1
of, 1
general, 1
admiration,, 1
sat, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arm-chair, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
tranquil, 1
glance, 1
around, 1
him., 1
Every, 1
one, 1
looked, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
on, 1
that, 1
grave, 1
and, 1
severe, 1
face,, 1
whose, 1
calm, 1
expression, 1
personal, 1
griefs, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1

and, 1
the, 1
aspect, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
was, 1
a, 1
stranger, 1
to, 1
all, 1
human, 1
emotions, 1
excited, 1
something, 1
very, 1
like, 1
terror., 1
"Gendarmes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
"lead, 1
in, 1
the, 1
accused.", 1
At, 1
these, 1
words, 1
the, 1
public, 1
attention, 1
became, 1
more, 1
intense,, 1
and, 1
all, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
through, 1
which, 1
Benedetto, 1
was, 1
to, 1
enter., 1
The, 1
door, 1
soon, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
the, 1
accused, 1
appeared., 1
The, 1
same, 1
impression, 1
was, 1
experienced, 1
by, 1
all, 1
present,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
was, 1
deceived, 1
by, 1
the, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance., 1
His, 1
features, 1
bore, 1
no, 1
sign, 1
of, 1
that, 1
deep, 1
emotion, 1
which, 1
stops, 1
the, 1
beating, 1
of, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
and, 1
blanches, 1
the, 1
cheek., 1
His, 1
hands,, 1
gracefully, 1
placed,, 1
one, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
hat,, 1

white, 1
waistcoat,, 1

not, 1
at, 1
all, 1
tremulous;, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
even, 1
brilliant., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
when, 1
he, 1
glanced, 1
at, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
body, 1
of, 1
magistrates, 1
and, 1
assistants;, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
rested, 1
longer, 1
on, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
more, 1
so, 1
on, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney., 1
By, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
Andrea, 1
was, 1
stationed, 1
the, 1
lawyer, 1
who, 1
was, 1
to, 1
conduct, 1
his, 1
defence,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
appointed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
for, 1
Andrea, 1
disdained, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
any, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
those, 1
details,, 1
to, 1
which, 1
he, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
attach, 1
no, 1
importance., 1
The, 1
lawyer, 1
was, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
with, 1
light, 1
hair, 1
whose, 1
face, 1
expressed, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
times, 1
more, 1
emotion, 1
than, 1
that, 1
which, 1
characterized, 1
the, 1
prisoner., 1
The, 1
president, 1
called, 1
for, 1
the, 1
indictment,, 1
revised, 1
as, 1
we, 1
know,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
clever, 1
and, 1
implacable, 1
pen, 1
of, 1
Villefort., 1
During, 1
the, 1
reading, 1
of, 1
this,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
long,, 1
the, 1
public, 1
attention, 1
was, 1
continually, 1
drawn, 1
towards, 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
bore, 1
the, 1
inspection, 1
with, 1
Spartan, 1
unconcern., 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
so, 1
concise, 1
and, 1
eloquent., 1
The, 1
crime, 1
was, 1
depicted, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
vivid, 1
colors;, 1
the, 1
former, 1
life, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoner,, 1
his, 1
transformation,, 1
a, 1
review, 1
of, 1
his, 1
life, 1
from, 1
the, 1
earliest, 1
period,, 1
were, 1
set, 1
forth, 1
with, 1
all, 1
the, 1
talent, 1
that, 1
a, 1
knowledge, 1
of, 1
human, 1
life, 1
could, 1
furnish, 1
to, 1
a, 1
mind, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur., 1
Benedetto, 1
was, 1
thus, 1
forever, 1
condemned, 1
in, 1
public, 1
opinion, 1
before, 1
the, 1
sentence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
law, 1
could, 1
be, 1
pronounced., 1
Andrea, 1
paid, 1
no, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
the, 1
successive, 1
charges, 1
which, 1
were, 1
brought, 1
against, 1
him., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
examined, 1
him, 1
attentively,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
practiced, 1
upon, 1
him, 1
all, 1
the, 1
psychological, 1
studies, 1
he, 1
was, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
use,, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
make, 1
him, 1
lower, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
depth, 1
and, 1
profundity, 1
of, 1
his, 1
gaze., 1
At, 1
length, 1
the, 1
reading, 1
of, 1
the, 1
indictment, 1
was, 1
ended., 1
"Accused,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
"your, 1
name, 1
and, 1
surname?", 1
Andrea, 1
arose., 1
"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
Mr., 1
President,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
clear, 1
voice,, 1
"but, 1
I, 1
see, 1
you, 1
are, 1
going, 1
to, 1
adopt, 1
a, 1
course, 1
of, 1
questions, 1
through, 1
which, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
follow, 1
you., 1
I, 1
have, 1
an, 1
idea,, 1
which, 1
I, 1
will, 1
explain, 1
by, 1
and, 1
by,, 1
of, 1
making, 1
an, 1
exception, 1
to, 1
the, 1
usual, 1
form, 1
of, 1
accusation., 1
Allow, 1
me,, 1
then,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
please,, 1
to, 1
answer, 1
in, 1
different, 1
order,, 1
or, 1
I, 1
will, 1
not, 1
do, 1
so, 1
at, 1
all.", 1
The, 1
astonished, 1
president, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
jury,, 1
who, 1
in, 1
turn, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Villefort., 1
The, 1
whole, 1
assembly, 1
manifested, 1
great, 1
surprise,, 1
but, 1
Andrea, 1
appeared, 1
quite, 1
unmoved., 1
"Your, 1
age?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president;, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
answer, 1
that, 1
question?", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
answer, 1
that, 1
question,, 1
as, 1
well, 1
as, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
Mr., 1
President,, 1
but, 1
in, 1
its, 1
turn.", 1
"Your, 1
age?", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
twenty-one, 1
years, 1
old,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
in, 1
a, 1
few, 1
days,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
was, 1
born, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
the, 1
27th, 1
of, 1
September,, 1
1817.", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
busy, 1
taking, 1
down, 1
some, 1
notes,, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
this, 1
date., 1
"Where, 1
were, 1
you, 1
born?", 1
continued, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"At, 1
Auteuil,, 1
near, 1
Paris.", 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
a, 1
second, 1
time, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
Benedetto, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
gazing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Medusa,, 1
and, 1
became, 1
livid., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Benedetto,, 1
he, 1
gracefully, 1
wiped, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
with, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
cambric, 1
pocket-handkerchief., 1
"Your, 1
profession?", 1
"First, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
forger,", 1
answered, 1
Andrea,, 1
as, 1
calmly, 1
as, 1
possible;, 1
"then, 1
I, 1
became, 1
a, 1
thief,, 1
and, 1
lately, 1
have, 1
become, 1
an, 1
assassin.", 1
A, 1
murmur,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
storm,, 1
of, 1
indignation, 1
burst, 1
from, 1
all, 1
parts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
assembly., 1
The, 1
judges, 1
themselves, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
stupefied,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
jury, 1
manifested, 1
tokens, 1
of, 1
disgust, 1
for, 1
cynicism, 1
so, 1
unexpected, 1
in, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
fashion., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
which,, 1
at, 1
first, 1
pale,, 1
had, 1
become, 1
red, 1
and, 1
burning;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
suddenly, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
lost, 1
his, 1
senses--he, 1
wanted, 1
air., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
anything,, 1
Mr., 1
Procureur?", 1
asked, 1
Benedetto,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
most, 1
ingratiating, 1
smile., 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
answered, 1
nothing,, 1
but, 1
sat,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
down, 1
again, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
chair., 1
"And, 1
now,, 1
prisoner,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
consent, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
your, 1
name?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"The, 1
brutal, 1
affectation, 1
with, 1
which, 1
you, 1
have, 1
enumerated, 1
and, 1
classified, 1
your, 1
crimes, 1
calls, 1
for, 1
a, 1
severe, 1
reprimand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
part, 1
of, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
both, 1
in, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
morality,, 1
and, 1
for, 1
the, 1
respect, 1
due, 1
to, 1
humanity., 1
You, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
consider, 1
this, 1
a, 1
point, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
may, 1
be, 1
for, 1
this, 1
reason,, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
delayed, 1
acknowledging, 1
your, 1
name., 1
You, 1
wished, 1
it, 1
to, 1
be, 1
preceded, 1
by, 1
all, 1
these, 1
titles.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
wonderful,, 1
Mr., 1
President,, 1
how, 1
entirely, 1
you, 1
have, 1
read, 1
my, 1
thoughts,", 1
said, 1
Benedetto,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
softest, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
most, 1
polite, 1
manner., 1
"This, 1
is,, 1
indeed,, 1
the, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
I, 1
begged, 1
you, 1
to, 1
alter, 1
the, 1
order, 1
of, 1
the, 1
questions.", 1
The, 1
public, 1
astonishment, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
its, 1
height., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
deceit, 1
or, 1
bravado, 1
in, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
accused., 1
The, 1
audience, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
a, 1
startling, 1
revelation, 1
was, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
this, 1
ominous, 1
prelude., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president;, 1
"your, 1
name?", 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
my, 1
name,, 1
since, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
it;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
know, 1
my, 1
father's,, 1
and, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
it, 1
to, 1
you.", 1
A, 1
painful, 1
giddiness, 1
overwhelmed, 1
Villefort;, 1
great, 1
drops, 1
of, 1
acrid, 1
sweat, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
face, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
papers, 1
which, 1
he, 1
held, 1
in, 1
his, 1
convulsed, 1
hand., 1
"Repeat, 1
your, 1
father's, 1
name,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president., 1
Not, 1
a, 1
whisper,, 1
not, 1
a, 1
breath,, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
in, 1
that, 1
vast, 1
assembly;, 1
every, 1
one, 1
waited, 1
anxiously., 1
"My, 1
father, 1
is, 1
king's, 1
attorney,", 1
replied, 1
Andrea, 1
calmly., 1
"King's, 1
attorney?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
stupefied,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
noticing, 1
the, 1
agitation, 1
which, 1
spread, 1
over, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort;, 1
"king's, 1
attorney?", 1
"Yes;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
know, 1
his, 1
name,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
it,--he, 1
is, 1
named, 1
Villefort.", 1
The, 1
explosion,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
long, 1
restrained, 1
from, 1
a, 1
feeling, 1
of, 1
respect, 1
to, 1
the, 1
court, 1
of, 1
justice,, 1
now, 1
burst, 1
forth, 1
like, 1
thunder, 1
from, 1
the, 1
breasts, 1
of, 1
all, 1
present;, 1
the, 1
court, 1
itself, 1
did, 1
not, 1
seek, 1
to, 1
restrain, 1
the, 1
feelings, 1
of, 1
the, 1
audience., 1
The, 1
exclamations,, 1
the, 1
insults, 1
addressed, 1
to, 1
Benedetto,, 1
who, 1
remained, 1
perfectly, 1
unconcerned,, 1
the, 1
energetic, 1
gestures,, 1
the, 1
movement, 1
of, 1
the, 1
gendarmes,, 1
the, 1
sneers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scum, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd, 1
always, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
rise, 1
to, 1
the, 1
surface, 1
in, 1
case, 1
of, 1
any, 1
disturbance--all, 1
this, 1
lasted, 1
five, 1
minutes,, 1
before, 1
the, 1
door-keepers, 1
and, 1
magistrates, 1
were, 1
able, 1
to, 1
restore, 1
silence., 1
In, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
this, 1
tumult, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
president, 1
was, 1
heard, 1
to, 1
exclaim,--"Are, 1
you, 1
playing, 1
with, 1
justice,, 1
accused,, 1
and, 1
do, 1
you, 1
dare, 1
set, 1
your, 1
fellow-citizens, 1
an, 1
example, 1
of, 1
disorder, 1
which, 1
even, 1
in, 1
these, 1
times, 1
has, 1
never, 1
been, 1
equalled?", 1
Several, 1
persons, 1
hurried, 1
up, 1
to, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
who, 1
sat, 1
half, 1
bowed, 1
over, 1
in, 1
his, 1
chair,, 1
offering, 1
him, 1
consolation,, 1
encouragement,, 1
and, 1
protestations, 1
of, 1
zeal, 1
and, 1
sympathy., 1
Order, 1
was, 1
re-established, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hall,, 1
except, 1
that, 1
a, 1
few, 1
people, 1
still, 1
moved, 1
about, 1
and, 1
whispered, 1
to, 1
one, 1
another., 1
A, 1
lady,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
said,, 1
had, 1
just, 1
fainted;, 1
they, 1
had, 1
supplied, 1
her, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smelling-bottle,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
had, 1
recovered., 1
During, 1
the, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
tumult,, 1
Andrea, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
smiling, 1
face, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
assembly;, 1
then,, 1
leaning, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
oaken, 1
rail, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dock,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
most, 1
graceful, 1
attitude, 1
possible,, 1
he, 1
said:, 1
"Gentlemen,, 1
I, 1
assure, 1
you, 1
I, 1
had, 1
no, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
insulting, 1
the, 1
court,, 1
or, 1
of, 1
making, 1
a, 1
useless, 1
disturbance, 1
in, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
this, 1
honorable, 1
assembly., 1
They, 1
ask, 1
my, 1
age;, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
it., 1
They, 1
ask, 1
where, 1
I, 1
was, 1
born;, 1
I, 1
answer., 1
They, 1
ask, 1
my, 1
name,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
give, 1
it,, 1
since, 1
my, 1
parents, 1
abandoned, 1
me., 1
But, 1
though, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
give, 1
my, 1
own, 1
name,, 1
not, 1
possessing, 1
one,, 1
I, 1
can, 1
tell, 1
them, 1
my, 1
father's., 1
Now, 1
I, 1
repeat,, 1
my, 1
father, 1
is, 1
named, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
am, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
it.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
an, 1
energy,, 1
a, 1
conviction,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
sincerity, 1
in, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
which, 1
silenced, 1
the, 1
tumult., 1
All, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
turned, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
who, 1
sat, 1
as, 1
motionless, 1
as, 1
though, 1
a, 1
thunderbolt, 1
had, 1
changed, 1
him, 1
into, 1
a, 1
corpse., 1
"Gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
Andrea,, 1
commanding, 1
silence, 1
by, 1
his, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
manner;, 1
"I, 1
owe, 1
you, 1
the, 1
proofs, 1
and, 1
explanations, 1
of, 1
what, 1
I, 1
have, 1
said.", 1
"But,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
irritated, 1
president,, 1
"you, 1
called, 1
yourself, 1
Benedetto,, 1
declared, 1
yourself, 1
an, 1
orphan,, 1
and, 1
claimed, 1
Corsica, 1
as, 1
your, 1
country.", 1
"I, 1
said, 1
anything, 1
I, 1
pleased,, 1
in, 1
order, 1
that, 1
the, 1
solemn, 1
declaration, 1
I, 1
have, 1
just, 1
made, 1
should, 1
not, 1
be, 1
withheld,, 1
which, 1
otherwise, 1
would, 1
certainly, 1
have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
case., 1
I, 1
now, 1
repeat, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
born, 1
at, 1
Auteuil, 1
on, 1
the, 1
night, 1
of, 1
the, 1
27th, 1
of, 1
September,, 1
1817,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
for, 1
any, 1
further, 1
details?, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
them., 1
I, 1
was, 1
born, 1
in, 1
No., 1
28,, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Fontaine,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
room, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
red, 1
damask;, 1
my, 1
father, 1
took, 1
me, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
telling, 1
my, 1
mother, 1
I, 1
was, 1
dead,, 1
wrapped, 1
me, 1
in, 1
a, 1
napkin, 1
marked, 1
with, 1
an, 1
H, 1
and, 1
an, 1
N,, 1
and, 1
carried, 1
me, 1
into, 1
a, 1
garden,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
buried, 1
me, 1
alive.", 1
A, 1
shudder, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
the, 1
assembly, 1
when, 1
they, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
the, 1
confidence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
increased, 1
in, 1
proportion, 1
to, 1
the, 1
terror, 1
of, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort., 1
"But, 1
how, 1
have, 1
you, 1
become, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
all, 1
these, 1
details?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
Mr., 1
President., 1
A, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
sworn, 1
vengeance, 1
against, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
long, 1
watched, 1
his, 1
opportunity, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
him,, 1
had, 1
introduced, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
night, 1
into, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
in, 1
which, 1
my, 1
father, 1
buried, 1
me., 1
He, 1
was, 1
concealed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
thicket;, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
my, 1
father, 1
bury, 1
something, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
stabbed, 1
him;, 1
then, 1
thinking, 1
the, 1
deposit, 1
might, 1
contain, 1
some, 1
treasure, 1
he, 1
turned, 1
up, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
me, 1
still, 1
living., 1
The, 1
man, 1
carried, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
foundling, 1
asylum,, 1
where, 1
I, 1
was, 1
registered, 1
under, 1
the, 1
number, 1
37., 1
Three, 1
months, 1
afterwards,, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
travelled, 1
from, 1
Rogliano, 1
to, 1
Paris, 1
to, 1
fetch, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
having, 1
claimed, 1
me, 1
as, 1
her, 1
son,, 1
carried, 1
me, 1
away., 1
Thus,, 1
you, 1
see,, 1
though, 1
born, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
brought, 1
up, 1
in, 1
Corsica.", 1
There, 1
was, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
silence,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
one, 1
could, 1
have, 1
fancied, 1
the, 1
hall, 1
empty,, 1
so, 1
profound, 1
was, 1
the, 1
stillness., 1
"Proceed,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"Certainly,, 1
I, 1
might, 1
have, 1
lived, 1
happily, 1
amongst, 1
those, 1
good, 1
people,, 1
who, 1
adored, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
my, 1
perverse, 1
disposition, 1
prevailed, 1
over, 1
the, 1
virtues, 1
which, 1
my, 1
adopted, 1
mother, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
instil, 1
into, 1
my, 1
heart., 1
I, 1
increased, 1
in, 1
wickedness, 1
till, 1
I, 1
committed, 1
crime., 1
One, 1
day, 1
when, 1
I, 1
cursed, 1
Providence, 1
for, 1
making, 1
me, 1
so, 1
wicked,, 1
and, 1
ordaining, 1
me, 1
to, 1
such, 1
a, 1
fate,, 1
my, 1
adopted, 1
father, 1
said, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
'Do, 1
not, 1
blaspheme,, 1
unhappy, 1
child,, 1
the, 1
crime, 1
is, 1
that, 1
of, 1
your, 1
father,, 1
not, 1
yours,--of, 1
your, 1
father,, 1

you, 1
to, 1
hell, 1

to, 1
misery, 1

a, 1
miracle, 1
preserved, 1
you, 1
alive.', 1
After, 1
that, 1
I, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
blaspheme,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
cursed, 1
my, 1
father., 1
That, 1
is, 1
why, 1
I, 1
have, 1
uttered, 1
the, 1
words, 1
for, 1
which, 1
you, 1
blame, 1
me;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
why, 1
I, 1
have, 1
filled, 1

with, 1
horror., 1

the, 1
day, 1
of, 1
my, 1
birth, 1

sad,, 1
bitter,, 1
and, 1
lamentable,, 1

pity, 1
me.", 1
"But, 1
your, 1

asked, 1
the, 1
president., 1
"My, 1
mother, 1
thought, 1
me, 1
dead;, 1

Just, 1
then, 1
a, 1
piercing, 1
cry,, 1
ending, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sob,, 1
burst, 1
from, 1
the, 1
centre, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
who, 1
encircled, 1
the, 1
lady, 1
who, 1
had, 1
before, 1
fainted,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
now, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
fit, 1
of, 1
hysterics., 1
She, 1
was, 1
carried, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hall,, 1
the, 1
thick, 1
veil, 1
which, 1
concealed, 1
her, 1
face, 1
dropped, 1
off,, 1

Madame, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
recognized., 1
Notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
shattered, 1
nerves,, 1
the, 1
ringing, 1
sensation, 1
in, 1
his, 1
ears,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
madness, 1
which, 1
turned, 1
his, 1
brain,, 1
Villefort, 1
rose, 1
as, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
her., 1
"The, 1
proofs,, 1

said, 1
the, 1
president;, 1
"remember, 1

"Yes.", 1

turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
who,, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
bear, 1
the, 1
universal, 1
gaze, 1
now, 1
riveted, 1
on, 1
him, 1
alone,, 1
advanced, 1
staggering, 1
into, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tribunal,, 1
with, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
dishevelled, 1
and, 1
his, 1
face, 1
indented, 1
with, 1
the, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
his, 1
nails., 1
The, 1
whole, 1
assembly, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
long, 1
murmur, 1
of, 1
astonishment., 1
"Father,", 1
said, 1
Benedetto,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
proofs,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
me, 1
to, 1
give, 1
them?", 1
"No,, 1
no,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
useless,", 1
stammered, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
in, 1
a, 1
hoarse, 1
voice;, 1
"no,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
useless!", 1
"How, 1
useless?", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
I, 1
feel, 1
it, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
struggle, 1
against, 1
this, 1
deadly, 1
weight, 1
which, 1
crushes, 1
me., 1
Gentlemen,, 1
I, 1
know, 1
I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
an, 1
avenging, 1
God!, 1
We, 1
need, 1
no, 1
proofs;, 1
everything, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
this, 1
young, 1
man, 1
is, 1
true.", 1
A, 1
dull,, 1
gloomy, 1
silence,, 1
like, 1
that, 1
which, 1
precedes, 1
some, 1
awful, 1
phenomenon, 1
of, 1
nature,, 1
pervaded, 1
the, 1
assembly,, 1
who, 1
shuddered, 1
in, 1
dismay., 1
"What,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort,", 1
cried, 1
the, 1
president,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
yield, 1
to, 1
an, 1
hallucination?, 1
What,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
your, 1
senses?, 1
This, 1
strange,, 1
unexpected,, 1
terrible, 1
accusation, 1
has, 1
disordered, 1
your, 1
reason., 1
Come,, 1
recover.", 1
The, 1
procureur, 1
dropped, 1
his, 1
head;, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
chattered, 1
like, 1
those, 1
of, 1
a, 1
man, 1
under, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
attack, 1
of, 1
fever,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
he, 1
was, 1
deadly, 1
pale., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
all, 1
my, 1
senses,, 1
sir,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"my, 1
body, 1
alone, 1
suffers,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
may, 1
suppose., 1
I, 1
acknowledge, 1
myself, 1
guilty, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
has, 1
brought, 1
against, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
this, 1
hour, 1
hold, 1
myself, 1
under, 1
the, 1
authority, 1
of, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
who, 1
will, 1
succeed, 1
me.", 1
And, 1
as, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
a, 1
hoarse,, 1
choking, 1
voice,, 1
he, 1
staggered, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
mechanically, 1
opened, 1
by, 1
a, 1
door-keeper., 1
The, 1
whole, 1
assembly, 1
were, 1
dumb, 1
with, 1
astonishment, 1
at, 1
the, 1
revelation, 1
and, 1
confession, 1
which, 1
had, 1
produced, 1
a, 1
catastrophe, 1
so, 1
different, 1
from, 1
that, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
expected, 1
during, 1
the, 1
last, 1
fortnight, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Parisian, 1
world., 1
"Well,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp,, 1
"let, 1
them, 1
now, 1
say, 1
that, 1
drama, 1
is, 1
unnatural!", 1
"Ma, 1
foi!", 1
said, 1
Chateau-Renaud,, 1
"I, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
end, 1
my, 1
career, 1
like, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Morcerf;, 1
a, 1
pistol-shot, 1
seems, 1
quite, 1
delightful, 1
compared, 1
with, 1
this, 1
catastrophe.", 1
"And, 1
moreover,, 1
it, 1
kills,", 1
said, 1
Beauchamp., 1
"And, 1
to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
I, 1
had, 1
an, 1
idea, 1
of, 1
marrying, 1
his, 1
daughter,", 1
said, 1
Debray., 1
"She, 1
did, 1
well, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
poor, 1
girl!", 1
"The, 1
sitting, 1
is, 1
adjourned,, 1
gentlemen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
president;, 1
"fresh, 1
inquiries, 1
will, 1
be, 1
made,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
case, 1
will, 1
be, 1
tried, 1
next, 1
session, 1
by, 1
another, 1
magistrate.", 1
As, 1
for, 1
Andrea,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
more, 1
interesting, 1
than, 1
ever,, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
hall,, 1
escorted, 1
by, 1
gendarmes,, 1
who, 1
involuntarily, 1
paid, 1
him, 1
some, 1
attention., 1
"Well,, 1
what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
of, 1
this,, 1
my, 1
fine, 1
fellow?", 1
asked, 1
Debray, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sergeant-at-arms,, 1
slipping, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
into, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"There, 1
will, 1
be, 1
extenuating, 1
circumstances,", 1
he, 1
replied., 1
Chapter, 1
111., 1
Expiation., 1
Notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
density, 1
of, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
saw, 1
it, 1
open, 1
before, 1
him., 1
There, 1
is, 1
something, 1
so, 1
awe-inspiring, 1
in, 1
great, 1
afflictions, 1
that, 1
even, 1
in, 1
the, 1
worst, 1
times, 1
the, 1
first, 1
emotion, 1
of, 1
a, 1
crowd, 1
has, 1
generally, 1
been, 1
to, 1
sympathize, 1
with, 1
the, 1
sufferer, 1
in, 1
a, 1
great, 1
catastrophe., 1
Many, 1
people, 1
have, 1
been, 1
assassinated, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tumult,, 1
but, 1
even, 1
criminals, 1
have, 1
rarely, 1
been, 1
insulted, 1
during, 1
trial., 1
Thus, 1
Villefort, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
spectators, 1
and, 1
officers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Palais,, 1
and, 1
withdrew., 1
Though, 1
he, 1
had, 1
acknowledged, 1
his, 1
guilt,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
protected, 1
by, 1
his, 1
grief., 1
There, 1
are, 1
some, 1
situations, 1
which, 1
men, 1
understand, 1
by, 1
instinct,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
reason, 1
is, 1
powerless, 1
to, 1
explain;, 1
in, 1
such, 1
cases, 1
the, 1
greatest, 1
poet, 1
is, 1
he, 1
who, 1
gives, 1
utterance, 1
to, 1
the, 1
most, 1
natural, 1
and, 1
vehement, 1
outburst, 1
of, 1
sorrow., 1
Those, 1
who, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
bitter, 1
cry, 1
are, 1
as, 1
much, 1
impressed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
they, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
an, 1
entire, 1
poem,, 1
and, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sufferer, 1
is, 1
sincere, 1
they, 1
are, 1
right, 1
in, 1
regarding, 1
his, 1
outburst, 1
as, 1
sublime., 1
It, 1
would, 1
be, 1
difficult, 1
to, 1
describe, 1
the, 1
state, 1
of, 1
stupor, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Villefort, 1
left, 1
the, 1
Palais., 1
Every, 1
pulse, 1
beat, 1
with, 1
feverish, 1
excitement,, 1
every, 1
nerve, 1
was, 1
strained,, 1
every, 1
vein, 1
swollen,, 1
and, 1
every, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
body, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
suffer, 1
distinctly, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
thus, 1
multiplying, 1
his, 1
agony, 1
a, 1
thousand-fold., 1
He, 1
made, 1
his, 1
way, 1
along, 1
the, 1
corridors, 1
through, 1
force, 1
of, 1
habit;, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
aside, 1
his, 1
magisterial, 1
robe,, 1
not, 1
out, 1
of, 1
deference, 1
to, 1
etiquette,, 1
but, 1
because, 1
it, 1
was, 1
an, 1
unbearable, 1
burden,, 1
a, 1
veritable, 1
garb, 1
of, 1
Nessus,, 1
insatiate, 1
in, 1
torture., 1
Having, 1
staggered, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Dauphine,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
his, 1
carriage,, 1
awoke, 1
his, 1
sleeping, 1
coachman, 1
by, 1
opening, 1
the, 1
door, 1
himself,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
cushions,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Faubourg, 1
Saint-Honore;, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
drove, 1
on., 1
The, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fallen, 1
fortunes, 1
seemed, 1
suddenly, 1
to, 1
crush, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
foresee, 1
the, 1
consequences;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
contemplate, 1
the, 1
future, 1
with, 1
the, 1
indifference, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hardened, 1
criminal, 1
who, 1
merely, 1
faces, 1
a, 1
contingency, 1
already, 1
familiar., 1
God, 1
was, 1
still, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"God,", 1
he, 1
murmured,, 1
not, 1
knowing, 1
what, 1
he, 1
said,--"God--God!", 1
Behind, 1
the, 1
event, 1
that, 1
had, 1
overwhelmed, 1
him, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
God., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
rapidly, 1
onward., 1
Villefort,, 1
while, 1
turning, 1
restlessly, 1
on, 1
the, 1
cushions,, 1
felt, 1
something, 1
press, 1
against, 1
him., 1
He, 1
put, 1
out, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
remove, 1
the, 1
object;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
fan, 1
which, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
had, 1
left, 1
in, 1
the, 1
carriage;, 1
this, 1
fan, 1
awakened, 1
a, 1
recollection, 1
which, 1
darted, 1
through, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
like, 1
lightning., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife., 1
"Oh!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
a, 1
redhot, 1
iron, 1
were, 1
piercing, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
During, 1
the, 1
last, 1
hour, 1
his, 1
own, 1
crime, 1
had, 1
alone, 1
been, 1
presented, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mind;, 1
now, 1
another, 1
object,, 1
not, 1
less, 1
terrible,, 1
suddenly, 1
presented, 1
itself., 1
His, 1
wife!, 1
He, 1
had, 1
just, 1
acted, 1
the, 1
inexorable, 1
judge, 1
with, 1
her,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
condemned, 1
her, 1
to, 1
death,, 1
and, 1
she,, 1
crushed, 1
by, 1
remorse,, 1
struck, 1
with, 1
terror,, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
the, 1
shame, 1
inspired, 1
by, 1
the, 1
eloquence, 1
of, 1
his, 1
irreproachable, 1
virtue,--she,, 1
a, 1
poor,, 1
weak, 1
woman,, 1
without, 1
help, 1
or, 1
the, 1
power, 1
of, 1
defending, 1
herself, 1
against, 1
his, 1
absolute, 1
and, 1
supreme, 1
will,--she, 1
might, 1
at, 1
that, 1
very, 1
moment,, 1
perhaps,, 1
be, 1
preparing, 1
to, 1
die!, 1
An, 1
hour, 1
had, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
her, 1
condemnation;, 1
at, 1
that, 1
moment,, 1
doubtless,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
recalling, 1
all, 1
her, 1
crimes, 1
to, 1
her, 1
memory;, 1
she, 1
was, 1
asking, 1
pardon, 1
for, 1
her, 1
sins;, 1
perhaps, 1
she, 1
was, 1
even, 1
writing, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
imploring, 1
forgiveness, 1
from, 1
her, 1
virtuous, 1
husband--a, 1
forgiveness, 1
she, 1
was, 1
purchasing, 1
with, 1
her, 1
death!, 1
Villefort, 1
again, 1
groaned, 1
with, 1
anguish, 1
and, 1
despair., 1
"Ah,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"that, 1
woman, 1
became, 1
criminal, 1
only, 1
from, 1
associating, 1
with, 1
me!, 1
I, 1
carried, 1
the, 1
infection, 1
of, 1
crime, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
she, 1
has, 1
caught, 1
it, 1
as, 1
she, 1
would, 1
the, 1
typhus, 1
fever,, 1
the, 1
cholera,, 1
the, 1
plague!, 1
And, 1
yet, 1
I, 1
have, 1
punished, 1
her--I, 1
have, 1
dared, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
her--I, 1
have--'Repent, 1
and, 1
die!', 1
But, 1
no,, 1
she, 1
must, 1
not, 1
die;, 1
she, 1
shall, 1
live,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
me., 1
We, 1
will, 1
flee, 1
from, 1
Paris, 1
and, 1
go, 1
as, 1
far, 1
as, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
reaches., 1
I, 1
told, 1
her, 1
of, 1
the, 1
scaffold;, 1
oh,, 1
heavens,, 1
I, 1
forgot, 1
that, 1
it, 1
awaits, 1
me, 1
also!, 1
How, 1
could, 1
I, 1
pronounce, 1
that, 1
word?, 1
Yes,, 1
we, 1
will, 1
fly;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
confess, 1
all, 1
to, 1
her,--I, 1
will, 1
tell, 1
her, 1
daily, 1
that, 1
I, 1
also, 1
have, 1
committed, 1
a, 1
crime!--Oh,, 1
what, 1
an, 1
alliance--the, 1
tiger, 1
and, 1
the, 1
serpent;, 1
worthy, 1
wife, 1
of, 1
such, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am!, 1
She, 1
must, 1
live, 1
that, 1
my, 1
infamy, 1
may, 1
diminish, 1
hers.", 1
And, 1
Villefort, 1
dashed, 1
open, 1
the, 1
window, 1
in, 1
front, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Faster,, 1
faster!", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
which, 1
electrified, 1
the, 1
coachman., 1
The, 1
horses,, 1
impelled, 1
by, 1
fear,, 1
flew, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
house., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
repeated, 1
Villefort,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
his, 1
home--"yes,, 1
that, 1
woman, 1
must, 1
live;, 1
she, 1
must, 1
repent,, 1
and, 1
educate, 1
my, 1
son,, 1
the, 1
sole, 1
survivor,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
exception, 1
of, 1
the, 1
indestructible, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
wreck, 1
of, 1
my, 1
house., 1
She, 1
loves, 1
him;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
his, 1
sake, 1
she, 1
has, 1
committed, 1
these, 1
crimes., 1
We, 1
ought, 1
never, 1
to, 1
despair, 1
of, 1
softening, 1
the, 1
heart, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mother, 1
who, 1
loves, 1
her, 1
child., 1
She, 1
will, 1
repent,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
will, 1
know, 1
that, 1
she, 1
has, 1
been, 1
guilty., 1
The, 1
events, 1
which, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
in, 1
my, 1
house,, 1
though, 1
they, 1
now, 1
occupy, 1
the, 1
public, 1
mind,, 1
will, 1
be, 1
forgotten, 1
in, 1
time,, 1
or, 1
if,, 1
indeed,, 1
a, 1
few, 1
enemies, 1
should, 1
persist, 1
in, 1
remembering, 1
them,, 1
why, 1
then, 1
I, 1
will, 1
add, 1
them, 1
to, 1
my, 1
list, 1
of, 1
crimes., 1
What, 1
will, 1
it, 1
signify, 1
if, 1
one,, 1
two,, 1
or, 1
three, 1
more, 1
are, 1
added?, 1
My, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
child, 1
shall, 1
escape, 1
from, 1
this, 1
gulf,, 1
carrying, 1
treasures, 1
with, 1
them;, 1
she, 1
will, 1
live, 1
and, 1
may, 1
yet, 1
be, 1
happy,, 1
since, 1
her, 1
child,, 1
in, 1
whom, 1
all, 1
her, 1
love, 1
is, 1
centred,, 1
will, 1
be, 1
with, 1
her., 1
I, 1
shall, 1
have, 1
performed, 1
a, 1
good, 1
action,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
heart, 1
will, 1
be, 1
lighter.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
procureur, 1
breathed, 1
more, 1
freely, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house., 1
Villefort, 1
leaped, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
and, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
his, 1
servants, 1
were, 1
surprised, 1
at, 1
his, 1
early, 1
return;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
read, 1
no, 1
other, 1
expression, 1
on, 1
their, 1
features., 1
Neither, 1
of, 1
them, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
they, 1
merely, 1
stood, 1
aside, 1
to, 1
let, 1
him, 1
pass, 1
by,, 1
as, 1
usual,, 1
nothing, 1
more., 1
As, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
M., 1
Noirtier's, 1
room,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
two, 1
figures, 1
through, 1
the, 1
half-open, 1
door;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
experienced, 1
no, 1
curiosity, 1
to, 1
know, 1
who, 1
was, 1
visiting, 1
his, 1
father:, 1
anxiety, 1
carried, 1
him, 1
on, 1
further., 1
"Come,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
ascended, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
room,, 1
"nothing, 1
is, 1
changed, 1
here.", 1
He, 1
then, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
landing., 1
"No, 1
one, 1
must, 1
disturb, 1
us,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
speak, 1
freely, 1
to, 1
her,, 1
accuse, 1
myself,, 1
and, 1
say"--he, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
crystal, 1
handle,, 1
which, 1
yielded, 1
to, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Not, 1
locked,", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"that, 1
is, 1
well.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
little, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Edward, 1
slept;, 1
for, 1
though, 1
the, 1
child, 1
went, 1
to, 1
school, 1
during, 1
the, 1
day,, 1
his, 1
mother, 1
could, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
him, 1
to, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
from, 1
her, 1
at, 1
night., 1
With, 1
a, 1
single, 1
glance, 1
Villefort's, 1
eye, 1
ran, 1
through, 1
the, 1
room., 1
"Not, 1
here,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"doubtless, 1
she, 1
is, 1
in, 1
her, 1
bedroom.", 1
He, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
found, 1
it, 1
bolted,, 1
and, 1
stopped,, 1
shuddering., 1
"Heloise!", 1
he, 1
cried., 1
He, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
furniture, 1
being, 1
removed., 1
"Heloise!", 1
he, 1
repeated., 1
"Who, 1
is, 1
there?", 1
answered, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
her, 1
he, 1
sought., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
that, 1
voice, 1
more, 1
feeble, 1
than, 1
usual., 1
"Open, 1
the, 1
door!", 1
cried, 1
Villefort., 1
"Open;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
I.", 1
But, 1
notwithstanding, 1
this, 1
request,, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
anguish, 1
in, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
uttered,, 1
the, 1
door, 1
remained, 1
closed., 1
Villefort, 1
burst, 1
it, 1
open, 1
with, 1
a, 1
violent, 1
blow., 1
At, 1
the, 1
entrance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
which, 1
led, 1
to, 1
her, 1
boudoir,, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
erect,, 1
pale,, 1
her, 1
features, 1
contracted,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
eyes, 1
glaring, 1
horribly., 1
"Heloise,, 1
Heloise!", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"what, 1
is, 1
the, 1
matter?, 1
Speak!", 1
The, 1
young, 1
woman, 1
extended, 1
her, 1
stiff, 1
white, 1
hands, 1
towards, 1
him., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
done,, 1
monsieur,", 1
she, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
rattling, 1
noise, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
tear, 1
her, 1
throat., 1
"What, 1
more, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
and, 1
she, 1
fell, 1
full, 1
length, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor., 1
Villefort, 1
ran, 1
to, 1
her, 1
and, 1
seized, 1
her, 1
hand,, 1
which, 1
convulsively, 1
clasped, 1
a, 1
crystal, 1
bottle, 1
with, 1
a, 1
golden, 1
stopper., 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
Villefort,, 1
maddened, 1
with, 1
horror,, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
to, 1
the, 1
threshhold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
corpse:, 1
"My, 1
son!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed, 1
suddenly,, 1
"where, 1
is, 1
my, 1
son?--Edward,, 1
Edward!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
still, 1
crying,, 1
"Edward,, 1
Edward!", 1
The, 1
name, 1
was, 1
pronounced, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
anguish, 1
that, 1
the, 1
servants, 1
ran, 1
up., 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
my, 1
son?", 1
asked, 1
Villefort;, 1
"let, 1
him, 1
be, 1
removed, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
may, 1
not, 1
see"--, 1
"Master, 1
Edward, 1
is, 1
not, 1
down-stairs,, 1
sir,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
valet., 1
"Then, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
playing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
garden;, 1
go, 1
and, 1
see.", 1
"No,, 1
sir;, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
him, 1
half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
ago;, 1
he, 1
went, 1
into, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
and, 1
has, 1
not, 1
been, 1
down-stairs, 1
since.", 1
A, 1
cold, 1
perspiration, 1
burst, 1
out, 1
on, 1
Villefort's, 1
brow;, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
trembled,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
thoughts, 1
flew, 1
about, 1
madly, 1
in, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
like, 1
the, 1
wheels, 1
of, 1
a, 1
disordered, 1
watch., 1
"In, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort's, 1
room?", 1
he, 1
murmured, 1
and, 1
slowly, 1
returned,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
wiping, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
the, 1
other, 1
supporting, 1
himself, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
To, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
room, 1
he, 1
must, 1
again, 1
see, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
his, 1
unfortunate, 1
wife., 1
To, 1
call, 1
Edward, 1
he, 1
must, 1
reawaken, 1
the, 1
echo, 1
of, 1
that, 1
room, 1
which, 1
now, 1
appeared, 1
like, 1
a, 1
sepulchre;, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
violating, 1
the, 1
silence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tomb., 1
His, 1
tongue, 1
was, 1
paralyzed, 1
in, 1
his, 1
mouth., 1
"Edward!", 1
he, 1
stammered--"Edward!", 1
The, 1
child, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
Where,, 1
then,, 1
could, 1
he, 1
be,, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
mother's, 1
room, 1
and, 1
not, 1
since, 1
returned?, 1
He, 1
stepped, 1
forward., 1
The, 1
corpse, 1
of, 1
Madame, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
stretched, 1
across, 1
the, 1
doorway, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Edward, 1
must, 1
be;, 1
those, 1
glaring, 1
eyes, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
the, 1
threshold,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
lips, 1
bore, 1
the, 1
stamp, 1
of, 1
a, 1
terrible, 1
and, 1
mysterious, 1
irony., 1
Through, 1
the, 1
open, 1
door, 1
was, 1
visible, 1
a, 1
portion, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boudoir,, 1
containing, 1
an, 1
upright, 1
piano, 1
and, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
satin, 1
couch., 1
Villefort, 1
stepped, 1
forward, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
paces,, 1
and, 1
beheld, 1
his, 1
child, 1
lying--no, 1
doubt, 1
asleep--on, 1
the, 1
sofa., 1
The, 1
unhappy, 1
man, 1
uttered, 1
an, 1
exclamation, 1
of, 1
joy;, 1
a, 1
ray, 1
of, 1
light, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
the, 1
abyss, 1
of, 1
despair, 1
and, 1
darkness., 1
He, 1
had, 1
only, 1
to, 1
step, 1
over, 1
the, 1
corpse,, 1
enter, 1
the, 1
boudoir,, 1
take, 1
the, 1
child, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
flee, 1
far,, 1
far, 1
away., 1
Villefort, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
the, 1
civilized, 1
man;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tiger, 1
hurt, 1
unto, 1
death,, 1
gnashing, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
in, 1
his, 1
wound., 1
He, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
feared, 1
realities,, 1
but, 1
phantoms., 1
He, 1
leaped, 1
over, 1
the, 1
corpse, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
burning, 1
brazier., 1
He, 1
took, 1
the, 1
child, 1
in, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
embraced, 1
him,, 1
shook, 1
him,, 1
called, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
child, 1
made, 1
no, 1
response., 1
He, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
burning, 1
lips, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cheeks,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
icy, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
pale;, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
stiffened, 1
limbs;, 1
he, 1
pressed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
heart,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
beat,--the, 1
child, 1
was, 1
dead., 1
A, 1
folded, 1
paper, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
Edward's, 1
breast., 1
Villefort,, 1
thunderstruck,, 1
fell, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
knees;, 1
the, 1
child, 1
dropped, 1
from, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
rolled, 1
on, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
its, 1
mother., 1
He, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
the, 1
paper,, 1
and,, 1
recognizing, 1
his, 1
wife's, 1
writing,, 1
ran, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
rapidly, 1
over, 1
its, 1
contents;, 1
it, 1
ran, 1
as, 1
follows:--, 1
"You, 1
know, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
a, 1
good, 1
mother,, 1
since, 1
it, 1
was, 1
for, 1
my, 1
son's, 1
sake, 1
I, 1
became, 1
criminal., 1
A, 1
good, 1
mother, 1
cannot, 1
depart, 1
without, 1
her, 1
son.", 1
Villefort, 1
could, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
his, 1
eyes,--he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
his, 1
reason;, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
himself, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
child's, 1
body,, 1
and, 1
examined, 1
it, 1
as, 1
a, 1
lioness, 1
contemplates, 1
its, 1
dead, 1
cub., 1
Then, 1
a, 1
piercing, 1
cry, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
his, 1
breast,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"Still, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
God.", 1
The, 1
presence, 1
of, 1
the, 1
two, 1
victims, 1
alarmed, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
bear, 1
solitude, 1
shared, 1
only, 1
by, 1
two, 1
corpses., 1
Until, 1
then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
sustained, 1
by, 1
rage,, 1
by, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
of, 1
mind,, 1
by, 1
despair,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
supreme, 1
agony, 1
which, 1
led, 1
the, 1
Titans, 1
to, 1
scale, 1
the, 1
heavens,, 1
and, 1
Ajax, 1
to, 1
defy, 1
the, 1
gods., 1
He, 1
now, 1
arose,, 1
his, 1
head, 1
bowed, 1
beneath, 1
the, 1
weight, 1
of, 1
grief,, 1
and,, 1
shaking, 1
his, 1
damp,, 1
dishevelled, 1
hair,, 1
he, 1
who, 1
had, 1
never, 1
felt, 1
compassion, 1
for, 1
any, 1
one, 1
determined, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
some, 1
one, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
could, 1
relate, 1
his, 1
misfortunes,--some, 1
one, 1
by, 1
whose, 1
side, 1
he, 1
might, 1
weep., 1
He, 1
descended, 1
the, 1
little, 1
staircase, 1
with, 1
which, 1
we, 1
are, 1
acquainted,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
Noirtier's, 1
room., 1
The, 1
old, 1
man, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
be, 1
listening, 1
attentively, 1
and, 1
as, 1
affectionately, 1
as, 1
his, 1
infirmities, 1
would, 1
allow, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni,, 1
who, 1
looked, 1
cold, 1
and, 1
calm,, 1
as, 1
usual., 1
Villefort,, 1
perceiving, 1
the, 1
abbe,, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
across, 1
his, 1
brow., 1
He, 1
recollected, 1
the, 1
call, 1
he, 1
had, 1
made, 1
upon, 1
him, 1
after, 1
the, 1
dinner, 1
at, 1
Auteuil,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
the, 1
visit, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
had, 1
himself, 1
paid, 1
to, 1
his, 1
house, 1
on, 1
the, 1
day, 1
of, 1
Valentine's, 1
death., 1
"You, 1
here,, 1
sir!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed;, 1
"do, 1
you,, 1
then,, 1
never, 1
appear, 1
but, 1
to, 1
act, 1
as, 1
an, 1
escort, 1
to, 1
death?", 1
Busoni, 1
turned, 1
around,, 1
and,, 1
perceiving, 1
the, 1
excitement, 1
depicted, 1
on, 1
the, 1
magistrate's, 1
face,, 1
the, 1
savage, 1
lustre, 1
of, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
the, 1
revelation, 1
had, 1
been, 1
made, 1
at, 1
the, 1
assizes;, 1
but, 1
beyond, 1
this, 1
he, 1
was, 1
ignorant., 1
"I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
pray, 1
over, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
your, 1
daughter.", 1
"And, 1
now, 1
why, 1
are, 1
you, 1
here?", 1
"I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
that, 1
you, 1
have, 1
sufficiently, 1
repaid, 1
your, 1
debt,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
from, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
I, 1
will, 1
pray, 1
to, 1
God, 1
to, 1
forgive, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
do.", 1
"Good, 1
heavens!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Villefort,, 1
stepping, 1
back, 1
fearfully,, 1
"surely, 1
that, 1
is, 1
not, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Busoni!", 1
"No!", 1
The, 1
abbe, 1
threw, 1
off, 1
his, 1
wig,, 1
shook, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
hair,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
confined,, 1
fell, 1
in, 1
black, 1
masses, 1
around, 1
his, 1
manly, 1
face., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
procureur,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
haggard, 1
expression., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
not, 1
exactly, 1
right,, 1
M., 1
Procureur;, 1
you, 1
must, 1
go, 1

voice,, 1
that, 1

it?", 1

heard, 1
it, 1

at, 1
Marseilles,, 1
twenty-three, 1
years, 1
ago,, 1

chest;, 1

what, 1

I, 1
done, 1
to, 1

exclaimed, 1
Villefort,, 1
whose, 1
mind, 1
was, 1
balancing, 1
between, 1
reason, 1
and, 1
insanity,, 1
in, 1
that, 1
cloud, 1
which, 1
is, 1
neither, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
nor, 1
reality;, 1
"what, 1

Speak!", 1
"You, 1
condemned, 1
me, 1
to, 1
a, 1
horrible,, 1
tedious, 1

at, 1

from, 1

enriched, 1
him, 1
with, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
diamonds,, 1

led, 1
him, 1
to, 1
you!", 1
"Ah,, 1
I, 1
recognize, 1
you--I, 1
recognize, 1
you!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
king's, 1
attorney;, 1
"you, 1

"I, 1
am, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes!", 1
"You, 1

Villefort,, 1
seizing, 1
the, 1
count, 1
by, 1
the, 1
wrist;, 1
"then, 1
come, 1
here!", 1
And, 1
up, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
who,, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
what, 1
had, 1
happened,, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
in, 1
astonishment,, 1
foreseeing, 1
some, 1
new, 1
catastrophe., 1
"There,, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes!", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
bodies, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
and, 1
child,, 1
"see,, 1
are, 1
you, 1
well, 1
avenged?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
became, 1
pale, 1
at, 1
this, 1
horrible, 1
sight;, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
beyond, 1
the, 1
bounds, 1
of, 1
vengeance,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
could, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
say,, 1
"God, 1
is, 1
for, 1
and, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
With, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
indescribable, 1
anguish, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
reopened, 1
its, 1
eyes,, 1
felt, 1
its, 1
pulse,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
rushed, 1
with, 1
him, 1
into, 1
Valentine's, 1
room,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
double-locked, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"My, 1
child,", 1
cried, 1
Villefort,, 1
"he, 1
carries, 1
away, 1
the, 1
body, 1
of, 1
my, 1
child!, 1
Oh,, 1
curses,, 1
woe,, 1
death, 1
to, 1
you!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
tried, 1
to, 1
follow, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
though, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream, 1
he, 1
was, 1
transfixed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
spot,--his, 1
eyes, 1
glared, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
were, 1
starting, 1
through, 1
the, 1
sockets;, 1
he, 1
griped, 1
the, 1
flesh, 1
on, 1
his, 1
chest, 1
until, 1
his, 1
nails, 1
were, 1
stained, 1
with, 1
blood;, 1
the, 1
veins, 1
of, 1
his, 1
temples, 1
swelled, 1
and, 1
boiled, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
would, 1
burst, 1
their, 1
narrow, 1
boundary,, 1
and, 1
deluge, 1
his, 1
brain, 1
with, 1
living, 1
fire., 1
This, 1
lasted, 1
several, 1
minutes,, 1
until, 1
the, 1
frightful, 1
overturn, 1
of, 1
reason, 1
was, 1
accomplished;, 1
then, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
cry, 1
followed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
burst, 1
of, 1
laughter,, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
down, 1
the, 1
stairs., 1
A, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
Valentine's, 1
room, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
reappeared., 1
Pale,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
dull, 1
eye, 1
and, 1
heavy, 1
heart,, 1
all, 1
the, 1
noble, 1
features, 1
of, 1
that, 1
face,, 1
usually, 1
so, 1
calm, 1
and, 1
serene,, 1
were, 1
overcast, 1
by, 1
grief., 1
In, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
he, 1
held, 1
the, 1
child,, 1
whom, 1
no, 1
skill, 1
had, 1
been, 1
able, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
to, 1
life., 1
Bending, 1
on, 1
one, 1
knee,, 1
he, 1
placed, 1
it, 1
reverently, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
its, 1
mother,, 1
with, 1
its, 1
head, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
breast., 1
Then,, 1
rising,, 1
he, 1
went, 1
out,, 1
and, 1
meeting, 1
a, 1
servant, 1
on, 1
the, 1
stairs,, 1
he, 1
asked,, 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
M., 1
de, 1
Villefort?", 1
The, 1
servant,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
answering,, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
garden., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
ran, 1
down, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
and, 1
advancing, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
designated, 1
beheld, 1
Villefort,, 1
encircled, 1
by, 1
his, 1
servants,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
spade, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
digging, 1
the, 1
earth, 1
with, 1
fury., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here!", 1
he, 1
cried., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here!", 1
And, 1
then, 1
he, 1
moved, 1
farther, 1
on,, 1
and, 1
began, 1
again, 1
to, 1
dig., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
approached, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
said, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
almost, 1
humble,, 1
"Sir,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
indeed, 1
lost, 1
a, 1
son;, 1
but"--, 1
Villefort, 1
interrupted, 1
him;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
neither, 1
listened, 1
nor, 1
heard., 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
will, 1
find, 1
it,", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"you, 1
may, 1
pretend, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
here,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
will, 1
find, 1
him,, 1
though, 1
I, 1
dig, 1
forever!", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
drew, 1
back, 1
in, 1
horror., 1
"Oh,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"he, 1
is, 1
mad!", 1
And, 1
as, 1
though, 1
he, 1
feared, 1
that, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
of, 1
the, 1
accursed, 1
house, 1
would, 1
crumble, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
street,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
doubting, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
right, 1
to, 1
do, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done., 1
"Oh,, 1
enough, 1
of, 1
this,--enough, 1
of, 1
this,", 1
he, 1
cried;, 1
"let, 1
me, 1
save, 1
the, 1
last.", 1
On, 1
entering, 1
his, 1
house,, 1
he, 1
met, 1
Morrel,, 1
who, 1
wandered, 1
about, 1
like, 1
a, 1
ghost, 1
awaiting, 1
the, 1
heavenly, 1
mandate, 1
for, 1
return, 1
to, 1
the, 1
tomb., 1
"Prepare, 1
yourself,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile;, 1
"we, 1
leave, 1
Paris, 1
to-morrow.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
nothing, 1
more, 1
to, 1
do, 1
there?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"God, 1
grant, 1
I, 1
may, 1
not, 1
have, 1
done, 1
too, 1
much, 1
already.", 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
they, 1
indeed, 1
left,, 1
accompanied, 1
only, 1
by, 1
Baptistin., 1
Haidee, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
away, 1
Ali,, 1
and, 1
Bertuccio, 1
remained, 1
with, 1
Noirtier., 1
Chapter, 1
112., 1
The, 1
Departure., 1
The, 1
recent, 1
event, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
theme, 1
of, 1
conversation, 1
throughout, 1
all, 1
Paris., 1
Emmanuel, 1
and, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
conversed, 1
with, 1
natural, 1
astonishment, 1
in, 1
their, 1
little, 1
apartment, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Meslay, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
three, 1
successive,, 1
sudden,, 1
and, 1
most, 1
unexpected, 1
catastrophes, 1
of, 1
Morcerf,, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
Villefort., 1
Maximilian,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
paying, 1
them, 1
a, 1
visit,, 1
listened, 1
to, 1
their, 1
conversation,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
was, 1
present, 1
at, 1
it,, 1
plunged, 1
in, 1
his, 1
accustomed, 1
state, 1
of, 1
apathy., 1
"Indeed,", 1
said, 1
Julie,, 1
"might, 1
we, 1
not, 1
almost, 1
fancy,, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
that, 1
those, 1
people,, 1
so, 1
rich,, 1
so, 1
happy, 1
but, 1
yesterday,, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
in, 1
their, 1
prosperity, 1
that, 1
an, 1
evil, 1
genius--like, 1
the, 1
wicked, 1
fairies, 1
in, 1
Perrault's, 1
stories, 1
who, 1
present, 1
themselves, 1
unbidden, 1
at, 1
a, 1
wedding, 1
or, 1
baptism--hovered, 1
over, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
appeared, 1
all, 1
at, 1
once, 1
to, 1
revenge, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
their, 1
fatal, 1
neglect?", 1
"What, 1
a, 1
dire, 1
misfortune!", 1
said, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
thinking, 1
of, 1
Morcerf, 1
and, 1
Danglars., 1
"What, 1
dreadful, 1
sufferings!", 1
said, 1
Julie,, 1
remembering, 1
Valentine,, 1
but, 1
whom,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
delicacy, 1
natural, 1
to, 1
women,, 1
she, 1
did, 1
not, 1
name, 1
before, 1
her, 1
brother., 1
"If, 1
the, 1
Supreme, 1
Being, 1
has, 1
directed, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
blow,", 1
said, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
"it, 1
must, 1
be, 1
that, 1
he, 1
in, 1
his, 1
great, 1
goodness, 1
has, 1
perceived, 1
nothing, 1
in, 1
the, 1
past, 1
lives, 1
of, 1
these, 1
people, 1
to, 1
merit, 1
mitigation, 1
of, 1
their, 1
awful, 1
punishment.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
form, 1
a, 1
very, 1
rash, 1
judgment,, 1
Emmanuel?", 1
said, 1
Julie., 1
"When, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
pistol, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
was, 1
once, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
committing, 1
suicide,, 1
had, 1
any, 1
one, 1
then, 1
said,, 1
'This, 1
man, 1
deserves, 1
his, 1
misery,', 1
would, 1
not, 1
that, 1
person, 1
have, 1
been, 1
deceived?", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
your, 1
father, 1
was, 1
not, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
fall., 1
A, 1
being, 1
was, 1
commissioned, 1
to, 1
arrest, 1
the, 1
fatal, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
death, 1
about, 1
to, 1
descend, 1
on, 1
him.", 1
Emmanuel, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words, 1
when, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bell, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
the, 1
well-known, 1
signal, 1
given, 1
by, 1
the, 1
porter, 1
that, 1
a, 1
visitor, 1
had, 1
arrived., 1
Nearly, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold., 1
The, 1
young, 1
people, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1
joy,, 1
while, 1
Maximilian, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
but, 1
let, 1
it, 1
fall, 1
again, 1
immediately., 1
"Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
without, 1
appearing, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
the, 1
different, 1
impressions, 1
which, 1
his, 1
presence, 1
produced, 1
on, 1
the, 1
little, 1
circle,, 1
"I, 1
come, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
you.", 1
"To, 1
seek, 1
me?", 1
repeated, 1
Morrel,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
awakening, 1
from, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"has, 1
it, 1
not, 1
been, 1
agreed, 1
that, 1
I, 1
should, 1
take, 1
you, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
and, 1
did, 1
I, 1
not, 1
tell, 1
you, 1
yesterday, 1
to, 1
prepare, 1
for, 1
departure?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
ready,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian;, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
expressly, 1
to, 1
wish, 1
them, 1
farewell.", 1
"Whither, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going,, 1
count?", 1
asked, 1
Julie., 1
"In, 1
the, 1
first, 1
instance, 1
to, 1
Marseilles,, 1
madame.", 1
"To, 1
Marseilles!", 1
exclaimed, 1
the, 1
young, 1
couple., 1
"Yes,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
take, 1
your, 1
brother, 1
with, 1
me.", 1
"Oh,, 1
count.", 1
said, 1
Julie,, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
restore, 1
him, 1
to, 1
us, 1
cured, 1
of, 1
his, 1
melancholy?"--Morrel, 1
turned, 1
away, 1
to, 1
conceal, 1
the, 1
confusion, 1
of, 1
his, 1
countenance., 1
"You, 1
perceive,, 1
then,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
is, 1
not, 1
happy?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Yes,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
young, 1
woman;, 1
"and, 1
fear, 1
much, 1
that, 1
he, 1
finds, 1
our, 1
home, 1

a, 1
dull, 1
one.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
undertake, 1
to, 1
divert, 1
him,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
ready, 1
to, 1
accompany, 1
you,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian., 1
"Adieu,, 1
my, 1
kind, 1
friends!, 1
Emmanuel--Julie--farewell!", 1
"How, 1
farewell?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Julie;, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
us, 1
thus,, 1
so, 1
suddenly,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
preparations, 1
for, 1
your, 1
journey,, 1
without, 1

a, 1
passport?", 1
"Needless, 1
delays, 1

increase, 1
the, 1
grief, 1
of, 1
parting,", 1

Cristo,, 1
"and, 1
Maximilian, 1
has, 1
doubtless, 1
provided, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
everything, 1

him, 1

Morrel, 1
in, 1
his, 1
tranquil, 1
but, 1
mournful, 1
manner., 1
"Good,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling;, 1
"in, 1
these, 1
prompt, 1

Julie,, 1
"at, 1
a, 1
moment's, 1
warning?, 1

us, 1
a, 1

an, 1

at, 1

Rome, 1
in, 1
five, 1
days.", 1
"But, 1
does, 1
Maximilian, 1
go, 1
to, 1
Rome?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Emmanuel., 1

am, 1
going, 1
wherever, 1
it, 1
may, 1

the, 1

Morrel,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
full, 1
of, 1
grief;, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
under, 1
his, 1
orders, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
month.", 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens,, 1
how, 1
strangely, 1
he, 1
expresses, 1
himself,, 1
count!", 1
said, 1
Julie., 1
"Maximilian, 1
goes, 1
with, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
kindest, 1
and, 1
most, 1
persuasive, 1
manner;, 1
"therefore, 1
do, 1
not, 1
make, 1
yourself, 1
uneasy, 1
on, 1
your, 1
brother's, 1
account.", 1
"Once, 1
more, 1
farewell,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
sister;, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
adieu!", 1
Morrel, 1
repeated., 1
"His, 1
carelessness, 1
and, 1
indifference, 1
touch, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
heart,", 1
said, 1
Julie., 1
"Oh,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
certainly, 1
concealing, 1
something, 1
from, 1
us.", 1
"Pshaw!", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
see, 1
him, 1
return, 1
to, 1
you, 1
gay,, 1
smiling,, 1
and, 1
joyful.", 1
Maximilian, 1
cast, 1
a, 1
look, 1
of, 1
disdain,, 1
almost, 1
of, 1
anger,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"We, 1
must, 1
leave, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Before, 1
you, 1

Julie,, 1

"Madame,", 1
interrupted, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
taking, 1
her, 1
two, 1
hands, 1
in, 1
his,, 1
"all, 1
that, 1
you, 1
could, 1
say, 1
in, 1
words, 1
would, 1
never, 1
express, 1
what, 1
I, 1
read, 1
in, 1
your, 1
eyes;, 1
the, 1
thoughts, 1
of, 1
your, 1
heart, 1
are, 1
fully, 1
understood, 1
by, 1
mine., 1
Like, 1
benefactors, 1
in, 1
romances,, 1
I, 1
should, 1
have, 1
left, 1
you, 1
without, 1
seeing, 1
you, 1
again,, 1
but, 1
that, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
virtue, 1
beyond, 1
my, 1
strength,, 1
because, 1
I, 1
am, 1
a, 1
weak, 1
and, 1
vain, 1
man,, 1
fond, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tender,, 1
kind,, 1
and, 1
thankful, 1
glances, 1
of, 1
my, 1
fellow-creatures., 1
On, 1
the, 1
eve, 1
of, 1
departure, 1
I, 1
carry, 1
my, 1
egotism, 1
so, 1
far, 1
as, 1
to, 1
say,, 1
'Do, 1
not, 1
forget, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
kind, 1
friends,, 1
for, 1
probably, 1
you, 1
will, 1
never, 1
see, 1
me, 1
again.'", 1
"Never, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
while, 1
two, 1
large, 1
tears, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
Julie's, 1
cheeks,, 1
"never, 1
behold, 1
you, 1
again?, 1
It, 1
is, 1
not, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
then,, 1
but, 1
some, 1
angel, 1
that, 1
leaves, 1
us,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
angel, 1
is, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
heaven, 1
after, 1
having, 1
appeared, 1
on, 1
earth, 1
to, 1
do, 1
good.", 1
"Say, 1
not, 1
so,", 1
quickly, 1
returned, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo--"say, 1
not, 1
so,, 1
my, 1
friends;, 1
angels, 1
never, 1
err,, 1
celestial, 1
beings, 1

where, 1
they, 1
wish, 1
to, 1

Fate, 1
is, 1
not, 1
more, 1
powerful, 1

it, 1
is, 1

who,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
contrary,, 1
overcome, 1
fate., 1
No,, 1
Emmanuel,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
but, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
admiration, 1
is, 1
as, 1
unmerited, 1
as, 1
your, 1
words, 1
are, 1
sacrilegious.", 1
And, 1
pressing, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
on, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Julie,, 1
who, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
he, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
other, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Emmanuel;, 1
then, 1
tearing, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
this, 1
abode, 1
of, 1
peace, 1
and, 1
happiness,, 1
he, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
to, 1
Maximilian,, 1
who, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
passively,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
indifference, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
perceptible, 1
in, 1
him, 1
ever, 1
since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
Valentine, 1
had, 1
so, 1
stunned, 1
him., 1
"Restore, 1
my, 1
brother, 1
to, 1
peace, 1
and, 1
happiness,", 1
whispered, 1
Julie, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
And, 1
the, 1
count, 1
pressed, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
in, 1
reply,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
eleven, 1
years, 1
before, 1
on, 1
the, 1
staircase, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
Morrel's, 1
study., 1
"You, 1
still, 1
confide,, 1
then,, 1
in, 1
Sinbad, 1
the, 1
Sailor?", 1
asked, 1
he,, 1
smiling., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
ready, 1
answer., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
sleep, 1
in, 1
peace,, 1
and, 1
put, 1
your, 1
trust, 1
in, 1
heaven.", 1
As, 1
we, 1
have, 1
before, 1
said,, 1
the, 1
postchaise, 1
was, 1
waiting;, 1
four, 1
powerful, 1
horses, 1
were, 1
already, 1
pawing, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
with, 1
impatience,, 1
while, 1
Ali,, 1
apparently, 1
just, 1
arrived, 1
from, 1
a, 1
long, 1
walk,, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
the, 1
steps,, 1
his, 1
face, 1
bathed, 1
in, 1
perspiration., 1
"Well,", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
Arabic,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
been, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man?", 1
Ali, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
in, 1
the, 1
affirmative., 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
letter, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
ordered, 1
you, 1
to, 1
do?", 1
The, 1
slave, 1
respectfully, 1
signalized, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had., 1
"And, 1
what, 1
did, 1
he, 1
say,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
do?", 1
Ali, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
light,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
his, 1
master, 1
might, 1
see, 1
him, 1
distinctly,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
imitating, 1
in, 1
his, 1
intelligent, 1
manner, 1
the, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man,, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
as, 1
Noirtier, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
custom, 1
of, 1
doing, 1
when, 1
saying, 1
"Yes.", 1
"Good;, 1
he, 1
accepts,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Now, 1
let, 1
us, 1
go.", 1
These, 1
words, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
escaped, 1
him,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
on, 1
its, 1
way,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
feet, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
struck, 1
a, 1
shower, 1
of, 1
sparks, 1
from, 1
the, 1
pavement., 1
Maximilian, 1
settled, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
his, 1
corner, 1
without, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word., 1
Half, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
when, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
stopped, 1
suddenly;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
just, 1
pulled, 1
the, 1
silken, 1
check-string,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
fastened, 1
to, 1
Ali's, 1
finger., 1
The, 1
Nubian, 1
immediately, 1
descended, 1
and, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
door., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
lovely, 1
starlight, 1
night--they, 1
had, 1
just, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hill, 1
Villejuif,, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
Paris, 1
appears, 1
like, 1
a, 1
sombre, 1
sea, 1
tossing, 1
its, 1
millions, 1
of, 1
phosphoric, 1
waves, 1
into, 1
light--waves, 1
indeed, 1
more, 1
noisy,, 1
more, 1
passionate,, 1
more, 1
changeable,, 1
more, 1
furious,, 1
more, 1
greedy,, 1
than, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tempestuous, 1
ocean,--waves, 1
which, 1
never, 1
rest, 1
as, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
sometimes, 1
do,--waves, 1
ever, 1
dashing,, 1
ever, 1
foaming,, 1
ever, 1
ingulfing, 1
what, 1
falls, 1
within, 1
their, 1
grasp., 1
The, 1
count, 1
stood, 1
alone,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
went, 1
on, 1
for, 1
a, 1
short, 1
distance., 1
With, 1
folded, 1
arms,, 1
he, 1
gazed, 1
for, 1
some, 1
time, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
great, 1
city., 1
When, 1
he, 1
had, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
piercing, 1
look, 1
on, 1
this, 1
modern, 1
Babylon,, 1
which, 1
equally, 1
engages, 1
the, 1
contemplation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
religious, 1
enthusiast,, 1
the, 1
materialist,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
scoffer,--"Great, 1
city,", 1
murmured, 1
he,, 1
inclining, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
joining, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
as, 1
if, 1
in, 1
prayer,, 1
"less, 1
than, 1
six, 1
months, 1
have, 1
elapsed, 1
since, 1
first, 1
I, 1
entered, 1
thy, 1
gates., 1
I, 1
believe, 1
that, 1
the, 1
Spirit, 1
of, 1
God, 1
led, 1
my, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
thee, 1
and, 1
that, 1
he, 1
also, 1
enables, 1
me, 1
to, 1
quit, 1
thee, 1
in, 1
triumph;, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
cause, 1
of, 1
my, 1
presence, 1
within, 1
thy, 1
walls, 1

have, 1
confided, 1
alone, 1
to, 1
him, 1

has, 1

the, 1
power, 1
to, 1

my, 1
heart., 1

only, 1
knows, 1
that, 1

retire, 1
from, 1
thee, 1
without, 1
pride, 1
or, 1
hatred,, 1
but, 1
not, 1
without, 1
many, 1
regrets;, 1
he, 1
only, 1
knows, 1
that, 1
the, 1
power, 1
confided, 1
to, 1
me, 1
has, 1
never, 1
been, 1
made, 1
subservient, 1
to, 1
my, 1
personal, 1
good, 1
or, 1
to, 1
any, 1
useless, 1
cause., 1
Oh,, 1
great, 1
city,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
in, 1
thy, 1
palpitating, 1
bosom, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
found, 1
that, 1
which, 1
I, 1
sought;, 1

a, 1
patient, 1
miner,, 1

dug, 1
deep, 1
into, 1
thy, 1
very, 1

to, 1
root, 1
out, 1

thence., 1
Now, 1
my, 1

is, 1
accomplished,, 1

mission, 1
is, 1
terminated,, 1
now, 1
thou, 1
canst, 1
neither, 1
afford, 1
me, 1
pain, 1
nor, 1
pleasure., 1
Adieu,, 1
Paris,, 1
adieu!", 1
His, 1
look, 1
wandered, 1
over, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
plain, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
some, 1
genius, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night;, 1
he, 1
passed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
over, 1
his, 1
brow,, 1
got, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1

quickly, 1
disappeared, 1
down, 1
the, 1

side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hill, 1
in, 1
a, 1
whirlwind, 1
of, 1
noise, 1
and, 1
dust., 1
Ten, 1
leagues, 1
were, 1
passed, 1
and, 1
not, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word, 1
was, 1
uttered., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
dreaming,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
dreamer., 1
"Morrel,", 1

me, 1
nothing, 1

misfortune.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
the, 1
way, 1
of, 1

stormy, 1
and, 1
unpromising.", 1
"That, 1
may, 1
possibly, 1
be, 1
true,", 1
said, 1
Maximilian,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
again, 1
subsided, 1
into, 1
his, 1
thoughtful, 1
mood., 1
The, 1
journey, 1
was, 1
performed, 1
with, 1
that, 1
marvellous, 1
rapidity, 1
which, 1
the, 1
unlimited, 1
power, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count, 1
ever, 1
commanded., 1
Towns, 1
fled, 1
from, 1
them, 1
like, 1
shadows, 1
on, 1
their, 1
path,, 1
and, 1
trees, 1
shaken, 1
by, 1
the, 1
first, 1
winds, 1
of, 1
autumn, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
giants, 1
madly, 1
rushing, 1
on, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
retreating, 1
as, 1
rapidly, 1
when, 1
once, 1
reached., 1
The, 1
following, 1
morning, 1
they, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
Chalons,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
steamboat, 1
waited, 1
for, 1
them., 1
Without, 1
the, 1
loss, 1
of, 1
an, 1
instant,, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
board, 1
and, 1
the, 1
two, 1
travellers, 1
embarked, 1
without, 1
delay., 1
The, 1
boat, 1
was, 1
built, 1
for, 1
speed;, 1
her, 1
two, 1
paddle-wheels, 1
were, 1
like, 1
two, 1
wings, 1
with, 1
which, 1
she, 1
skimmed, 1
the, 1
water, 1
like, 1
a, 1
bird., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
not, 1
insensible, 1
to, 1
that, 1
sensation, 1
of, 1
delight, 1
which, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
experienced, 1
in, 1
passing, 1
rapidly, 1
through, 1
the, 1
air,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
wind, 1
which, 1
occasionally, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
hair, 1
from, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
seemed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
point, 1
of, 1
dispelling, 1
momentarily, 1
the, 1
clouds, 1
collected, 1
there., 1
As, 1
the, 1
distance, 1
increased, 1
between, 1
the, 1
travellers, 1
and, 1
Paris,, 1
almost, 1
superhuman, 1
serenity, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
surround, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
he, 1
might, 1
have, 1
been, 1
taken, 1
for, 1
an, 1
exile, 1
about, 1
to, 1

Powerful, 1
memories, 1
were, 1
stirred, 1
within, 1
them, 1
by, 1
the, 1
sight, 1
of, 1

at, 1

1622., 1
"Here,", 1

leaning, 1
heavily, 1
on, 1

arm, 1
of, 1

witnessed, 1
our, 1
meeting, 1
wept, 1
also.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
gently, 1
smiled, 1
and, 1
said,--"I, 1
was, 1
there;", 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
pointing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
street., 1
As, 1
he, 1
spoke,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
the, 1
very, 1
direction, 1
he, 1
indicated,, 1
a, 1
groan,, 1
expressive, 1
of, 1
bitter, 1
grief,, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
waving, 1
her, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
a, 1
passenger, 1
on, 1
board, 1
the, 1
vessel, 1
about, 1
to, 1
sail., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
her, 1
with, 1
an, 1
emotion, 1
that, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
remarked, 1
by, 1
Morrel, 1

not, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
been, 1
fixed, 1
on, 1
the, 1
vessel., 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
deceive, 1
myself--that, 1
young, 1
man, 1
who, 1
is, 1

hat,, 1

youth, 1
in, 1

"Yes,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"I, 1
recognized, 1
him.", 1
"How, 1
so?--you, 1
were, 1
looking, 1
the, 1
other, 1
way.", 1
the, 1
Count, 1
smiled,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
habit, 1
of, 1
doing, 1
when, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
want, 1
to, 1
make, 1
any, 1
reply,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
again, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
veiled, 1
woman,, 1
who, 1
soon, 1
disappeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street., 1
Turning, 1
to, 1
his, 1
friend,--"Dear, 1
Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"have, 1
you, 1
nothing, 1
to, 1
do, 1
in, 1
this, 1
land?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
to, 1
weep, 1
over, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
broken, 1
voice., 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
go,--wait, 1
for, 1
me, 1
there,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
join, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1
then?", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
also, 1
have, 1
a, 1
pious, 1
visit, 1
to, 1
pay.", 1
Morrel, 1
allowed, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
fall, 1
into, 1
that, 1
which, 1
the, 1
count, 1
extended, 1
to, 1
him;, 1
then, 1
with, 1
an, 1
inexpressibly, 1
sorrowful, 1
inclination, 1
of, 1
the, 1
head, 1
he, 1
quitted, 1
the, 1
count, 1
and, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
steps, 1
to, 1
the, 1
east, 1
of, 1
the, 1
city., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
remained, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
spot, 1
until, 1
Maximilian, 1
was, 1
out, 1
of, 1
sight;, 1
he, 1
then, 1
walked, 1
slowly, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
Allees, 1
de, 1
Meillan, 1
to, 1
seek, 1
out, 1
a, 1
small, 1
house, 1
with, 1
which, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
were, 1
made, 1
familiar, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
this, 1
story., 1
It, 1
yet, 1
stood,, 1
under, 1
the, 1
shade, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
avenue, 1
of, 1
lime-trees,, 1
which, 1
forms, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
frequent, 1
walks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
idlers, 1
of, 1
Marseilles,, 1
covered, 1
by, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
vine,, 1
which, 1
spreads, 1
its, 1
aged, 1
and, 1
blackened, 1
branches, 1
over, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
front,, 1
burnt, 1
yellow, 1
by, 1
the, 1
ardent, 1
sun, 1
of, 1
the, 1
south., 1
Two, 1
stone, 1
steps, 1
worn, 1
away, 1
by, 1
the, 1
friction, 1
of, 1
many, 1
feet, 1
led, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
made, 1
of, 1
three, 1
planks;, 1
the, 1
door, 1
had, 1
never, 1
been, 1
painted, 1
or, 1
varnished,, 1
so, 1
great, 1
cracks, 1
yawned, 1
in, 1
it, 1
during, 1
the, 1
dry, 1
season, 1
to, 1
close, 1
again, 1
when, 1
the, 1
rains, 1
came, 1
on., 1
The, 1
house,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
its, 1
crumbling, 1
antiquity, 1
and, 1
apparent, 1
misery,, 1
was, 1
yet, 1
cheerful, 1
and, 1
picturesque,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
that, 1
old, 1
Dantes, 1
formerly, 1
inhabited--the, 1
only, 1
difference, 1
being, 1
that, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
occupied, 1
merely, 1
the, 1
garret,, 1
while, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
house, 1
was, 1
now, 1
placed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
command, 1
of, 1
Mercedes, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count., 1
The, 1
woman, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
leave, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
with, 1
so, 1
much, 1
regret, 1
entered, 1
this, 1
house;, 1
she, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
after, 1
her, 1
when, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
appeared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
a, 1
street,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
he, 1
found, 1
and, 1
lost, 1
her, 1
again, 1
almost, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
instant., 1
The, 1
worn, 1
out, 1
steps, 1
were, 1
old, 1
acquaintances, 1
of, 1
his;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
better, 1
than, 1
any, 1
one, 1
else, 1
how, 1
to, 1
open, 1
that, 1
weather-beaten, 1
door, 1
with, 1
the, 1
large, 1
headed, 1
nail, 1
which, 1
served, 1
to, 1
raise, 1
the, 1
latch, 1
within., 1
He, 1
entered, 1
without, 1
knocking,, 1
or, 1
giving, 1
any, 1
other, 1
intimation, 1
of, 1
his, 1
presence,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
or, 1
the, 1
master, 1
of, 1
the, 1
place., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
a, 1
passage, 1
paved, 1
with, 1
bricks,, 1
was, 1
a, 1
little, 1
garden,, 1
bathed, 1
in, 1
sunshine,, 1
and, 1
rich, 1
in, 1
warmth, 1
and, 1
light., 1
In, 1
this, 1
garden, 1
Mercedes, 1
had, 1
found,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
place, 1
indicated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
the, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
money, 1
which, 1
he,, 1
through, 1
a, 1
sense, 1
of, 1
delicacy,, 1
had, 1
described, 1
as, 1
having, 1
been, 1
placed, 1
there, 1
twenty-four, 1
years, 1
previously., 1
The, 1
trees, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garden, 1
were, 1
easily, 1
seen, 1
from, 1
the, 1
steps, 1
of, 1
the, 1
street-door., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
on, 1
stepping, 1
into, 1
the, 1
house,, 1
heard, 1
a, 1
sigh, 1
that, 1
was, 1
almost, 1
a, 1
deep, 1
sob;, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
in, 1
the, 1
direction, 1
whence, 1
it, 1
came,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
under, 1
an, 1

with, 1
its, 1
thick, 1
foliage, 1

seated,, 1
with, 1

bowed,, 1
and, 1
weeping, 1
bitterly., 1
She, 1

raised, 1
her, 1
veil,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
her, 1
face, 1
hidden, 1
by, 1
her, 1
hands, 1
was, 1
giving, 1
free, 1
scope, 1
to, 1
the, 1
sighs, 1
and, 1
tears, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
long, 1
restrained, 1
by, 1
the, 1
presence, 1
of, 1

were, 1
heard, 1
on, 1
the, 1
gravel., 1
Mercedes, 1
raised, 1
her, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry, 1
of, 1

he, 1
asked., 1
"On, 1

shall, 1

to, 1
heaven, 1
with, 1
solemnity., 1
"I, 1

you, 1

And, 1
after, 1
pressing, 1
her, 1
own, 1
trembling, 1
hand, 1
upon, 1

up, 1

Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
slowly, 1
left, 1
the, 1
house, 1

turned, 1
towards, 1

Mercedes, 1
did, 1
not, 1
witness, 1
his, 1
departure,, 1

she, 1
was, 1
seated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
little, 1
window, 1
of, 1
the, 1
room, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
old, 1
Dantes., 1
Her, 1
eyes, 1
were, 1
straining, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
ship, 1
which, 1
was, 1
carrying, 1
her, 1
son, 1
over, 1
the, 1
vast, 1
sea;, 1
but, 1
still, 1
her, 1
voice, 1
involuntarily, 1
murmured, 1
softly,, 1
"Edmond,, 1
Edmond,, 1
Edmond!", 1
Chapter, 1
113., 1
The, 1
Past., 1
The, 1
count, 1
departed, 1
with, 1
a, 1
sad, 1
heart, 1
from, 1
the, 1
house, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left, 1
Mercedes,, 1
probably, 1
never, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
her, 1
again., 1
Since, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
little, 1
Edward, 1
a, 1
great, 1
change, 1
had, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
in, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Having, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
his, 1
vengeance, 1
by, 1
a, 1
long, 1
and, 1
tortuous, 1
path,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
an, 1
abyss, 1
of, 1
doubt, 1
yawning, 1
before, 1
him., 1
More, 1
than, 1
this,, 1
the, 1
conversation, 1
which, 1
had, 1
just, 1
taken, 1
place, 1
between, 1
Mercedes, 1
and, 1
himself, 1
had, 1
awakened, 1
so, 1
many, 1
recollections, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
that, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
it, 1
necessary, 1
to, 1
combat, 1
with, 1
them., 1
A, 1
man, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
temperament, 1
could, 1
not, 1
long, 1
indulge, 1
in, 1
that, 1
melancholy, 1
which, 1
can, 1
exist, 1
in, 1
common, 1
minds,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
destroys, 1
superior, 1
ones., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
he, 1
must, 1
have, 1
made, 1
an, 1
error, 1
in, 1
his, 1
calculations, 1
if, 1
he, 1
now, 1
found, 1
cause, 1
to, 1
blame, 1
himself., 1
"I, 1
cannot, 1
have, 1
deceived, 1
myself,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
past, 1
in, 1
a, 1
false, 1
light., 1
What!", 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
"can, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
following, 1
a, 1
false, 1
path?--can, 1
the, 1
end, 1
which, 1
I, 1
proposed, 1
be, 1
a, 1
mistaken, 1
end?--can, 1
one, 1
hour, 1
have, 1
sufficed, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
an, 1
architect, 1
that, 1
the, 1
work, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
he, 1
founded, 1
all, 1
his, 1
hopes, 1
was, 1
an, 1
impossible,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
a, 1
sacrilegious,, 1
undertaking?, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
reconcile, 1
myself, 1
to, 1
this, 1
idea--it, 1
would, 1
madden, 1
me., 1
The, 1
reason, 1
why, 1
I, 1
am, 1
now, 1
dissatisfied, 1
is, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
not, 1
a, 1
clear, 1
appreciation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
past., 1
The, 1
past,, 1
like, 1
the, 1
country, 1
through, 1
which, 1
we, 1
walk,, 1
becomes, 1
indistinct, 1
as, 1
we, 1
advance., 1
My, 1
position, 1
is, 1
like, 1
that, 1
of, 1
a, 1
person, 1
wounded, 1
in, 1
a, 1
dream;, 1
he, 1
feels, 1
the, 1
wound,, 1
though, 1
he, 1
cannot, 1
recollect, 1
when, 1
he, 1
received, 1
it., 1
Come,, 1
then,, 1
thou, 1
regenerate, 1
man,, 1
thou, 1
extravagant, 1
prodigal,, 1
thou, 1
awakened, 1
sleeper,, 1
thou, 1
all-powerful, 1
visionary,, 1
thou, 1
invincible, 1
millionaire,--once, 1
again, 1
review, 1
thy, 1
past, 1
life, 1
of, 1
starvation, 1
and, 1
wretchedness,, 1
revisit, 1
the, 1
scenes, 1
where, 1
fate, 1
and, 1
misfortune, 1
conducted,, 1
and, 1
where, 1
despair, 1
received, 1
thee., 1
Too, 1
many, 1
diamonds,, 1
too, 1
much, 1
gold, 1
and, 1
splendor,, 1
are, 1
now, 1
reflected, 1
by, 1
the, 1
mirror, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
seeks, 1
to, 1
behold, 1
Dantes., 1
Hide, 1
thy, 1
diamonds,, 1
bury, 1
thy, 1
gold,, 1
shroud, 1
thy, 1
splendor,, 1
exchange, 1
riches, 1
for, 1
poverty,, 1
liberty, 1
for, 1
a, 1
prison,, 1
a, 1
living, 1
body, 1
for, 1
a, 1
corpse!", 1
As, 1
he, 1
thus, 1
reasoned,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
walked, 1
down, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
de, 1
la, 1
Caisserie., 1
It, 1
was, 1
the, 1
same, 1
through, 1
which,, 1
twenty-four, 1
years, 1
ago,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
conducted, 1
by, 1
a, 1
silent, 1
and, 1
nocturnal, 1
guard;, 1
the, 1
houses,, 1
to-day, 1
so, 1
smiling, 1
and, 1
animated,, 1
were, 1
on, 1
that, 1
night, 1
dark,, 1
mute,, 1
and, 1
closed., 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
they, 1
were, 1
the, 1
same,", 1
murmured, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"only, 1
now, 1
it, 1
is, 1
broad, 1
daylight, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
night;, 1
it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
which, 1
brightens, 1
the, 1
place,, 1
and, 1
makes, 1
it, 1
appear, 1
so, 1
cheerful.", 1
He, 1
proceeded, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
quay, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Rue, 1
Saint-Laurent,, 1
and, 1
advanced, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Consigne;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
the, 1
point, 1
where, 1
he, 1
had, 1
embarked., 1
A, 1
pleasure-boat, 1
with, 1
striped, 1
awning, 1
was, 1
going, 1
by., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
called, 1
the, 1
owner,, 1
who, 1
immediately, 1
rowed, 1
up, 1
to, 1
him, 1
with, 1
the, 1
eagerness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
boatman, 1
hoping, 1
for, 1
a, 1
good, 1
fare., 1
The, 1
weather, 1
was, 1
magnificent,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
excursion, 1
a, 1
treat., 1
The, 1
sun,, 1
red, 1
and, 1
flaming,, 1
was, 1
sinking, 1
into, 1
the, 1
embrace, 1
of, 1
the, 1
welcoming, 1
ocean., 1
The, 1
sea,, 1
smooth, 1
as, 1
crystal,, 1
was, 1
now, 1
and, 1
then, 1
disturbed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
leaping, 1
of, 1
fish,, 1
which, 1
were, 1
pursued, 1
by, 1
some, 1
unseen, 1
enemy, 1
and, 1
sought, 1
for, 1
safety, 1
in, 1
another, 1
element;, 1
while, 1
on, 1
the, 1
extreme, 1
verge, 1
of, 1
the, 1
horizon, 1
might, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
the, 1
fishermen's, 1
boats,, 1
white, 1
and, 1
graceful, 1
as, 1
the, 1
sea-gull,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
merchant, 1
vessels, 1
bound, 1
for, 1
Corsica, 1
or, 1
Spain., 1
But, 1
notwithstanding, 1
the, 1
serene, 1
sky,, 1
the, 1
gracefully, 1
formed, 1
boats,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
golden, 1
light, 1
in, 1
which, 1
the, 1
whole, 1
scene, 1
was, 1
bathed,, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
wrapped, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cloak,, 1
could, 1
think, 1
only, 1
of, 1
this, 1
terrible, 1
voyage,, 1
the, 1
details, 1
of, 1
which, 1
were, 1
one, 1
by, 1
one, 1
recalled, 1
to, 1
his, 1
memory., 1
The, 1
solitary, 1
light, 1
burning, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Catalans;, 1
that, 1
first, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If,, 1
which, 1
told, 1
him, 1
whither, 1
they, 1
were, 1
leading, 1
him;, 1
the, 1
struggle, 1
with, 1
the, 1
gendarmes, 1
when, 1
he, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
throw, 1
himself, 1
overboard;, 1
his, 1
despair, 1
when, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
vanquished,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sensation, 1
when, 1
the, 1
muzzle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carbine, 1
touched, 1
his, 1
forehead--all, 1
these, 1
were, 1
brought, 1
before, 1
him, 1
in, 1
vivid, 1
and, 1
frightful, 1
reality., 1
Like, 1
the, 1
streams, 1
which, 1
the, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
summer, 1
has, 1
dried, 1
up,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
after, 1
the, 1
autumnal, 1
storms, 1
gradually, 1
begin, 1
oozing, 1
drop, 1
by, 1
drop,, 1
so, 1
did, 1
the, 1
count, 1
feel, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
gradually, 1
fill, 1
with, 1
the, 1
bitterness, 1
which, 1
formerly, 1
nearly, 1
overwhelmed, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes., 1
Clear, 1
sky,, 1
swift-flitting, 1
boats,, 1
and, 1
brilliant, 1
sunshine, 1
disappeared;, 1
the, 1
heavens, 1
were, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
black,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
gigantic, 1
structure, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
phantom, 1
of, 1
a, 1
mortal, 1
enemy., 1
As, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
shore,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
instinctively, 1
shrunk, 1
to, 1
the, 1
extreme, 1
end, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
owner, 1
was, 1
obliged, 1
to, 1
call, 1
out,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
sweetest, 1
tone, 1
of, 1
voice,, 1
"Sir,, 1
we, 1
are, 1
at, 1
the, 1
landing.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
on, 1
that, 1
very, 1
spot,, 1
on, 1
the, 1
same, 1
rock,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
violently, 1
dragged, 1
by, 1
the, 1
guards,, 1
who, 1
forced, 1
him, 1
to, 1
ascend, 1
the, 1
slope, 1
at, 1
the, 1
points, 1
of, 1
their, 1
bayonets., 1
The, 1
journey, 1
had, 1
seemed, 1
very, 1
long, 1
to, 1
Dantes,, 1
but, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
found, 1
it, 1
equally, 1
short., 1
Each, 1
stroke, 1
of, 1
the, 1
oar, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
awaken, 1
a, 1
new, 1
throng, 1
of, 1
ideas,, 1
which, 1
sprang, 1
up, 1
with, 1
the, 1
flying, 1
spray, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
There, 1
had, 1
been, 1
no, 1
prisoners, 1
confined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If, 1
since, 1
the, 1
revolution, 1
of, 1
July;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
only, 1
inhabited, 1
by, 1
a, 1
guard,, 1
kept, 1
there, 1
for, 1
the, 1
prevention, 1
of, 1
smuggling., 1
A, 1
concierge, 1
waited, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door, 1
to, 1
exhibit, 1
to, 1
visitors, 1
this, 1
monument, 1
of, 1
curiosity,, 1
once, 1
a, 1
scene, 1
of, 1
terror., 1
The, 1
count, 1
inquired, 1
whether, 1
any, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ancient, 1
jailers, 1
were, 1
still, 1
there;, 1
but, 1
they, 1
had, 1
all, 1
been, 1
pensioned,, 1
or, 1
had, 1
passed, 1
on, 1
to, 1
some, 1
other, 1
employment., 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
who, 1
attended, 1
him, 1
had, 1
only, 1
been, 1
there, 1
since, 1
1830., 1
He, 1
visited, 1
his, 1
own, 1
dungeon., 1
He, 1
again, 1
beheld, 1
the, 1
dull, 1
light, 1
vainly, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
the, 1
narrow, 1
opening., 1
His, 1
eyes, 1
rested, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
where, 1
had, 1
stood, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
since, 1
then, 1
removed,, 1
and, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
the, 1
new, 1
stones, 1
indicated, 1
where, 1
the, 1
breach, 1
made, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
been., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
limbs, 1
tremble;, 1
he, 1
seated, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
log, 1
of, 1
wood., 1
"Are, 1
there, 1
any, 1
stories, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
this, 1
prison, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
one, 1
relating, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poisoning, 1
of, 1
Mirabeau?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"are, 1
there, 1

difficult, 1

imprisoned, 1
their, 1
fellow-creatures?", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir;, 1
indeed,, 1
the, 1
jailer, 1
Antoine, 1
told, 1
me, 1
one, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
this, 1
very, 1
dungeon.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
shuddered;, 1
Antoine, 1
had, 1
been, 1
his, 1
jailer., 1
He, 1
had, 1
almost, 1
forgotten, 1
his, 1
name, 1
and, 1
face,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mention, 1
of, 1
the, 1
name, 1
he, 1
recalled, 1
his, 1
person, 1
as, 1
he, 1
used, 1
to, 1
see, 1
it,, 1
the, 1
face, 1
encircled, 1
by, 1
a, 1
beard,, 1
wearing, 1
the, 1
brown, 1
jacket,, 1
the, 1
bunch, 1
of, 1
keys,, 1
the, 1
jingling, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
still, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
hear., 1
The, 1
count, 1
turned, 1
around,, 1
and, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
rendered, 1
still, 1
darker, 1
by, 1
the, 1
torch, 1
carried, 1
by, 1
the, 1
concierge., 1
"Would, 1
you, 1
like, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
the, 1
story,, 1
sir?", 1
"Yes;, 1
relate, 1
it,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
pressing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
to, 1
still, 1
its, 1
violent, 1
beatings;, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
afraid, 1
of, 1
hearing, 1
his, 1
own, 1
history., 1
"This, 1
dungeon,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
concierge,, 1
"was,, 1
it, 1
appears,, 1
some, 1
time, 1
ago, 1
occupied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
very, 1
dangerous, 1
prisoner,, 1
the, 1
more, 1
so, 1
since, 1
he, 1
was, 1
full, 1
of, 1
industry., 1

was, 1
confined, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
at, 1
the, 1

he, 1
was, 1
not, 1

was, 1
only, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
mad, 1
priest.", 1
"Ah,, 1
indeed?--mad!", 1
repeated, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo;, 1
"and, 1
what, 1
was, 1
his, 1
mania?", 1
"He, 1
offered, 1
millions, 1
to, 1
any, 1
one, 1
who, 1
would, 1

raised, 1

was, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
veil, 1
between, 1
him, 1

He, 1

a, 1
veil, 1
before, 1

offered, 1
the, 1
treasures., 1
"Could, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
see, 1
each, 1
other?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
sir,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
expressly, 1
forbidden;, 1

they, 1
eluded, 1
the, 1
vigilance, 1
of, 1
the, 1

"And, 1
which, 1

this, 1
passage?", 1

have, 1
been, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1

was, 1
strong, 1

him, 1
to, 1

"Blind, 1
fools!", 1

the, 1
count., 1
"However,, 1

evidence, 1

in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
hoarse, 1

this, 1
was, 1

they, 1
merely, 1
attached, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1

guide, 1
carried, 1
away, 1
the, 1
torch., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
spoken, 1
correctly., 1
Scarcely, 1
had, 1
a, 1
few, 1
seconds, 1
elapsed,, 1
ere, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
everything, 1
as, 1
distinctly, 1
as, 1
by, 1
daylight., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
really, 1
recognized, 1
his, 1
dungeon., 1
"Yes,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"there, 1
is, 1
the, 1
stone, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
I, 1
used, 1
to, 1
sit;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
the, 1
impression, 1
made, 1
by, 1
my, 1
shoulders, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
the, 1
mark, 1
of, 1
my, 1
blood, 1
made, 1
when, 1
one, 1
day, 1
I, 1
dashed, 1
my, 1
head, 1
against, 1
the, 1
wall., 1
Oh,, 1
those, 1
figures,, 1
how, 1
well, 1
I, 1
remember, 1
them!, 1
I, 1
made, 1
them, 1
one, 1
day, 1
to, 1
calculate, 1
the, 1
age, 1
of, 1
my, 1
father,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
might, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
I, 1
should, 1
find, 1
him, 1
still, 1
living,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Mercedes,, 1
to, 1
know, 1
if, 1
I, 1
should, 1
find, 1
her, 1
still, 1
free., 1
After, 1
finishing, 1
that, 1
calculation,, 1
I, 1
had, 1
a, 1
minute's, 1
hope., 1
I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
reckon, 1
upon, 1
hunger, 1
and, 1
infidelity!", 1
and, 1
a, 1
bitter, 1
laugh, 1
escaped, 1
the, 1
count., 1
He, 1
saw, 1
in, 1
fancy, 1
the, 1
burial, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
of, 1
Mercedes., 1
On, 1
the, 1
other, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dungeon, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
an, 1
inscription,, 1
the, 1
white, 1
letters, 1
of, 1
which, 1
were, 1
still, 1
visible, 1
on, 1
the, 1
green, 1
wall., 1
"'O, 1
God,'", 1
he, 1
read,, 1
"'preserve, 1
my, 1
memory!', 1
Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"that, 1
was, 1
my, 1
only, 1
prayer, 1
at, 1
last;, 1
I, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
begged, 1
for, 1
liberty,, 1
but, 1
memory;, 1
I, 1
dreaded, 1
to, 1
become, 1
mad, 1
and, 1
forgetful., 1
O, 1
God,, 1
thou, 1
hast, 1
preserved, 1
my, 1
memory;, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
thee,, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
thee!", 1
At, 1
this, 1
moment, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
torch, 1
was, 1
reflected, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall;, 1
the, 1
guide, 1
was, 1
coming;, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
went, 1
to, 1
meet, 1
him., 1
"Follow, 1
me,, 1
sir;", 1
and, 1
without, 1
ascending, 1
the, 1
stairs, 1
the, 1
guide, 1
conducted, 1
him, 1
by, 1
a, 1
subterraneous, 1
passage, 1
to, 1
another, 1
entrance., 1
There,, 1
again,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
was, 1
assailed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
multitude, 1
of, 1
thoughts., 1
The, 1
first, 1
thing, 1
that, 1
met, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
the, 1
meridian,, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
the, 1
abbe, 1
on, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
by, 1
which, 1
he, 1
calculated, 1
the, 1
time;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed, 1
on, 1
which, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
prisoner, 1
had, 1
died., 1
The, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
this,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
exciting, 1
the, 1
anguish, 1
experienced, 1
by, 1
the, 1
count, 1
in, 1
the, 1
dungeon,, 1
filled, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
with, 1
a, 1
soft, 1
and, 1
grateful, 1
sentiment,, 1
and, 1
tears, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
"This, 1
is, 1
where, 1
the, 1
mad, 1
abbe, 1
was, 1
kept,, 1
sir,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
is, 1
where, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
entered;", 1
and, 1
the, 1
guide, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
remained, 1
unclosed., 1
"From, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
stone,", 1
he, 1
continued,, 1
"a, 1
learned, 1
gentleman, 1
discovered, 1
that, 1
the, 1
prisoners, 1
might, 1
have, 1
communicated, 1
together, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
years., 1
Poor, 1
things!, 1
Those, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
ten, 1
weary, 1
years.", 1
Dantes, 1
took, 1
some, 1
louis, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
gave, 1
them, 1
to, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
twice, 1
unconsciously, 1
pitied, 1
him., 1
The, 1
guide, 1
took, 1
them,, 1
thinking, 1
them, 1
merely, 1
a, 1
few, 1
pieces, 1
of, 1
little, 1
value;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
torch, 1
revealed, 1
their, 1
true, 1
worth., 1
"Sir,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"you, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
mistake;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
given, 1
me, 1
gold.", 1
"I, 1
know, 1
it.", 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
surprise., 1
"Sir,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
scarcely, 1
able, 1
to, 1
believe, 1
his, 1
good, 1
fortune--"sir,, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
understand, 1
your, 1
generosity!", 1
"Oh,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
very, 1
simple,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow;, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
a, 1
sailor,, 1
and, 1
your, 1
story, 1
touched, 1
me, 1
more, 1
than, 1
it, 1
would, 1
others.", 1
"Then,, 1
sir,, 1
since, 1
you, 1
are, 1
so, 1
liberal,, 1
I, 1
ought, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
you, 1
something.", 1
"What, 1
have, 1
you, 1
to, 1
offer, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
friend?, 1
Shells?, 1
Straw-work?, 1
Thank, 1
you!", 1
"No,, 1
sir,, 1
neither, 1
of, 1
those;, 1
something, 1
connected, 1
with, 1
this, 1
story.", 1
"Really?, 1
What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
guide;, 1
"I, 1
said, 1
to, 1
myself,, 1
'Something, 1
is, 1
always, 1
left, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cell, 1
inhabited, 1
by, 1
one, 1
prisoner, 1
for, 1
fifteen, 1
years,', 1
so, 1
I, 1
began, 1
to, 1
sound, 1
the, 1
wall.", 1
"Ah,", 1
cried, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
remembering, 1
the, 1
abbe's, 1
two, 1
hiding-places., 1
"After, 1
some, 1
search,, 1
I, 1
found, 1
that, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
gave, 1
a, 1
hollow, 1
sound, 1
near, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
hearth.", 1
"Yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"yes.", 1
"I, 1
raised, 1
the, 1
stones,, 1
and, 1
found"--, 1
"A, 1
rope-ladder, 1
and, 1
some, 1
tools?", 1
"How, 1
do, 1
you, 1
know, 1
that?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
guide, 1
in, 1
astonishment., 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know--I, 1
only, 1
guess, 1
it,, 1
because, 1
that, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
generally, 1
found, 1
in, 1
prisoners', 1
cells.", 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
a, 1
rope-ladder, 1
and, 1
tools.", 1
"And, 1
have, 1
you, 1
them, 1
yet?", 1
"No,, 1
sir;, 1
I, 1
sold, 1
them, 1
to, 1
visitors,, 1
who, 1
considered, 1
them, 1
great, 1
curiosities;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
have, 1
still, 1
something, 1
left.", 1
"What, 1
is, 1
it?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
impatiently., 1
"A, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
book,, 1
written, 1
upon, 1
strips, 1
of, 1
cloth.", 1
"Go, 1
and, 1
fetch, 1
it,, 1
my, 1
good, 1
fellow;, 1
and, 1
if, 1
it, 1
be, 1
what, 1
I, 1
hope,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
do, 1
well.", 1
"I, 1
will, 1
run, 1
for, 1
it,, 1
sir;", 1
and, 1
the, 1
guide, 1
went, 1
out., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
count, 1
knelt, 1
down, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bed,, 1
which, 1
death, 1
had, 1
converted, 1
into, 1
an, 1
altar., 1
"Oh,, 1
second, 1
father,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"thou, 1
who, 1
hast, 1
given, 1
me, 1
liberty,, 1
knowledge,, 1
riches;, 1
thou, 1
who,, 1
like, 1
beings, 1
of, 1
a, 1
superior, 1
order, 1
to, 1
ourselves,, 1
couldst, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
science, 1
of, 1
good, 1
and, 1
evil;, 1
if, 1
in, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
the, 1
tomb, 1
there, 1
still, 1
remain, 1
something, 1
within, 1
us, 1

can, 1

to, 1
the, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
those, 1
who, 1
are, 1
left, 1
on, 1

we, 1
have, 1
lived, 1

suffered,--then,, 1
noble, 1
heart,, 1
sublime, 1
soul,, 1

conjure, 1
thee, 1
by, 1
the, 1
paternal, 1
love, 1
thou, 1
didst, 1
bear, 1
me,, 1

the, 1
filial, 1
obedience, 1

vowed, 1
to, 1
thee,, 1

me, 1
some, 1
sign,, 1
some, 1
revelation!, 1

from, 1
me, 1
the, 1
remains, 1
of, 1
doubt,, 1
which,, 1
if, 1
it, 1
change, 1
not, 1
to, 1
conviction,, 1
must, 1
become, 1
remorse!", 1
The, 1
count, 1
bowed, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
clasped, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
together., 1
"Here,, 1
sir,", 1
said, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
behind, 1
him., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
shuddered,, 1
and, 1
arose., 1
The, 1
concierge, 1
held, 1
out, 1
the, 1
strips, 1
of, 1
cloth, 1
upon, 1
which, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria, 1
had, 1
spread, 1
the, 1
riches, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mind., 1
The, 1
manuscript, 1
was, 1
the, 1
great, 1
work, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Abbe, 1
Faria, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
kingdoms, 1
of, 1
Italy., 1
The, 1
count, 1
seized, 1
it, 1
hastily,, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
immediately, 1
fell, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
epigraph,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
read,, 1
"'Thou, 1
shalt, 1
tear, 1
out, 1
the, 1
dragons', 1
teeth,, 1
and, 1
shall, 1
trample, 1
the, 1
lions, 1
under, 1
foot,, 1
saith, 1
the, 1
Lord.'", 1
"Ah,", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
answer., 1
Thanks,, 1
father,, 1
thanks.", 1
And, 1
feeling, 1
in, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
he, 1
took, 1
thence, 1
a, 1
small, 1
pocket-book,, 1
which, 1
contained, 1
ten, 1
bank-notes,, 1
each, 1
of, 1
1,000., 1
francs., 1
"Here,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"take, 1
this, 1
pocket-book.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
only, 1
on, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
open, 1
it, 1
till, 1
I, 1
am, 1
gone;", 1
and, 1
placing, 1
in, 1
his, 1
breast, 1
the, 1
treasure, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
found,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
more, 1
valuable, 1
to, 1
him, 1
than, 1
the, 1
richest, 1
jewel,, 1
he, 1
rushed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
corridor,, 1
and, 1
reaching, 1
his, 1
boat,, 1
cried,, 1
"To, 1
Marseilles!", 1
Then,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
departed,, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
gloomy, 1
prison., 1
"Woe,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
confined, 1
me, 1
in, 1
that, 1
wretched, 1
prison;, 1
and, 1
woe, 1
to, 1
those, 1
who, 1
forgot, 1
that, 1
I, 1
was, 1
there!", 1
As, 1
he, 1
repassed, 1
the, 1
Catalans,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
turned, 1
around, 1
and, 1
burying, 1
his, 1
head, 1
in, 1
his, 1
cloak, 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
name, 1
of, 1
a, 1
woman., 1
The, 1
victory, 1
was, 1
complete;, 1
twice, 1
he, 1
had, 1
overcome, 1
his, 1
doubts., 1
The, 1
name, 1
he, 1
pronounced,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
of, 1
tenderness,, 1
amounting, 1
almost, 1
to, 1
love,, 1
was, 1
that, 1
of, 1
Haidee., 1
On, 1
landing,, 1
the, 1
count, 1
turned, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
cemetery,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
finding, 1
Morrel., 1
He,, 1
too,, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
ago,, 1
had, 1
piously, 1
sought, 1
out, 1
a, 1
tomb,, 1
and, 1
sought, 1
it, 1
vainly., 1
He,, 1
who, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
France, 1
with, 1
millions,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
unable, 1
to, 1
find, 1
the, 1
grave, 1
of, 1
his, 1
father,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
perished, 1
from, 1
hunger., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
indeed, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
cross, 1
over, 1
the, 1
spot,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
had, 1
fallen, 1
down, 1
and, 1
the, 1
grave-digger, 1
had, 1
burnt, 1
it,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
did, 1
all, 1
the, 1
old, 1
wood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
churchyard., 1
The, 1
worthy, 1
merchant, 1
had, 1
been, 1
more, 1
fortunate., 1
Dying, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
his, 1
children,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
by, 1
them, 1
laid, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
his, 1
wife,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
preceded, 1
him, 1
in, 1
eternity, 1
by, 1
two, 1
years., 1
Two, 1
large, 1
slabs, 1
of, 1
marble,, 1
on, 1
which, 1
were, 1
inscribed, 1
their, 1
names,, 1
were, 1
placed, 1
on, 1
either, 1
side, 1
of, 1
a, 1
little, 1
enclosure,, 1
railed, 1
in,, 1
and, 1
shaded, 1
by, 1
four, 1
cypress-trees., 1
Morrel, 1
was, 1
leaning, 1
against, 1
one, 1
of, 1
these,, 1
mechanically, 1
fixing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
the, 1
graves., 1
His, 1
grief, 1
was, 1
so, 1
profound, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
nearly, 1
unconscious., 1
"Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
should, 1
not, 1
look, 1
on, 1
the, 1
graves,, 1
but, 1
there;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
pointed, 1
upwards., 1
"The, 1
dead, 1
are, 1
everywhere,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"did, 1
you, 1
not, 1
yourself, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
so, 1
as, 1
we, 1
left, 1
Paris?", 1
"Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
asked, 1
me, 1
during, 1
the, 1
journey, 1
to, 1
allow, 1
you, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
some, 1
days, 1
at, 1
Marseilles., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
wishes,, 1
count;, 1
only, 1
I, 1
fancy, 1
I, 1
could, 1
pass, 1
the, 1
time, 1
less, 1
painfully, 1
here, 1
than, 1
anywhere, 1
else.", 1
"So, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better,, 1
for, 1
I, 1
must, 1
leave, 1
you;, 1
but, 1
I, 1
carry, 1
your, 1
word, 1
with, 1
me,, 1
do, 1
I, 1
not?", 1
"Ah,, 1
count,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
forget, 1
it.", 1
"No,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
forget, 1
it,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
are, 1
a, 1
man, 1
of, 1
honor,, 1
Morrel,, 1
because, 1
you, 1
have, 1
taken, 1
an, 1
oath,, 1

are, 1
about, 1
to, 1
do, 1
so, 1
again.", 1
"Oh,, 1
count,, 1
have, 1
pity, 1
upon, 1
me., 1
I, 1
am, 1
so, 1
unhappy.", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
known, 1
a, 1
man, 1
much, 1
more, 1
unfortunate, 1
than, 1
you,, 1
Morrel.", 1
"Impossible!", 1
"Alas,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
infirmity, 1
of, 1
our, 1
nature, 1

to, 1
believe, 1
ourselves, 1
much, 1
more, 1
unhappy, 1

all, 1

"Listen,, 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
pay, 1
attention, 1
to, 1
what, 1
I, 1
am, 1
about, 1
to, 1
tell, 1
you., 1
I, 1
knew, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who, 1
like, 1
you, 1
had, 1
fixed, 1
all, 1
his, 1
hopes, 1
of, 1
happiness, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
woman., 1
He, 1
was, 1
young,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
an, 1
old, 1
father, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
loved,, 1
a, 1
betrothed, 1
bride, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
adored., 1
He, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
marry, 1
her,, 1
when, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
caprices, 1
of, 1
fate,--which, 1
would, 1
almost, 1
make, 1
us, 1
doubt, 1
the, 1
goodness, 1
of, 1
providence,, 1
if, 1
that, 1
providence, 1
did, 1
not, 1
afterwards, 1
reveal, 1
itself, 1
by, 1
proving, 1
that, 1
all, 1
is, 1
but, 1
a, 1
means, 1
of, 1
conducting, 1
to, 1
an, 1
end,--one, 1
of, 1
those, 1
caprices, 1
deprived, 1
him, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mistress,, 1
of, 1
the, 1
future, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
dreamed, 1
(for, 1
in, 1
his, 1
blindness, 1
he, 1
forgot, 1
he, 1
could, 1
only, 1
read, 1
the, 1
present),, 1
and, 1
cast, 1
him, 1
into, 1
a, 1
dungeon.", 1
"Ah,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"one, 1
quits, 1
a, 1
dungeon, 1
in, 1
a, 1
week,, 1
a, 1
month,, 1

a, 1
year.", 1
"He, 1
remained, 1
there, 1
fourteen, 1
years,, 1

said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
shoulder., 1
Maximilian, 1
shuddered., 1
"Fourteen, 1
years!", 1
he, 1
muttered--"Fourteen, 1
years!", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"During, 1
that, 1
time, 1
he, 1
had, 1
many, 1
moments, 1
of, 1
despair., 1
He, 1
also,, 1
Morrel,, 1
like, 1
you,, 1
considered, 1
himself, 1
the, 1
unhappiest, 1
of, 1
men.", 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"Well,, 1
at, 1
the, 1
height, 1
of, 1
his, 1
despair, 1
God, 1
assisted, 1
him, 1
through, 1
human, 1
means., 1
At, 1
first,, 1
perhaps,, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
recognize, 1
the, 1
infinite, 1
mercy, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Lord,, 1
but, 1
at, 1
last, 1
he, 1
took, 1
patience, 1
and, 1
waited., 1
One, 1
day, 1
he, 1
miraculously, 1
left, 1
the, 1
prison,, 1
transformed,, 1
rich,, 1
powerful., 1
His, 1
first, 1
cry, 1
was, 1
for, 1
his, 1
father;, 1
but, 1
that, 1
father, 1
was, 1
dead.", 1
"My, 1
father,, 1
too,, 1
is, 1
dead,", 1
said, 1
Morrel., 1
"Yes;, 1
but, 1
your, 1
father, 1
died, 1
in, 1
your, 1
arms,, 1
happy,, 1
respected,, 1
rich,, 1
and, 1
full, 1
of, 1
years;, 1
his, 1
father, 1
died, 1
poor,, 1
despairing,, 1
almost, 1
doubtful, 1
of, 1
providence;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
his, 1
son, 1
sought, 1
his, 1
grave, 1
ten, 1
years, 1
afterwards,, 1
his, 1
tomb, 1
had, 1
disappeared,, 1
and, 1
no, 1
one, 1
could, 1
say,, 1
'There, 1
sleeps, 1
the, 1
father, 1
you, 1
so, 1
well, 1
loved.'", 1
"Oh!", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel., 1
"He, 1
was,, 1
then,, 1
a, 1
more, 1
unhappy, 1
son, 1
than, 1
you,, 1
Morrel,, 1
for, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
even, 1
find, 1
his, 1
father's, 1
grave.", 1
"But, 1
then, 1
he, 1
had, 1
the, 1
woman, 1
he, 1
loved, 1
still, 1
remaining?", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
deceived,, 1
Morrel,, 1
that, 1
woman"--, 1
"She, 1
was, 1
dead?", 1
"Worse, 1
than, 1
that,, 1
she, 1
was, 1
faithless,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
married, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
persecutors, 1
of, 1
her, 1
betrothed., 1
You, 1
see,, 1
then,, 1
Morrel,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
more, 1
unhappy, 1
lover, 1
than, 1
you.", 1
"And, 1
has, 1
he, 1
found, 1
consolation?", 1
"He, 1
has, 1
at, 1
least, 1
found, 1
peace.", 1
"And, 1
does, 1
he, 1
ever, 1
expect, 1
to, 1
be, 1
happy?", 1
"He, 1
hopes, 1
so,, 1
Maximilian.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
head, 1
fell, 1
on, 1
his, 1
breast., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
my, 1
promise,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
after, 1
a, 1
minute's, 1
pause,, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
"Only, 1
remember"--, 1
"On, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
October,, 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
expect, 1
you, 1

the, 1
Island, 1

On, 1
the, 1
4th, 1

"But,, 1
count,, 1
do, 1
you, 1
remember, 1
that, 1
the, 1
5th, 1
of, 1
October"--, 1
"Child,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"not, 1

know, 1

"Do, 1

"Yes;, 1

business, 1
in, 1
Italy., 1
I, 1

"When, 1
do, 1
you, 1
leave?", 1
"Immediately;, 1
the, 1
steamer, 1
waits,, 1

in, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
I, 1
shall, 1

Will, 1
you, 1
accompany, 1
me, 1
to, 1
the, 1
harbor,, 1
Maximilian?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
entirely, 1
yours,, 1
count.", 1
Morrel, 1
accompanied, 1
the, 1
count, 1
to, 1
the, 1
harbor., 1
The, 1
white, 1
steam, 1
was, 1
ascending, 1
like, 1
a, 1
plume, 1
of, 1
feathers, 1
from, 1
the, 1
black, 1
chimney., 1
The, 1
steamer, 1
soon, 1
disappeared,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
afterwards,, 1
as, 1
the, 1
count, 1
had, 1
said,, 1
was, 1
scarcely, 1
distinguishable, 1
in, 1
the, 1
horizon, 1
amidst, 1
the, 1
fogs, 1
of, 1
the, 1
night., 1
Chapter, 1
114., 1
Peppino., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
that, 1
the, 1
steamer, 1
disappeared, 1
behind, 1
Cape, 1
Morgion,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
travelling, 1
post, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
from, 1
Florence, 1
to, 1
Rome, 1
had, 1
just, 1
passed, 1
the, 1
little, 1
town, 1
of, 1
Aquapendente., 1
He, 1
was, 1
travelling, 1
fast, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
cover, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal, 1
of, 1
ground, 1
without, 1
exciting, 1
suspicion., 1
This, 1
man, 1
was, 1
dressed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
greatcoat,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
a, 1
surtout,, 1
a, 1
little, 1
worse, 1
for, 1
the, 1
journey,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
exhibited, 1
the, 1
ribbon, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Legion, 1
of, 1
Honor, 1
still, 1
fresh, 1
and, 1
brilliant,, 1
a, 1
decoration, 1
which, 1
also, 1
ornamented, 1
the, 1
under, 1
coat., 1
He, 1
might, 1
be, 1
recognized,, 1
not, 1
only, 1
by, 1
these, 1
signs,, 1
but, 1
also, 1
from, 1
the, 1
accent, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
spoke, 1
to, 1
the, 1
postilion,, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Frenchman., 1
Another, 1
proof, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
a, 1
native, 1
of, 1
the, 1
universal, 1
country, 1
was, 1
apparent, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
of, 1
his, 1
knowing, 1
no, 1
other, 1
Italian, 1
words, 1
than, 1
the, 1
terms, 1
used, 1
in, 1
music,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
like, 1
the, 1
"goddam", 1
of, 1
Figaro,, 1
served, 1
all, 1
possible, 1
linguistic, 1
requirements., 1
"Allegro!", 1
he, 1
called, 1
out, 1
to, 1
the, 1
postilions, 1
at, 1
every, 1
ascent., 1
"Moderato!", 1
he, 1
cried, 1
as, 1
they, 1
descended., 1
And, 1
heaven, 1
knows, 1
there, 1
are, 1
hills, 1
enough, 1
between, 1
Rome, 1
and, 1
Florence, 1
by, 1
the, 1
way, 1
of, 1
Aquapendente!, 1
These, 1
two, 1
words, 1
greatly, 1
amused, 1
the, 1
men, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
they, 1
were, 1
addressed., 1
On, 1
reaching, 1
La, 1
Storta,, 1
the, 1
point, 1
from, 1
whence, 1
Rome, 1
is, 1
first, 1
visible,, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
evinced, 1
none, 1
of, 1
the, 1
enthusiastic, 1
curiosity, 1
which, 1
usually, 1
leads, 1
strangers, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
up, 1
and, 1
endeavor, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dome, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Peter's,, 1
which, 1
may, 1
be, 1
seen, 1
long, 1
before, 1
any, 1
other, 1
object, 1
is, 1
distinguishable., 1
No,, 1
he, 1
merely, 1
drew, 1
a, 1
pocketbook, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
from, 1
it, 1
a, 1
paper, 1
folded, 1
in, 1
four,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
having, 1
examined, 1
it, 1
in, 1
a, 1
manner, 1
almost, 1
reverential,, 1
he, 1
said--"Good!, 1
I, 1
have, 1
it, 1
still!", 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
entered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
Porto, 1
del, 1
Popolo,, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
stopped, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Hotel, 1
d'Espagne., 1
Old, 1
Pastrini,, 1
our, 1
former, 1
acquaintance,, 1
received, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
hat, 1
in, 1
hand., 1
The, 1
traveller, 1
alighted,, 1
ordered, 1
a, 1
good, 1
dinner,, 1
and, 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
address, 1
of, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
immediately, 1
given, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
most, 1
celebrated, 1
in, 1
Rome., 1
It, 1
was, 1
situated, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Via, 1
dei, 1
Banchi,, 1
near, 1
St., 1
Peter's., 1
In, 1
Rome,, 1
as, 1
everywhere, 1
else,, 1
the, 1
arrival, 1
of, 1
a, 1
post-chaise, 1
is, 1
an, 1
event., 1
Ten, 1
young, 1
descendants, 1
of, 1
Marius, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Gracchi,, 1
barefooted, 1
and, 1
out, 1
at, 1
elbows,, 1
with, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
resting, 1
on, 1
the, 1
hip, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
gracefully, 1
curved, 1
above, 1
the, 1
head,, 1
stared, 1
at, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
the, 1
post-chaise,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
horses;, 1
to, 1
these, 1
were, 1
added, 1
about, 1
fifty, 1
little, 1
vagabonds, 1
from, 1
the, 1
Papal, 1
States,, 1
who, 1
earned, 1
a, 1
pittance, 1
by, 1
diving, 1
into, 1
the, 1
Tiber, 1
at, 1
high, 1
water, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bridge, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Angelo., 1
Now,, 1
as, 1
these, 1
street, 1
Arabs, 1
of, 1
Rome,, 1
more, 1
fortunate, 1
than, 1
those, 1
of, 1
Paris,, 1
understand, 1
every, 1
language,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
the, 1
French,, 1
they, 1
heard, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
order, 1
an, 1
apartment,, 1
a, 1
dinner,, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
inquire, 1
the, 1
way, 1
to, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French., 1
The, 1
result, 1
was, 1
that, 1
when, 1
the, 1
new-comer, 1
left, 1
the, 1
hotel, 1
with, 1
the, 1
cicerone,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
detached, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
of, 1
the, 1
idlers,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
having, 1
been, 1
seen, 1
by, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
and, 1
appearing, 1
to, 1
excite, 1
no, 1
attention, 1
from, 1
the, 1
guide,, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
stranger, 1
with, 1
as, 1
much, 1
skill, 1
as, 1
a, 1
Parisian, 1
police, 1
agent, 1
would, 1
have, 1
used., 1
The, 1
Frenchman, 1
had, 1
been, 1
so, 1
impatient, 1
to, 1
reach, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
to, 1
be, 1
harnessed,, 1
but, 1
left, 1
word, 1
for, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
to, 1
overtake, 1
him, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
or, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
for, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bankers', 1
door., 1
He, 1
reached, 1
it, 1
before, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
arrived., 1
The, 1
Frenchman, 1
entered,, 1
leaving, 1
in, 1
the, 1
anteroom, 1
his, 1
guide,, 1
who, 1
immediately, 1
entered, 1
into, 1
conversation, 1
with, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
of, 1
the, 1
industrious, 1
idlers, 1
who, 1
are, 1
always, 1
to, 1
be, 1
found, 1
in, 1
Rome, 1
at, 1
the, 1
doors, 1
of, 1
banking-houses,, 1
churches,, 1
museums,, 1
or, 1
theatres., 1
With, 1
the, 1
Frenchman,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
him, 1
entered, 1
too;, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
knocked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
inner, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
first, 1
room;, 1
his, 1
shadow, 1
did, 1
the, 1
same., 1
"Messrs., 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French?", 1
inquired, 1
the, 1
stranger., 1
An, 1
attendant, 1
arose, 1
at, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
a, 1
confidential, 1
clerk, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
desk., 1
"Whom, 1
shall, 1
I, 1
announce?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
attendant., 1
"Baron, 1
Danglars.", 1
"Follow, 1
me,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man., 1
A, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
the, 1
attendant, 1
and, 1
the, 1
baron, 1
disappeared., 1
The, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
followed, 1
Danglars, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
on, 1
a, 1
bench., 1
The, 1
clerk, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
write, 1
for, 1
the, 1
next, 1
five, 1
minutes;, 1
the, 1
man, 1
preserved, 1
profound, 1
silence,, 1
and, 1
remained, 1
perfectly, 1
motionless., 1
Then, 1
the, 1
pen, 1
of, 1
the, 1
clerk, 1
ceased, 1
to, 1
move, 1
over, 1
the, 1
paper;, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
and, 1
appearing, 1
to, 1
be, 1
perfectly, 1
sure, 1
of, 1
privacy,--"Ah,, 1
ha,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"here, 1
you, 1
are,, 1
Peppino!", 1
"Yes,", 1
was, 1
the, 1
laconic, 1
reply., 1
"You, 1
have, 1
found, 1
out, 1
that, 1
there, 1
is, 1
something, 1
worth, 1
having, 1
about, 1
this, 1
large, 1
gentleman?", 1
"There, 1
is, 1
no, 1
great, 1
merit, 1
due, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
for, 1
we, 1
were, 1
informed, 1
of, 1
it.", 1
"You, 1
know, 1
his, 1
business, 1
here,, 1
then.", 1
"Pardieu,, 1
he, 1
has, 1
come, 1
to, 1
draw,, 1
but, 1
I, 1
don't, 1
know, 1
how, 1
much!", 1
"You, 1
will, 1
know, 1
presently,, 1
my, 1
friend.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
only, 1
do, 1
not, 1
give, 1
me, 1
false, 1
information, 1
as, 1
you, 1
did, 1
the, 1
other, 1
day.", 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?--of, 1
whom, 1
do, 1
you, 1
speak?, 1
Was, 1
it, 1
the, 1
Englishman, 1
who, 1
carried, 1
off, 1
3,000, 1
crowns, 1
from, 1
here, 1
the, 1
other, 1
day?", 1
"No;, 1
he, 1
really, 1
had, 1
3,000, 1
crowns,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
found, 1
them., 1
I, 1
mean, 1
the, 1
Russian, 1
prince,, 1
who, 1
you, 1
said, 1
had, 1
30,000, 1
livres,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
only, 1
found, 1
22,000.", 1
"You, 1
must, 1
have, 1
searched, 1
badly.", 1
"Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
himself, 1
searched.", 1
"Indeed?, 1
But, 1
you, 1
must, 1
let, 1
me, 1
make, 1
my, 1
observations,, 1
or, 1
the, 1
Frenchman, 1
will, 1
transact, 1
his, 1
business, 1
without, 1
my, 1
knowing, 1
the, 1
sum.", 1
Peppino, 1
nodded,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
a, 1
rosary, 1
from, 1
his, 1
pocket, 1
began, 1
to, 1
mutter, 1
a, 1
few, 1
prayers, 1
while, 1
the, 1
clerk, 1
disappeared, 1
through, 1
the, 1
same, 1
door, 1
by, 1
which, 1
Danglars, 1
and, 1
the, 1
attendant, 1
had, 1
gone, 1
out., 1
At, 1
the, 1
expiration, 1
of, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
the, 1
clerk, 1
returned, 1
with, 1
a, 1
beaming, 1
countenance., 1
"Well?", 1
asked, 1
Peppino, 1
of, 1
his, 1
friend., 1
"Joy,, 1
joy--the, 1
sum, 1
is, 1
large!", 1
"Five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
millions,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
not?", 1
"Yes,, 1
you, 1
know, 1
the, 1
amount.", 1
"On, 1
the, 1
receipt, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
"Why,, 1
how, 1
came, 1
you, 1
to, 1
be, 1
so, 1
well, 1
acquainted, 1
with, 1
all, 1
this?", 1
"I, 1
told, 1
you, 1
we, 1
were, 1
informed, 1
beforehand.", 1
"Then, 1
why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
apply, 1
to, 1
me?", 1
"That, 1
I, 1
may, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
I, 1
have, 1
the, 1
right, 1
man.", 1
"Yes,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
indeed, 1
he., 1
Five, 1
millions--a, 1
pretty, 1
sum,, 1
eh,, 1
Peppino?", 1
"Hush--here, 1
is, 1
our, 1
man!", 1
The, 1
clerk, 1
seized, 1
his, 1
pen,, 1
and, 1
Peppino, 1
his, 1
beads;, 1
one, 1
was, 1
writing, 1
and, 1
the, 1
other, 1
praying, 1
when, 1
the, 1
door, 1
opened., 1
Danglars, 1
looked, 1
radiant, 1
with, 1
joy;, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
accompanied, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
Peppino, 1
followed, 1
Danglars., 1
According, 1
to, 1
the, 1
arrangements,, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
waiting, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
The, 1
guide, 1
held, 1
the, 1
door, 1
open., 1
Guides, 1
are, 1
useful, 1
people,, 1
who, 1
will, 1
turn, 1
their, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
anything., 1
Danglars, 1
leaped, 1
into, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
like, 1
a, 1
young, 1
man, 1
of, 1
twenty., 1
The, 1
cicerone, 1
reclosed, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
sprang, 1
up, 1
by, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coachman., 1
Peppino, 1
mounted, 1
the, 1
seat, 1
behind., 1
"Will, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
visit, 1
St., 1
Peter's?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
cicerone., 1
"I, 1
did, 1
not, 1
come, 1
to, 1
Rome, 1
to, 1
see,", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
aloud;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
added, 1
softly,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
avaricious, 1
smile,, 1
"I, 1
came, 1
to, 1
touch!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
rapped, 1
his, 1
pocket-book,, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
just, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
letter., 1
"Then, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
is, 1
going"--, 1
"To, 1
the, 1
hotel.", 1
"Casa, 1
Pastrini!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
cicerone, 1
to, 1
the, 1
coachman,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
drove, 1
rapidly, 1
on., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
baron, 1
entered, 1
his, 1
apartment,, 1
and, 1
Peppino, 1
stationed, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
bench, 1
outside, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hotel,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
whispered, 1
something, 1
in, 1
the, 1
ear, 1
of, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
descendants, 1
of, 1
Marius, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Gracchi, 1
whom, 1
we, 1
noticed, 1
at, 1
the, 1
beginning, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chapter,, 1
who, 1
immediately, 1
ran, 1
down, 1
the, 1
road, 1
leading, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Capitol, 1
at, 1
his, 1
fullest, 1
speed., 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
tired, 1
and, 1
sleepy;, 1
he, 1
therefore, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
pocketbook, 1
under, 1
his, 1
pillow., 1
Peppino, 1
had, 1
a, 1
little, 1
spare, 1
time,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
had, 1
a, 1
game, 1
of, 1
mora, 1
with, 1
the, 1
facchini,, 1
lost, 1
three, 1
crowns,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
to, 1
console, 1
himself, 1
drank, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
Orvieto., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
Danglars, 1
awoke, 1
late,, 1
though, 1
he, 1
went, 1
to, 1
bed, 1
so, 1
early;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
not, 1
slept, 1
well, 1
for, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
nights,, 1
even, 1
if, 1
he, 1
had, 1
slept, 1
at, 1
all., 1
He, 1
breakfasted, 1
heartily,, 1
and, 1
caring, 1
little,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
for, 1
the, 1
beauties, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Eternal, 1
City,, 1
ordered, 1
post-horses, 1
at, 1
noon., 1
But, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
not, 1
reckoned, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
formalities, 1
of, 1
the, 1
police, 1
and, 1
the, 1
idleness, 1
of, 1
the, 1
posting-master., 1
The, 1
horses, 1
only, 1
arrived, 1
at, 1
two, 1
o'clock,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
cicerone, 1
did, 1
not, 1
bring, 1
the, 1
passport, 1
till, 1
three., 1
All, 1
these, 1
preparations, 1
had, 1
collected, 1
a, 1
number, 1
of, 1
idlers, 1
round, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini's;, 1
the, 1
descendants, 1
of, 1
Marius, 1
and, 1
the, 1
Gracchi, 1
were, 1
also, 1
not, 1
wanting., 1
The, 1
baron, 1
walked, 1
triumphantly, 1
through, 1
the, 1
crowd,, 1
who, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sake, 1
of, 1
gain, 1
styled, 1
him, 1
"your, 1
excellency.", 1
As, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
hitherto, 1
contented, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
being, 1
called, 1
a, 1
baron,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
rather, 1
flattered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
title, 1
of, 1
excellency,, 1
and, 1
distributed, 1
a, 1
dozen, 1
silver, 1
coins, 1
among, 1
the, 1
beggars,, 1
who, 1
were, 1
ready,, 1
for, 1
twelve, 1
more,, 1
to, 1
call, 1
him, 1
"your, 1
highness.", 1
"Which, 1
road?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
postilion, 1
in, 1
Italian., 1
"The, 1
Ancona, 1
road,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
baron., 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
interpreted, 1
the, 1
question, 1
and, 1
answer,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
galloped, 1
off., 1
Danglars, 1
intended, 1
travelling, 1
to, 1
Venice,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
would, 1
receive, 1
one, 1
part, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fortune,, 1
and, 1
then, 1
proceeding, 1
to, 1
Vienna,, 1
where, 1
he, 1
would, 1
find, 1
the, 1
rest,, 1
he, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
take, 1
up, 1
his, 1
residence, 1
in, 1
the, 1
latter, 1
town,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
told, 1
was, 1
a, 1
city, 1
of, 1
pleasure., 1
He, 1
had, 1
scarcely, 1
advanced, 1
three, 1
leagues, 1
out, 1
of, 1
Rome, 1
when, 1
daylight, 1
began, 1
to, 1
disappear., 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
not, 1
intended, 1
starting, 1
so, 1
late,, 1
or, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
remained;, 1
he, 1
put, 1
his, 1
head, 1
out, 1
and, 1
asked, 1
the, 1
postilion, 1
how, 1
long, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
before, 1
they, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
next, 1
town., 1
"Non, 1
capisco", 1
(do, 1
not, 1
understand),, 1
was, 1
the, 1
reply., 1
Danglars, 1
bent, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
meant, 1
to, 1
imply,, 1
"Very, 1
well.", 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
again, 1
moved, 1
on., 1
"I, 1
will, 1
stop, 1
at, 1
the, 1
first, 1
posting-house,", 1
said, 1
Danglars, 1
to, 1
himself., 1
He, 1
still, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
same, 1
self-satisfaction, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
experienced, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
evening,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
had, 1
procured, 1
him, 1
so, 1
good, 1
a, 1
night's, 1
rest., 1
He, 1
was, 1
luxuriously, 1
stretched, 1
in, 1
a, 1
good, 1
English, 1
calash,, 1
with, 1
double, 1
springs;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
drawn, 1
by, 1
four, 1
good, 1
horses,, 1
at, 1
full, 1
gallop;, 1
he, 1
knew, 1
the, 1
relay, 1
to, 1
be, 1
at, 1
a, 1
distance, 1
of, 1
seven, 1
leagues., 1
What, 1
subject, 1
of, 1
meditation, 1
could, 1
present, 1
itself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
banker,, 1
so, 1
fortunately, 1
become, 1
bankrupt?, 1
Danglars, 1
thought, 1
for, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
about, 1
his, 1
wife, 1
in, 1
Paris;, 1
another, 1
ten, 1
minutes, 1
about, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
travelling, 1
with, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
d'Armilly;, 1
the, 1
same, 1
period, 1
was, 1
given, 1
to, 1
his, 1
creditors,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
manner, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
intended, 1
spending, 1
their, 1
money;, 1
and, 1
then,, 1
having, 1
no, 1
subject, 1
left, 1
for, 1
contemplation,, 1
he, 1
shut, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
asleep., 1
Now, 1
and, 1
then, 1
a, 1
jolt, 1
more, 1
violent, 1
than, 1
the, 1
rest, 1
caused, 1
him, 1
to, 1
open, 1
his, 1
eyes;, 1
then, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
still, 1
being, 1
carried, 1
with, 1
great, 1
rapidity, 1
over, 1
the, 1
same, 1
country,, 1
thickly, 1
strewn, 1
with, 1
broken, 1
aqueducts,, 1
which, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
granite, 1
giants, 1
petrified, 1
while, 1
running, 1
a, 1
race., 1
But, 1
the, 1
night, 1
was, 1
cold,, 1
dull,, 1
and, 1
rainy,, 1
and, 1
it, 1
was, 1
much, 1
more, 1
pleasant, 1
for, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
to, 1
remain, 1
in, 1
the, 1
warm, 1
carriage, 1
than, 1
to, 1
put, 1
his, 1
head, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
window, 1
to, 1
make, 1
inquiries, 1
of, 1
a, 1
postilion, 1
whose, 1
only, 1
answer, 1
was, 1
"Non, 1
capisco.", 1
Danglars, 1
therefore, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
sleep,, 1
saying, 1
to, 1
himself, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
sure, 1
to, 1
awake, 1
at, 1
the, 1
posting-house., 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
stopped., 1
Danglars, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
long-desired, 1
point;, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
through, 1
the, 1
window,, 1
expecting, 1
to, 1
find, 1
himself, 1
in, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
some, 1
town,, 1
or, 1
at, 1
least, 1
village;, 1
but, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
except, 1
what, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
a, 1
ruin,, 1
where, 1
three, 1
or, 1
four, 1
men, 1
went, 1
and, 1
came, 1
like, 1
shadows., 1
Danglars, 1
waited, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
expecting, 1
the, 1
postilion, 1
to, 1
come, 1
and, 1
demand, 1
payment, 1
with, 1
the, 1
termination, 1
of, 1
his, 1
stage., 1
He, 1
intended, 1
taking, 1
advantage, 1
of, 1
the, 1
opportunity, 1
to, 1
make, 1
fresh, 1
inquiries, 1
of, 1
the, 1
new, 1
conductor;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
horses, 1
were, 1
unharnessed,, 1
and, 1
others, 1
put, 1
in, 1
their, 1
places,, 1
without, 1
any, 1
one, 1
claiming, 1
money, 1
from, 1
the, 1
traveller., 1
Danglars,, 1
astonished,, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
but, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
hand, 1
pushed, 1
him, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
on., 1
The, 1
baron, 1
was, 1
completely, 1
roused., 1
"Eh?", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
postilion,, 1
"eh,, 1
mio, 1
caro?", 1
This, 1
was, 1
another, 1
little, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
Italian, 1
the, 1
baron, 1
had, 1
learned, 1
from, 1
hearing, 1
his, 1
daughter, 1
sing, 1
Italian, 1
duets, 1
with, 1
Cavalcanti., 1
But, 1
mio, 1
caro, 1
did, 1
not, 1
reply., 1
Danglars, 1
then, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
window., 1
"Come,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
thrusting, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
through, 1
the, 1
opening,, 1
"where, 1
are, 1
we, 1
going?", 1
"Dentro, 1
la, 1
testa!", 1
answered, 1
a, 1
solemn, 1
and, 1
imperious, 1
voice,, 1
accompanied, 1
by, 1
a, 1
menacing, 1
gesture., 1
Danglars, 1
thought, 1
dentro, 1
la, 1
testa, 1
meant,, 1
"Put, 1
in, 1
your, 1
head!", 1
He, 1
was, 1
making, 1
rapid, 1
progress, 1
in, 1
Italian., 1
He, 1
obeyed,, 1
not, 1
without, 1
some, 1
uneasiness,, 1
which,, 1
momentarily, 1
increasing,, 1
caused, 1
his, 1
mind,, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
being, 1
as, 1
unoccupied, 1
as, 1
it, 1
was, 1
when, 1
he, 1
began, 1
his, 1
journey,, 1
to, 1
fill, 1
with, 1
ideas, 1
which, 1
were, 1
very, 1
likely, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
a, 1
traveller, 1
awake,, 1
more, 1
especially, 1
one, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
situation, 1
as, 1
Danglars., 1
His, 1
eyes, 1
acquired, 1
that, 1
quality, 1
which, 1
in, 1
the, 1
first, 1
moment, 1
of, 1
strong, 1
emotion, 1
enables, 1
them, 1
to, 1
see, 1
distinctly,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
afterwards, 1
fails, 1
from, 1
being, 1
too, 1
much, 1
taxed., 1
Before, 1
we, 1
are, 1
alarmed,, 1
we, 1
see, 1
correctly;, 1
when, 1
we, 1
are, 1
alarmed,, 1
we, 1
see, 1
double;, 1
and, 1
when, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
alarmed,, 1
we, 1
see, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
trouble., 1
Danglars, 1
observed, 1
a, 1
man, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cloak, 1
galloping, 1
at, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage., 1
"Some, 1
gendarme!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed., 1
"Can, 1
I, 1
have, 1
been, 1
intercepted, 1
by, 1
French, 1
telegrams, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pontifical, 1
authorities?", 1
He, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
end, 1
his, 1
anxiety., 1
"Where, 1
are, 1
you, 1
taking, 1
me?", 1
he, 1
asked., 1
"Dentro, 1
la, 1
testa,", 1
replied, 1
the, 1
same, 1
voice,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
menacing, 1
accent., 1
Danglars, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
left;, 1
another, 1
man, 1
on, 1
horseback, 1
was, 1
galloping, 1
on, 1
that, 1
side., 1
"Decidedly,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
with, 1
the, 1
perspiration, 1
on, 1
his, 1
forehead,, 1
"I, 1
must, 1
be, 1
under, 1
arrest.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
back, 1
in, 1
the, 1
calash,, 1
not, 1
this, 1
time, 1
to, 1
sleep,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
think., 1
Directly, 1
afterwards, 1
the, 1
moon, 1
rose., 1
He, 1
then, 1
saw, 1
the, 1
great, 1
aqueducts,, 1
those, 1
stone, 1
phantoms, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
before, 1
remarked,, 1
only, 1
then, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
right, 1
hand,, 1
now, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
left., 1
He, 1
understood, 1
that, 1
they, 1
had, 1
described, 1
a, 1
circle,, 1
and, 1
were, 1
bringing, 1
him, 1
back, 1
to, 1
Rome., 1
"Oh,, 1
unfortunate!", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"they, 1
must, 1
have, 1
obtained, 1
my, 1
arrest.", 1
The, 1
carriage, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
roll, 1
on, 1
with, 1
frightful, 1
speed., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
of, 1
terror, 1
elapsed,, 1
for, 1
every, 1
spot, 1
they, 1
passed, 1
showed, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
on, 1
the, 1
road, 1
back., 1
At, 1
length, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
mass,, 1
against, 1
which, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
dash;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
vehicle, 1
turned, 1
to, 1
one, 1
side,, 1
leaving, 1
the, 1
barrier, 1
behind, 1
and, 1
Danglars, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
it, 1
was, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
ramparts, 1
encircling, 1
Rome., 1
"Mon, 1
dieu!", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1
"we, 1
are, 1
not, 1
returning, 1
to, 1
Rome;, 1
then, 1
it, 1
is, 1
not, 1
justice, 1
which, 1
is, 1
pursuing, 1
me!, 1
Gracious, 1
heavens;, 1
another, 1
idea, 1
presents, 1
itself--what, 1
if, 1
they, 1
should, 1
be"--, 1
His, 1
hair, 1
stood, 1
on, 1
end., 1
He, 1
remembered, 1
those, 1
interesting, 1
stories,, 1
so, 1
little, 1
believed, 1
in, 1
Paris,, 1
respecting, 1
Roman, 1
bandits;, 1
he, 1
remembered, 1
the, 1
adventures, 1
that, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
related, 1
when, 1
it, 1
was, 1
intended, 1
that, 1
he, 1
should, 1
marry, 1
Mademoiselle, 1
Eugenie., 1
"They, 1
are, 1
robbers,, 1
perhaps,", 1
he, 1
muttered., 1
Just, 1
then, 1
the, 1
carriage, 1
rolled, 1
on, 1
something, 1
harder, 1
than, 1
gravel, 1
road., 1
Danglars, 1
hazarded, 1
a, 1
look, 1
on, 1
both, 1
sides, 1
of, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
perceived, 1
monuments, 1
of, 1
a, 1
singular, 1
form,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
now, 1
recalled, 1
all, 1
the, 1
details, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
related,, 1
and, 1
comparing, 1
them, 1
with, 1
his, 1
own, 1
situation,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
sure, 1
that, 1
he, 1
must, 1
be, 1
on, 1
the, 1
Appian, 1
Way., 1
On, 1
the, 1
left,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
sort, 1
of, 1
valley,, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
circular, 1
excavation., 1
It, 1
was, 1
Caracalla's, 1
circus., 1
On, 1
a, 1
word, 1
from, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
rode, 1
at, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
the, 1
carriage,, 1
it, 1
stopped., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
the, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened., 1
"Scendi!", 1
exclaimed, 1
a, 1
commanding, 1
voice., 1
Danglars, 1
instantly, 1
descended;, 1
although, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
yet, 1
speak, 1
Italian,, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
it, 1
very, 1
well., 1
More, 1
dead, 1
than, 1
alive,, 1
he, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
him., 1
Four, 1
men, 1
surrounded, 1
him,, 1
besides, 1
the, 1
postilion., 1
"Di, 1
qua,", 1
said, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
men,, 1
descending, 1
a, 1
little, 1
path, 1
leading, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Appian, 1
Way., 1
Danglars, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
guide, 1
without, 1
opposition,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
no, 1
occasion, 1
to, 1
turn, 1
around, 1
to, 1
see, 1
whether, 1
the, 1
three, 1
others, 1
were, 1
following, 1
him., 1
Still, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
as, 1
though, 1
they, 1
were, 1
stationed, 1
at, 1
equal, 1
distances, 1
from, 1
one, 1
another,, 1
like, 1
sentinels., 1
After, 1
walking, 1
for, 1
about, 1
ten, 1
minutes,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Danglars, 1
did, 1
not, 1
exchange, 1
a, 1
single, 1
word, 1
with, 1
his, 1
guide,, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
between, 1
a, 1
hillock, 1
and, 1
a, 1
clump, 1
of, 1
high, 1
weeds;, 1
three, 1
men,, 1
standing, 1
silent,, 1
formed, 1
a, 1
triangle,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
the, 1
centre., 1
He, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
speak,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
refused, 1
to, 1
move., 1
"Avanti!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
same, 1
sharp, 1
and, 1
imperative, 1
voice., 1
This, 1
time, 1
Danglars, 1
had, 1
double, 1
reason, 1
to, 1
understand,, 1
for, 1
if, 1
the, 1
word, 1
and, 1
gesture, 1
had, 1
not, 1
explained, 1
the, 1
speaker's, 1
meaning,, 1
it, 1
was, 1
clearly, 1
expressed, 1
by, 1
the, 1
man, 1
walking, 1
behind, 1
him,, 1
who, 1
pushed, 1
him, 1
so, 1
rudely, 1
that, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
against, 1
the, 1
guide., 1
This, 1
guide, 1
was, 1
our, 1
friend, 1
Peppino,, 1
who, 1
dashed, 1
into, 1
the, 1
thicket, 1
of, 1
high, 1
weeds,, 1
through, 1
a, 1
path, 1
which, 1
none, 1
but, 1
lizards, 1
or, 1
polecats, 1
could, 1
have, 1
imagined, 1
to, 1
be, 1
an, 1
open, 1
road., 1
Peppino, 1
stopped, 1
before, 1
a, 1
pit, 1
overhung, 1
by, 1
thick, 1
hedges;, 1
the, 1
pit,, 1
half, 1
open,, 1
afforded, 1
a, 1
passage, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
disappeared, 1
like, 1
the, 1
evil, 1
spirits, 1
in, 1
the, 1
fairy, 1
tales., 1
The, 1
voice, 1
and, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
followed, 1
Danglars, 1
ordered, 1
him, 1
to, 1
do, 1
the, 1
same., 1
There, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
any, 1
doubt,, 1
the, 1
bankrupt, 1
was, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Roman, 1
banditti., 1
Danglars, 1
acquitted, 1
himself, 1
like, 1
a, 1
man, 1
placed, 1
between, 1
two, 1
dangerous, 1
positions,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
is, 1
rendered, 1
brave, 1
by, 1
fear., 1
Notwithstanding, 1
his, 1
large, 1
stomach,, 1
certainly, 1
not, 1
intended, 1
to, 1
penetrate, 1
the, 1
fissures, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Campagna,, 1
he, 1
slid, 1
down, 1
like, 1
Peppino,, 1
and, 1
closing, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
fell, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
feet., 1
As, 1
he, 1
touched, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
The, 1
path, 1
was, 1
wide,, 1
but, 1
dark., 1
Peppino,, 1
who, 1
cared, 1
little, 1
for, 1
being, 1
recognized, 1
now, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
in, 1
his, 1
own, 1
territories,, 1
struck, 1
a, 1
light, 1
and, 1
lit, 1
a, 1
torch., 1
Two, 1
other, 1
men, 1
descended, 1
after, 1
Danglars, 1
forming, 1
the, 1
rearguard,, 1
and, 1
pushing, 1
Danglars, 1
whenever, 1
he, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
stop,, 1
they, 1
came, 1
by, 1
a, 1
gentle, 1
declivity, 1
to, 1
the, 1
intersection, 1
of, 1
two, 1
corridors., 1
The, 1
walls, 1
were, 1
hollowed, 1
out, 1
in, 1
sepulchres,, 1
one, 1
above, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
seemed, 1
in, 1
contrast, 1
with, 1
the, 1
white, 1
stones, 1
to, 1
open, 1
their, 1
large, 1
dark, 1
eyes,, 1
like, 1
those, 1
which, 1
we, 1
see, 1
on, 1
the, 1
faces, 1
of, 1
the, 1
dead., 1
A, 1
sentinel, 1
struck, 1
the, 1
rings, 1
of, 1
his, 1
carbine, 1
against, 1
his, 1
left, 1
hand., 1
"Who, 1
comes, 1
there?", 1
he, 1
cried., 1
"A, 1
friend,, 1
a, 1
friend!", 1
said, 1
Peppino;, 1
"but, 1
where, 1
is, 1
the, 1
captain?", 1
"There,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
sentinel,, 1
pointing, 1
over, 1
his, 1
shoulder, 1
to, 1
a, 1
spacious, 1
crypt,, 1
hollowed, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock,, 1
the, 1
lights, 1
from, 1
which, 1
shone, 1
into, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
through, 1
the, 1
large, 1
arched, 1
openings., 1
"Fine, 1
spoil,, 1
captain,, 1
fine, 1
spoil!", 1
said, 1
Peppino, 1
in, 1
Italian,, 1
and, 1
taking, 1
Danglars, 1
by, 1
the, 1
collar, 1
of, 1
his, 1
coat, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
him, 1
to, 1
an, 1
opening, 1
resembling, 1
a, 1
door,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
they, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
apartment, 1
which, 1
the, 1
captain, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
have, 1
made, 1
his, 1
dwelling-place., 1
"Is, 1
this, 1
the, 1
man?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
attentively, 1
reading, 1
Plutarch's, 1
"Life, 1
of, 1
Alexander.", 1
"Himself,, 1
captain--himself.", 1
"Very, 1
well,, 1
show, 1
him, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
At, 1
this, 1
rather, 1
impertinent, 1
order,, 1
Peppino, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
torch, 1
to, 1
the, 1
face, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
hastily, 1
withdrew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
not, 1
have, 1
his, 1
eyelashes, 1
burnt., 1
His, 1
agitated, 1
features, 1
presented, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
pale, 1
and, 1
hideous, 1
terror., 1
"The, 1
man, 1
is, 1
tired,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"conduct, 1
him, 1
to, 1
his, 1
bed.", 1
"Oh,", 1
murmured, 1
Danglars,, 1
"that, 1
bed, 1
is, 1
probably, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
coffins, 1
hollowed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
wall,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sleep, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
enjoy, 1
will, 1
be, 1
death, 1
from, 1
one, 1
of, 1
the, 1
poniards, 1
I, 1
see, 1
glistening, 1
in, 1
the, 1
darkness.", 1
From, 1
their, 1
beds, 1
of, 1
dried, 1
leaves, 1
or, 1
wolf-skins, 1
at, 1
the, 1
back, 1
of, 1
the, 1
chamber, 1
now, 1
arose, 1
the, 1
companions, 1
of, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
found, 1
by, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
reading, 1
"Caesar's, 1
Commentaries,", 1
and, 1
by, 1
Danglars, 1
studying, 1
the, 1
"Life, 1
of, 1
Alexander.", 1
The, 1
banker, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
groan, 1
and, 1
followed, 1
his, 1
guide;, 1
he, 1
neither, 1
supplicated, 1
nor, 1
exclaimed., 1
He, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
possessed, 1
strength,, 1
will,, 1
power,, 1
or, 1
feeling;, 1
he, 1
followed, 1
where, 1
they, 1
led, 1
him., 1
At, 1
length, 1
he, 1
found, 1
himself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
foot, 1
of, 1
a, 1
staircase,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
mechanically, 1
lifted, 1
his, 1
foot, 1
five, 1
or, 1
six, 1
times., 1
Then, 1
a, 1
low, 1
door, 1
was, 1
opened, 1
before, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
bending, 1
his, 1
head, 1
to, 1
avoid, 1
striking, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
a, 1
small, 1
room, 1
cut, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
rock., 1
The, 1
cell, 1
was, 1
clean,, 1
though, 1
empty,, 1
and, 1
dry,, 1
though, 1
situated, 1
at, 1
an, 1
immeasurable, 1
distance, 1
under, 1
the, 1
earth., 1
A, 1
bed, 1
of, 1
dried, 1
grass, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
goat-skins, 1
was, 1
placed, 1
in, 1
one, 1
corner., 1
Danglars, 1
brightened, 1
up, 1
on, 1
beholding, 1
it,, 1
fancying, 1
that, 1
it, 1
gave, 1
some, 1
promise, 1
of, 1
safety., 1
"Oh,, 1
God, 1
be, 1
praised,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
a, 1
real, 1
bed!", 1
"Ecco!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
guide,, 1
and, 1
pushing, 1
Danglars, 1
into, 1
the, 1
cell,, 1
he, 1
closed, 1
the, 1
door, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
A, 1
bolt, 1
grated, 1
and, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
a, 1
prisoner., 1
If, 1
there, 1
had, 1
been, 1
no, 1
bolt,, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
impossible, 1
for, 1
him, 1
to, 1
pass, 1
through, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
garrison, 1
who, 1
held, 1
the, 1
catacombs, 1
of, 1
St., 1
Sebastian,, 1
encamped, 1
round, 1
a, 1
master, 1
whom, 1
our, 1
readers, 1
must, 1
have, 1
recognized, 1
as, 1
the, 1
famous, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa., 1
Danglars,, 1
too,, 1
had, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
bandit,, 1
whose, 1
existence, 1
he, 1
would, 1
not, 1
believe, 1
when, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
mentioned, 1
him, 1
in, 1
Paris;, 1
and, 1
not, 1
only, 1
did, 1
he, 1
recognize, 1
him,, 1
but, 1
the, 1
cell, 1
in, 1
which, 1
Albert, 1
had, 1
been, 1
confined,, 1
and, 1
which, 1
was, 1
probably, 1
kept, 1
for, 1
the, 1
accommodation, 1
of, 1
strangers., 1
These, 1
recollections, 1
were, 1
dwelt, 1
upon, 1
with, 1
some, 1
pleasure, 1
by, 1
Danglars,, 1
and, 1
restored, 1
him, 1
to, 1
some, 1
degree, 1
of, 1
tranquillity., 1
Since, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
had, 1
not, 1
despatched, 1
him, 1
at, 1
once,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
that, 1
they, 1
would, 1
not, 1
kill, 1
him, 1
at, 1
all., 1
They, 1
had, 1
arrested, 1
him, 1
for, 1
the, 1
purpose, 1
of, 1
robbery,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
a, 1
few, 1
louis, 1
about, 1
him,, 1
he, 1
doubted, 1
not, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
ransomed., 1
He, 1
remembered, 1
that, 1
Morcerf, 1
had, 1
been, 1
taxed, 1
at, 1
4,000, 1
crowns,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
considered, 1
himself, 1
of, 1
much, 1
greater, 1
importance, 1
than, 1
Morcerf, 1
he, 1
fixed, 1
his, 1
own, 1
price, 1
at, 1
8,000, 1
crowns., 1
Eight, 1
thousand, 1
crowns, 1
amounted, 1
to, 1
48,000, 1
livres;, 1
he, 1
would, 1
then, 1
have, 1
about, 1
5,050,000, 1
francs, 1
left., 1
With, 1
this, 1
sum, 1
he, 1
could, 1
manage, 1
to, 1
keep, 1
out, 1
of, 1
difficulties., 1
Therefore,, 1
tolerably, 1
secure, 1
in, 1
being, 1
able, 1
to, 1
extricate, 1
himself, 1
from, 1
his, 1
position,, 1
provided, 1
he, 1
were, 1
not, 1
rated, 1
at, 1
the, 1
unreasonable, 1
sum, 1
of, 1
5,050,000, 1
francs,, 1
he, 1
stretched, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed,, 1
and, 1
after, 1
turning, 1
over, 1
two, 1
or, 1
three, 1
times,, 1
fell, 1
asleep, 1
with, 1
the, 1
tranquillity, 1
of, 1
the, 1
hero, 1
whose, 1
life, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
was, 1
studying., 1
Chapter, 1
115., 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa's, 1
Bill, 1
of, 1
Fare., 1
We, 1
awake, 1
from, 1
every, 1
sleep, 1
except, 1
the, 1
one, 1
dreaded, 1
by, 1
Danglars., 1
He, 1
awoke., 1
To, 1
a, 1
Parisian, 1
accustomed, 1
to, 1
silken, 1
curtains,, 1
walls, 1
hung, 1
with, 1
velvet, 1
drapery,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
soft, 1
perfume, 1
of, 1
burning, 1
wood,, 1
the, 1
white, 1
smoke, 1
of, 1
which, 1
diffuses, 1
itself, 1
in, 1
graceful, 1
curves, 1
around, 1
the, 1
room,, 1
the, 1
appearance, 1
of, 1
the, 1
whitewashed, 1
cell, 1
which, 1
greeted, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
awakening, 1
seemed, 1
like, 1
the, 1
continuation, 1
of, 1
some, 1
disagreeable, 1
dream., 1
But, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
situation, 1
a, 1
single, 1
moment, 1
suffices, 1
to, 1
change, 1
the, 1
strongest, 1
doubt, 1
into, 1
certainty., 1
"Yes,, 1
yes,", 1
he, 1
murmured,, 1
"I, 1
am, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brigands, 1
of, 1
whom, 1
Albert, 1
de, 1
Morcerf, 1
spoke.", 1
His, 1
first, 1
idea, 1
was, 1
to, 1
breathe,, 1
that, 1
he, 1
might, 1
know, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
was, 1
wounded., 1
He, 1
borrowed, 1
this, 1
from, 1
"Don, 1
Quixote,", 1
the, 1
only, 1
book, 1
he, 1
had, 1
ever, 1
read,, 1
but, 1
which, 1
he, 1
still, 1
slightly, 1
remembered., 1
"No,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"they, 1
have, 1
not, 1
wounded,, 1
but, 1
perhaps, 1
they, 1
have, 1
robbed, 1
me!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
thrust, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pockets., 1
They, 1
were, 1
untouched;, 1
the, 1
hundred, 1
louis, 1
he, 1
had, 1
reserved, 1
for, 1
his, 1
journey, 1
from, 1
Rome, 1
to, 1
Venice, 1
were, 1
in, 1
his, 1
trousers, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
that, 1
of, 1
his, 1
great-coat, 1
he, 1
found, 1
the, 1
little, 1
note-case, 1
containing, 1
his, 1
letter, 1
of, 1
credit, 1
for, 1
5,050,000, 1
francs., 1
"Singular, 1
bandits!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed;, 1
"they, 1
have, 1
left, 1
me, 1
my, 1
purse, 1
and, 1
pocket-book., 1
As, 1
I, 1
was, 1
saying, 1
last, 1
night,, 1
they, 1
intend, 1
me, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ransomed., 1
Hallo,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
my, 1
watch!, 1
Let, 1
me, 1
see, 1
what, 1
time, 1
it, 1
is.", 1
Danglars', 1
watch,, 1
one, 1
of, 1
Breguet's, 1
repeaters,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
had, 1
carefully, 1
wound, 1
up, 1
on, 1
the, 1
previous, 1
night,, 1
struck, 1
half, 1
past, 1
five., 1
Without, 1
this,, 1
Danglars, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
quite, 1
ignorant, 1
of, 1
the, 1
time,, 1
for, 1
daylight, 1
did, 1
not, 1
reach, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
Should, 1
he, 1
demand, 1
an, 1
explanation, 1
from, 1
the, 1
bandits,, 1
or, 1
should, 1
he, 1
wait, 1
patiently, 1
for, 1
them, 1
to, 1
propose, 1
it?, 1
The, 1
last, 1
alternative, 1
seemed, 1
the, 1
most, 1
prudent,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
waited, 1
until, 1
twelve, 1
o'clock., 1
During, 1
all, 1
this, 1
time, 1
a, 1
sentinel,, 1
who, 1
had, 1
been, 1
relieved, 1
at, 1
eight, 1
o'clock,, 1
had, 1
been, 1
watching, 1
his, 1
door., 1
Danglars, 1
suddenly, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
inclination, 1
to, 1
see, 1
the, 1
person, 1
who, 1
kept, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
him., 1
He, 1
had, 1
noticed, 1
that, 1
a, 1
few, 1
rays,, 1
not, 1
of, 1
daylight,, 1
but, 1
from, 1
a, 1
lamp,, 1
penetrated, 1
through, 1
the, 1
ill-joined, 1
planks, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
he, 1
approached, 1
just, 1
as, 1
the, 1
brigand, 1
was, 1
refreshing, 1
himself, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mouthful, 1
of, 1
brandy,, 1
which,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
leathern, 1
bottle, 1
containing, 1
it,, 1
sent, 1
forth, 1
an, 1
odor, 1
which, 1
was, 1
extremely, 1
unpleasant, 1
to, 1
Danglars., 1
"Faugh!", 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
retreating, 1
to, 1
the, 1
farther, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
At, 1
twelve, 1
this, 1
man, 1
was, 1
replaced, 1
by, 1
another, 1
functionary,, 1
and, 1
Danglars,, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
catch, 1
sight, 1
of, 1
his, 1
new, 1
guardian,, 1
approached, 1
the, 1
door, 1
again., 1
He, 1
was, 1
an, 1
athletic,, 1
gigantic, 1
bandit,, 1
with, 1
large, 1
eyes,, 1
thick, 1
lips,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
flat, 1
nose;, 1
his, 1
red, 1
hair, 1
fell, 1
in, 1
dishevelled, 1
masses, 1
like, 1
snakes, 1
around, 1
his, 1
shoulders., 1
"Ah,, 1
ha,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1
"this, 1
fellow, 1
is, 1
more, 1
like, 1
an, 1
ogre, 1
than, 1
anything, 1
else;, 1
however,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
rather, 1
too, 1
old, 1
and, 1
tough, 1
to, 1
be, 1
very, 1
good, 1
eating!", 1
We, 1
see, 1
that, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
collected, 1
enough, 1
to, 1
jest;, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
disprove, 1
the, 1
ogreish, 1
propensities,, 1
the, 1
man, 1
took, 1
some, 1
black, 1
bread,, 1
cheese,, 1
and, 1
onions, 1
from, 1
his, 1
wallet,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
began, 1
devouring, 1
voraciously., 1
"May, 1
I, 1
be, 1
hanged,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
glancing, 1
at, 1
the, 1
bandit's, 1
dinner, 1
through, 1
the, 1
crevices, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,--"may, 1
I, 1
be, 1
hanged, 1
if, 1
I, 1
can, 1
understand, 1
how, 1
people, 1
can, 1
eat, 1
such, 1
filth!", 1
and, 1
he, 1
withdrew, 1
to, 1
seat, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
goat-skin,, 1
which, 1
reminded, 1
him, 1
of, 1
the, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
the, 1
brandy., 1
But, 1
the, 1
mysteries, 1
of, 1
nature, 1
are, 1
incomprehensible,, 1
and, 1
there, 1
are, 1
certain, 1
invitations, 1
contained, 1
in, 1
even, 1
the, 1
coarsest, 1
food, 1
which, 1
appeal, 1
very, 1
irresistibly, 1
to, 1
a, 1
fasting, 1
stomach., 1
Danglars, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
own, 1
not, 1
to, 1
be, 1
very, 1
well, 1
supplied, 1
just, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
gradually, 1
the, 1
man, 1
appeared, 1
less, 1
ugly,, 1
the, 1
bread, 1
less, 1
black,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
cheese, 1
more, 1
fresh,, 1
while, 1
those, 1
dreadful, 1
vulgar, 1
onions, 1
recalled, 1
to, 1
his, 1
mind, 1
certain, 1
sauces, 1
and, 1
side-dishes,, 1
which, 1
his, 1
cook, 1
prepared, 1
in, 1
a, 1
very, 1
superior, 1
manner, 1
whenever, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Monsieur, 1
Deniseau,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
have, 1
a, 1
nice, 1
little, 1
fricassee, 1
to-day.", 1
He, 1
got, 1
up, 1
and, 1
knocked, 1
on, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head., 1
Danglars, 1
knew, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
heard,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
redoubled, 1
his, 1
blows., 1
"Che, 1
cosa?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
bandit., 1
"Come,, 1
come,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
tapping, 1
his, 1
fingers, 1
against, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
"I, 1
think, 1
it, 1
is, 1
quite, 1
time, 1
to, 1
think, 1
of, 1
giving, 1
me, 1
something, 1
to, 1
eat!", 1
But, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
understand, 1
him,, 1
or, 1
whether, 1
he, 1
had, 1
received, 1
no, 1
orders, 1
respecting, 1
the, 1
nourishment, 1
of, 1
Danglars,, 1
the, 1
giant,, 1
without, 1
answering,, 1
went, 1
on, 1
with, 1
his, 1
dinner., 1
Danglars', 1
feelings, 1
were, 1
hurt,, 1
and, 1
not, 1
wishing, 1
to, 1
put, 1
himself, 1
under, 1
obligations, 1
to, 1
the, 1
brute,, 1
the, 1
banker, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
down, 1
again, 1
on, 1
his, 1
goat-skin, 1
and, 1
did, 1
not, 1
breathe, 1
another, 1
word., 1
Four, 1
hours, 1
passed, 1
by, 1
and, 1
the, 1
giant, 1
was, 1
replaced, 1
by, 1
another, 1
bandit., 1
Danglars,, 1
who, 1
really, 1
began, 1
to, 1
experience, 1
sundry, 1
gnawings, 1
at, 1
the, 1
stomach,, 1
arose, 1
softly,, 1
again, 1
applied, 1
his, 1
eye, 1
to, 1
the, 1
crack, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
recognized, 1
the, 1
intelligent, 1
countenance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
guide., 1
It, 1
was,, 1
indeed,, 1
Peppino, 1
who, 1
was, 1
preparing, 1
to, 1
mount, 1
guard, 1
as, 1
comfortably, 1
as, 1
possible, 1
by, 1
seating, 1
himself, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
between, 1
his, 1
legs, 1
an, 1
earthen, 1
pan,, 1
containing, 1
chick-pease, 1
stewed, 1
with, 1
bacon., 1
Near, 1
the, 1
pan, 1
he, 1
also, 1
placed, 1
a, 1
pretty, 1
little, 1
basket, 1
of, 1
Villetri, 1
grapes, 1
and, 1
a, 1
flask, 1
of, 1
Orvieto., 1
Peppino, 1
was, 1
decidedly, 1
an, 1
epicure., 1
Danglars, 1
watched, 1
these, 1
preparations, 1
and, 1
his, 1
mouth, 1
watered., 1
"Come,", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
himself,, 1
"let, 1
me, 1
try, 1
if, 1
he, 1
will, 1
be, 1
more, 1
tractable, 1
than, 1
the, 1
other;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
tapped, 1
gently, 1
at, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"On, 1
y, 1
va,", 1
(coming), 1
exclaimed, 1
Peppino,, 1
who, 1
from, 1
frequenting, 1
the, 1
house, 1
of, 1
Signor, 1
Pastrini, 1
understood, 1
French, 1
perfectly, 1
in, 1
all, 1
its, 1
idioms., 1
Danglars, 1
immediately, 1
recognized, 1
him, 1
as, 1
the, 1
man, 1
who, 1
had, 1
called, 1
out, 1
in, 1
such, 1
a, 1
furious, 1
manner,, 1
"Put, 1
in, 1
your, 1
head!", 1
But, 1
this, 1
was, 1
not, 1
the, 1
time, 1
for, 1
recrimination,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
assumed, 1
his, 1
most, 1
agreeable, 1
manner, 1
and, 1
said, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gracious, 1
smile,--"Excuse, 1
me,, 1
sir,, 1
but, 1
are, 1
they, 1
not, 1
going, 1
to, 1
give, 1
me, 1
any, 1
dinner?", 1
"Does, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
happen, 1
to, 1
be, 1
hungry?", 1
"Happen, 1
to, 1
be, 1
hungry,--that's, 1
pretty, 1
good,, 1
when, 1
I, 1
haven't, 1
eaten, 1
for, 1
twenty-four, 1
hours!", 1
muttered, 1
Danglars., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
added, 1
aloud,, 1
"Yes,, 1
sir,, 1
I, 1
am, 1
hungry--very, 1
hungry.", 1
"What, 1
would, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
like?", 1
and, 1
Peppino, 1
placed, 1
his, 1
pan, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
the, 1
steam, 1
rose, 1
directly, 1
under, 1
the, 1
nostrils, 1
of, 1
Danglars., 1
"Give, 1
your, 1
orders.", 1
"Have, 1
you, 1
kitchens, 1
here?", 1
"Kitchens?--of, 1
course--complete, 1
ones.", 1
"And, 1
cooks?", 1
"Excellent!", 1
"Well,, 1
a, 1
fowl,, 1
fish,, 1
game,--it, 1
signifies, 1
little,, 1
so, 1
that, 1
I, 1
eat.", 1
"As, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
pleases., 1
You, 1
mentioned, 1
a, 1
fowl,, 1
I, 1
think?", 1
"Yes,, 1
a, 1
fowl.", 1
Peppino,, 1
turning, 1
around,, 1
shouted,, 1
"A, 1
fowl, 1
for, 1
his, 1
excellency!", 1
His, 1
voice, 1
yet, 1
echoed, 1
in, 1
the, 1
archway, 1
when, 1
a, 1
handsome,, 1
graceful,, 1
and, 1
half-naked, 1
young, 1
man, 1
appeared,, 1
bearing, 1
a, 1
fowl, 1
in, 1
a, 1
silver, 1
dish, 1
on, 1
his, 1
head,, 1
without, 1
the, 1
assistance, 1
of, 1
his, 1
hands., 1
"I, 1
could, 1
almost, 1
believe, 1
myself, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Cafe, 1
de, 1
Paris,", 1
murmured, 1
Danglars., 1
"Here,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
fowl, 1
from, 1
the, 1
young, 1
bandit, 1
and, 1
placing, 1
it, 1
on, 1
the, 1
worm-eaten, 1
table,, 1
which, 1
with, 1
the, 1
stool, 1
and, 1
the, 1
goat-skin, 1
bed, 1
formed, 1
the, 1
entire, 1
furniture, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cell., 1
Danglars, 1
asked, 1
for, 1
a, 1
knife, 1
and, 1
fork., 1
"Here,, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
offering, 1
him, 1
a, 1
little, 1
blunt, 1
knife, 1
and, 1
a, 1
boxwood, 1
fork., 1
Danglars, 1
took, 1
the, 1
knife, 1
in, 1
one, 1
hand, 1
and, 1
the, 1
fork, 1
in, 1
the, 1
other,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
about, 1
to, 1
cut, 1
up, 1
the, 1
fowl., 1
"Pardon, 1
me,, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
placing, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
on, 1
the, 1
banker's, 1
shoulder;, 1
"people, 1
pay, 1
here, 1
before, 1
they, 1
eat., 1
They, 1
might, 1
not, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1
and"--, 1
"Ah,, 1
ha,", 1
thought, 1
Danglars,, 1
"this, 1
is, 1
not, 1
so, 1
much, 1
like, 1
Paris,, 1
except, 1
that, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
probably, 1
be, 1
skinned!, 1
Never, 1
mind,, 1
I'll, 1
fix, 1
that, 1
all, 1
right., 1
I, 1
have, 1
always, 1
heard, 1
how, 1
cheap, 1
poultry, 1
is, 1
in, 1
Italy;, 1
I, 1
should, 1
think, 1
a, 1
fowl, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
about, 1
twelve, 1
sous, 1
at, 1
Rome.--There,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
throwing, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
down., 1
Peppino, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
the, 1
louis,, 1
and, 1
Danglars, 1
again, 1
prepared, 1
to, 1
carve, 1
the, 1
fowl., 1
"Stay, 1
a, 1
moment,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
rising;, 1
"you, 1
still, 1
owe, 1
me, 1
something.", 1
"I, 1
said, 1
they, 1
would, 1
skin, 1
me,", 1
thought, 1
Danglars;, 1
but, 1
resolving, 1
to, 1
resist, 1
the, 1
extortion,, 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"Come,, 1
how, 1
much, 1
do, 1
I, 1
owe, 1
you, 1
for, 1
this, 1
fowl?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
has, 1
given, 1
me, 1
a, 1
louis, 1
on, 1
account.", 1
"A, 1
louis, 1
on, 1
account, 1
for, 1
a, 1
fowl?", 1
"Certainly;, 1
and, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
now, 1
owes, 1
me, 1
4,999, 1
louis.", 1
Danglars, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
enormous, 1
eyes, 1
on, 1
hearing, 1
this, 1
gigantic, 1
joke., 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
very, 1
droll--very, 1
amusing--I, 1
allow;, 1
but,, 1
as, 1
I, 1
am, 1
very, 1
hungry,, 1
pray, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
eat., 1
Stay,, 1
here, 1
is, 1
another, 1
louis, 1
for, 1
you.", 1
"Then, 1
that, 1
will, 1
make, 1
only, 1
4,998, 1
louis, 1
more,", 1
said, 1
Peppino, 1
with, 1
the, 1
same, 1
indifference., 1
"I, 1
shall, 1
get, 1
them, 1
all, 1
in, 1
time.", 1
"Oh,, 1
as, 1
for, 1
that,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
angry, 1
at, 1
this, 1
prolongation, 1
of, 1
the, 1
jest,--"as, 1
for, 1
that, 1
you, 1
won't, 1
get, 1
them, 1
at, 1
all., 1
Go, 1
to, 1
the, 1
devil!, 1
You, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
with, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
have, 1
to, 1
deal!", 1
Peppino, 1
made, 1
a, 1
sign,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
youth, 1
hastily, 1
removed, 1
the, 1
fowl., 1
Danglars, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
goat-skin,, 1
and, 1
Peppino,, 1
reclosing, 1
the, 1
door,, 1
again, 1
began, 1
eating, 1
his, 1
pease, 1
and, 1
bacon., 1
Though, 1
Danglars, 1
could, 1
not, 1
see, 1
Peppino,, 1
the, 1
noise, 1
of, 1
his, 1
teeth, 1
allowed, 1
no, 1
doubt, 1
as, 1
to, 1
his, 1
occupation., 1
He, 1
was, 1
certainly, 1
eating,, 1
and, 1
noisily, 1
too,, 1
like, 1
an, 1
ill-bred, 1
man., 1
"Brute!", 1
said, 1
Danglars., 1
Peppino, 1
pretended, 1
not, 1
to, 1
hear, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
without, 1
even, 1
turning, 1
his, 1
head, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
slowly., 1
Danglars', 1
stomach, 1
felt, 1
so, 1
empty,, 1
that, 1
it, 1
seemed, 1
as, 1
if, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
impossible, 1
ever, 1
to, 1
fill, 1
it, 1
again;, 1
still, 1
he, 1
had, 1
patience, 1
for, 1
another, 1
half-hour,, 1
which, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
him, 1
like, 1
a, 1
century., 1
He, 1
again, 1
arose, 1
and, 1
went, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door., 1
"Come,, 1
sir,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
keep, 1
me, 1
starving, 1
here, 1
any, 1
longer,, 1
but, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
what, 1
they, 1
want.", 1
"Nay,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
you, 1
who, 1
should, 1
tell, 1
us, 1
what, 1
you, 1
want., 1
Give, 1
your, 1
orders,, 1
and, 1
we, 1
will, 1
execute, 1
them.", 1
"Then, 1
open, 1
the, 1
door, 1
directly.", 1
Peppino, 1
obeyed., 1
"Now, 1
look, 1
here,, 1
I, 1
want, 1
something, 1
to, 1
eat!, 1
To, 1
eat--do, 1
you, 1
hear?", 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
hungry?", 1
"Come,, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
me.", 1
"What, 1
would, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
like, 1
to, 1
eat?", 1
"A, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
dry, 1
bread,, 1
since, 1
the, 1
fowls, 1
are, 1
beyond, 1
all, 1
price, 1
in, 1
this, 1
accursed, 1
place.", 1
"Bread?, 1
Very, 1
well., 1
Hallo,, 1
there,, 1
some, 1
bread!", 1
he, 1
called., 1
The, 1
youth, 1
brought, 1
a, 1
small, 1
loaf., 1
"How, 1
much?", 1
asked, 1
Danglars., 1
"Four, 1
thousand, 1
nine, 1
hundred, 1
and, 1
ninety-eight, 1
louis,", 1
said, 1
Peppino;, 1
"You, 1
have, 1
paid, 1
two, 1
louis, 1
in, 1
advance.", 1
"What?, 1
One, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
a, 1
loaf?", 1
"One, 1
hundred, 1
thousand, 1
francs,", 1
repeated, 1
Peppino., 1
"But, 1
you, 1
only, 1
asked, 1
100,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
a, 1
fowl!", 1
"We, 1
have, 1
a, 1
fixed, 1
price, 1
for, 1
all, 1
our, 1
provisions., 1
It, 1
signifies, 1
nothing, 1
whether, 1
you, 1
eat, 1
much, 1
or, 1
little--whether, 1
you, 1
have, 1
ten, 1
dishes, 1
or, 1
one--it, 1
is, 1
always, 1
the, 1
same, 1
price.", 1
"What,, 1
still, 1
keeping, 1
up, 1
this, 1
silly, 1
jest?, 1
My, 1
dear, 1
fellow,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
perfectly, 1
ridiculous--stupid!, 1
You, 1
had, 1
better, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
at, 1
once, 1
that, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
starving, 1
me, 1
to, 1
death.", 1
"Oh,, 1
dear,, 1
no,, 1
your, 1
excellency,, 1
unless, 1
you, 1
intend, 1
to, 1
commit, 1
suicide., 1
Pay, 1
and, 1
eat.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
am, 1
I, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
with,, 1
brute?", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
enraged., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
suppose, 1
I, 1
carry, 1
100,000, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
my, 1
pocket?", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
has, 1
5,050,000, 1
francs, 1
in, 1
your, 1
pocket;, 1
that, 1
will, 1
be, 1
fifty, 1
fowls, 1
at, 1
100,000, 1
francs, 1
apiece,, 1
and, 1
half, 1
a, 1
fowl, 1
for, 1
the, 1
50,000.", 1
Danglars, 1
shuddered., 1
The, 1
bandage, 1
fell, 1
from, 1
his, 1
eyes,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
understood, 1
the, 1
joke,, 1
which, 1
he, 1
did, 1
not, 1
think, 1
quite, 1
so, 1
stupid, 1
as, 1
he, 1
had, 1
done, 1
just, 1
before., 1
"Come,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"if, 1
I, 1
pay, 1
you, 1
the, 1
100,000, 1
francs,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
be, 1
satisfied,, 1
and, 1
allow, 1
me, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
at, 1
my, 1
ease?", 1
"Certainly,", 1
said, 1
Peppino., 1
"But, 1
how, 1
can, 1
I, 1
pay, 1
them?", 1
"Oh,, 1
nothing, 1
easier;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
an, 1
account, 1
open, 1
with, 1
Messrs., 1
Thomson, 1
&, 1
French,, 1
Via, 1
dei, 1
Banchi,, 1
Rome;, 1
give, 1
me, 1
a, 1
draft, 1
for, 1
4,998, 1
louis, 1
on, 1
these, 1
gentlemen,, 1
and, 1
our, 1
banker, 1
shall, 1
take, 1
it.", 1
Danglars, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
as, 1
well, 1
to, 1
comply, 1
with, 1
a, 1
good, 1
grace,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
took, 1
the, 1
pen,, 1
ink,, 1
and, 1
paper, 1
Peppino, 1
offered, 1
him,, 1
wrote, 1
the, 1
draft,, 1
and, 1
signed, 1
it., 1
"Here,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"here, 1
is, 1
a, 1
draft, 1
at, 1
sight.", 1
"And, 1
here, 1
is, 1
your, 1
fowl.", 1
Danglars, 1
sighed, 1
while, 1
he, 1
carved, 1
the, 1
fowl;, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
very, 1
thin, 1
for, 1
the, 1
price, 1
it, 1
had, 1
cost., 1
As, 1
for, 1
Peppino,, 1
he, 1
examined, 1
the, 1
paper, 1
attentively,, 1
put, 1
it, 1
into, 1
his, 1
pocket,, 1
and, 1
continued, 1
eating, 1
his, 1
pease., 1
Chapter, 1
116., 1
The, 1
Pardon., 1
The, 1
next, 1
day, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
again, 1
hungry;, 1
certainly, 1
the, 1
air, 1
of, 1
that, 1
dungeon, 1
was, 1
very, 1
provocative, 1
of, 1
appetite., 1
The, 1
prisoner, 1
expected, 1
that, 1
he, 1
would, 1
be, 1
at, 1
no, 1
expense, 1
that, 1
day,, 1
for, 1
like, 1
an, 1
economical, 1
man, 1
he, 1
had, 1
concealed, 1
half, 1
of, 1
his, 1
fowl, 1
and, 1
a, 1
piece, 1
of, 1
the, 1
bread, 1
in, 1
the, 1
corner, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
But, 1
he, 1
had, 1
no, 1
sooner, 1
eaten, 1
than, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
thirsty;, 1
he, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
that., 1
He, 1
struggled, 1
against, 1
his, 1
thirst, 1
till, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
clave, 1
to, 1
the, 1
roof, 1
of, 1
his, 1
mouth;, 1
then,, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
able, 1
to, 1
resist,, 1
he, 1
called, 1
out., 1
The, 1
sentinel, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
door;, 1
it, 1
was, 1
a, 1
new, 1
face., 1
He, 1
thought, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
better, 1
to, 1
transact, 1
business, 1
with, 1
his, 1
old, 1
acquaintance,, 1
so, 1
he, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
Peppino., 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
Peppino,, 1
with, 1
an, 1
eagerness, 1
which, 1
Danglars, 1
thought, 1
favorable, 1
to, 1
him., 1
"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"Something, 1
to, 1
drink.", 1
"Your, 1
excellency, 1
knows, 1
that, 1
wine, 1
is, 1
beyond, 1
all, 1
price, 1
near, 1
Rome.", 1
"Then, 1
give, 1
me, 1
water,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1
endeavoring, 1
to, 1
parry, 1
the, 1
blow., 1
"Oh,, 1
water, 1
is, 1
even, 1
more, 1
scarce, 1
than, 1
wine,, 1
your, 1
excellency,--there, 1
has, 1
been, 1
such, 1
a, 1
drought.", 1
"Come,", 1
thought, 1
Danglars,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
the, 1
same, 1
old, 1
story.", 1
And, 1
while, 1
he, 1
smiled, 1
as, 1
he, 1
attempted, 1
to, 1
regard, 1
the, 1
affair, 1
as, 1
a, 1
joke,, 1
he, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
temples, 1
get, 1
moist, 1
with, 1
perspiration., 1
"Come,, 1
my, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
seeing, 1
that, 1
he, 1
made, 1
no, 1
impression, 1
on, 1
Peppino,, 1
"you, 1
will, 1
not, 1
refuse, 1
me, 1
a, 1
glass, 1
of, 1
wine?", 1
"I, 1
have, 1
already, 1
told, 1
you, 1
that, 1
we, 1
do, 1
not, 1
sell, 1
at, 1
retail.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
let, 1
me, 1
have, 1
a, 1
bottle, 1
of, 1
the, 1
least, 1
expensive.", 1
"They, 1
are, 1
all, 1
the, 1
same, 1
price.", 1
"And, 1
what, 1
is, 1
that?", 1
"Twenty-five, 1
thousand, 1
francs, 1
a, 1
bottle.", 1
"Tell, 1
me,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
tone, 1
whose, 1
bitterness, 1
Harpagon, 1
[*], 1
alone, 1
has, 1
been, 1
capable, 1
of, 1
revealing--"tell, 1
me, 1
that, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
despoil, 1
me, 1
of, 1
all;, 1
it, 1
will, 1
be, 1
sooner, 1
over, 1
than, 1
devouring, 1
me, 1
piecemeal.", 1
*, 1
The, 1
miser, 1
in, 1
Moliere's, 1
comedy, 1
of, 1
"L'Avare."--Ed., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
possible, 1
such, 1
may, 1
be, 1
the, 1
master's, 1
intention.", 1
"The, 1
master?--who, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"The, 1
person, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
were, 1
conducted, 1
yesterday.", 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
he?", 1
"Here.", 1
"Let, 1
me, 1
see, 1
him.", 1
"Certainly.", 1
And, 1
the, 1
next, 1
moment, 1
Luigi, 1
Vampa, 1
appeared, 1
before, 1
Danglars., 1
"You, 1
sent, 1
for, 1
me?", 1
he, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
prisoner., 1
"Are, 1
you,, 1
sir,, 1
the, 1
chief, 1
of, 1
the, 1
people, 1
who, 1
brought, 1
me, 1
here?", 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency., 1
What, 1
then?", 1
"How, 1
much, 1
do, 1
you, 1
require, 1
for, 1
my, 1
ransom?", 1
"Merely, 1
the, 1
5,000,000, 1
you, 1
have, 1
about, 1
you.", 1
Danglars, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
dreadful, 1
spasm, 1
dart, 1
through, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
"But, 1
this, 1
is, 1
all, 1
I, 1
have, 1
left, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"out, 1
of, 1
an, 1
immense, 1
fortune., 1
If, 1
you, 1
deprive, 1
me, 1
of, 1
that,, 1
take, 1
away, 1
my, 1
life, 1
also.", 1
"We, 1
are, 1
forbidden, 1
to, 1
shed, 1
your, 1
blood.", 1
"And, 1
by, 1
whom, 1
are, 1
you, 1
forbidden?", 1
"By, 1
him, 1
we, 1
obey.", 1
"You, 1
do,, 1
then,, 1
obey, 1
some, 1
one?", 1
"Yes,, 1
a, 1
chief.", 1
"I, 1
thought, 1
you, 1
said, 1
you, 1
were, 1
the, 1
chief?", 1
"So, 1
I, 1
am, 1
of, 1
these, 1
men;, 1
but, 1
there, 1
is, 1
another, 1
over, 1
me.", 1
"And, 1
did, 1
your, 1
superior, 1
order, 1
you, 1
to, 1
treat, 1
me, 1
in, 1
this, 1
way?", 1
"Yes.", 1
"But, 1
my, 1
purse, 1
will, 1
be, 1
exhausted.", 1
"Probably.", 1
"Come,", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
"will, 1
you, 1
take, 1
a, 1
million?", 1
"No.", 1
"Two, 1
millions?--three?--four?, 1
Come,, 1
four?, 1
I, 1
will, 1
give, 1
them, 1
to, 1
you, 1
on, 1
condition, 1
that, 1
you, 1
let, 1
me, 1
go.", 1
"Why, 1
do, 1
you, 1
offer, 1
me, 1
4,000,000, 1
for, 1
what, 1
is, 1
worth, 1
5,000,000?, 1
This, 1
is, 1
a, 1
kind, 1
of, 1
usury,, 1
banker,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
do, 1
not, 1

"Take, 1
all,, 1
then--take, 1
all,, 1
I, 1
tell, 1
you,, 1
and, 1
kill, 1
me!", 1
"Come,, 1
come,, 1
calm, 1
yourself., 1
You, 1
will, 1
excite, 1
your, 1
blood,, 1
and, 1
that, 1
would, 1
produce, 1
an, 1
appetite, 1
it, 1
would, 1
require, 1
a, 1
million, 1
a, 1
day, 1
to, 1
satisfy., 1
Be, 1
more, 1
economical.", 1
"But, 1
when, 1
I, 1
have, 1
no, 1
more, 1
money, 1
left, 1
to, 1
pay, 1
you?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
infuriated, 1
Danglars., 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
must, 1
suffer, 1
hunger.", 1
"Suffer, 1
hunger?", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
becoming, 1
pale., 1
"Most, 1
likely,", 1
replied, 1
Vampa, 1
coolly., 1
"But, 1
you, 1
say, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
kill, 1
me?", 1
"No.", 1
"And, 1
yet, 1
you, 1
will, 1
let, 1
me, 1
perish, 1
with, 1
hunger?", 1
"Ah,, 1
that, 1
is, 1
a, 1
different, 1
thing.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
wretches,", 1
cried, 1
Danglars,, 1
"I, 1
will, 1
defy, 1
your, 1
infamous, 1
calculations--I, 1
would, 1
rather, 1
die, 1
at, 1
once!, 1
You, 1
may, 1
torture,, 1
torment,, 1
kill, 1
me,, 1
but, 1
you, 1
shall, 1
not, 1
have, 1
my, 1
signature, 1
again!", 1
"As, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
pleases,", 1
said, 1
Vampa,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
left, 1
the, 1
cell., 1
Danglars,, 1
raving,, 1
threw, 1
himself, 1
on, 1
the, 1
goat-skin., 1
Who, 1
could, 1
these, 1
men, 1
be?, 1
Who, 1
was, 1
the, 1
invisible, 1
chief?, 1
What, 1
could, 1
be, 1
his, 1
intentions, 1
towards, 1
him?, 1
And, 1
why,, 1
when, 1
every, 1
one, 1
else, 1
was, 1
allowed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
ransomed,, 1
might, 1
he, 1
not, 1
also, 1
be?, 1
Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
certainly, 1
a, 1
speedy,, 1
violent, 1
death, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
fine, 1
means, 1
of, 1
deceiving, 1
these, 1
remorseless, 1
enemies,, 1
who, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
pursue, 1
him, 1
with, 1
such, 1
incomprehensible, 1
vengeance., 1
But, 1
to, 1
die?, 1
For, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
in, 1
his, 1
life,, 1
Danglars, 1
contemplated, 1
death, 1
with, 1
a, 1
mixture, 1
of, 1
dread, 1
and, 1
desire;, 1
the, 1
time, 1
had, 1
come, 1
when, 1
the, 1
implacable, 1
spectre,, 1
which, 1
exists, 1
in, 1
the, 1
mind, 1
of, 1
every, 1
human, 1
creature,, 1
arrested, 1
his, 1
attention, 1
and, 1
called, 1
out, 1
with, 1
every, 1
pulsation, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
"Thou, 1
shalt, 1
die!", 1
Danglars, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
timid, 1
animal, 1
excited, 1
in, 1
the, 1
chase;, 1
first, 1
it, 1
flies,, 1
then, 1
despairs,, 1
and, 1
at, 1
last,, 1
by, 1
the, 1
very, 1
force, 1
of, 1
desperation,, 1
sometimes, 1
succeeds, 1
in, 1
eluding, 1
its, 1
pursuers., 1
Danglars, 1
meditated, 1
an, 1
escape;, 1
but, 1
the, 1
walls, 1
were, 1
solid, 1
rock,, 1
a, 1
man, 1
was, 1
sitting, 1
reading, 1
at, 1
the, 1
only, 1
outlet, 1
to, 1
the, 1
cell,, 1
and, 1
behind, 1
that, 1
man, 1
shapes, 1
armed, 1
with, 1
guns, 1
continually, 1
passed., 1
His, 1
resolution, 1
not, 1
to, 1
sign, 1
lasted, 1
two, 1
days,, 1
after, 1
which, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
a, 1
million, 1
for, 1
some, 1
food., 1
They, 1
sent, 1
him, 1
a, 1
magnificent, 1
supper,, 1
and, 1
took, 1
his, 1
million., 1
From, 1
this, 1
time, 1
the, 1
prisoner, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
suffer, 1
no, 1
longer,, 1
but, 1
to, 1
have, 1
everything, 1
he, 1
wanted., 1
At, 1
the, 1
end, 1
of, 1
twelve, 1
days,, 1
after, 1
having, 1
made, 1
a, 1
splendid, 1
dinner,, 1
he, 1
reckoned, 1
his, 1
accounts,, 1
and, 1
found, 1
that, 1
he, 1
had, 1
only, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
left., 1
Then, 1
a, 1
strange, 1
reaction, 1
took, 1
place;, 1
he, 1
who, 1
had, 1
just, 1
abandoned, 1
5,000,000, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
save, 1
the, 1
50,000, 1
francs, 1
he, 1
had, 1
left,, 1
and, 1
sooner, 1
than, 1
give, 1
them, 1
up, 1
he, 1
resolved, 1
to, 1
enter, 1
again, 1
upon, 1
a, 1
life, 1
of, 1
privation--he, 1
was, 1
deluded, 1
by, 1
the, 1
hopefulness, 1
that, 1
is, 1
a, 1
premonition, 1
of, 1
madness., 1
He, 1
who, 1
for, 1
so, 1
long, 1
a, 1
time, 1
had, 1
forgotten, 1
God,, 1
began, 1
to, 1
think, 1
that, 1
miracles, 1
were, 1
possible--that, 1
the, 1
accursed, 1
cavern, 1
might, 1
be, 1
discovered, 1
by, 1
the, 1
officers, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Papal, 1
States,, 1
who, 1
would, 1
release, 1
him;, 1
that, 1
then, 1
he, 1
would, 1
have, 1
50,000, 1
remaining,, 1
which, 1
would, 1
be, 1
sufficient, 1
to, 1
save, 1
him, 1
from, 1
starvation;, 1
and, 1
finally, 1
he, 1
prayed, 1
that, 1
this, 1
sum, 1
might, 1
be, 1
preserved, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
he, 1
prayed, 1
he, 1
wept., 1
Three, 1
days, 1
passed, 1
thus,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
his, 1
prayers, 1
were, 1
frequent,, 1
if, 1
not, 1
heartfelt., 1
Sometimes, 1
he, 1
was, 1
delirious,, 1
and, 1
fancied, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
an, 1
old, 1
man, 1
stretched, 1
on, 1
a, 1
pallet;, 1
he,, 1
also,, 1
was, 1
dying, 1
of, 1
hunger., 1
On, 1
the, 1
fourth,, 1
he, 1
was, 1
no, 1
longer, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
but, 1
a, 1
living, 1
corpse., 1
He, 1
had, 1
picked, 1
up, 1
every, 1
crumb, 1
that, 1
had, 1
been, 1
left, 1
from, 1
his, 1
former, 1
meals,, 1
and, 1
was, 1
beginning, 1
to, 1
eat, 1
the, 1
matting, 1
which, 1
covered, 1
the, 1
floor, 1
of, 1
his, 1
cell., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
entreated, 1
Peppino,, 1
as, 1
he, 1
would, 1
a, 1
guardian, 1
angel,, 1
to, 1
give, 1
him, 1
food;, 1
he, 1
offered, 1
him, 1
1,000, 1
francs, 1
for, 1
a, 1
mouthful, 1
of, 1
bread., 1
But, 1
Peppino, 1
did, 1
not, 1
answer., 1
On, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1
day, 1
he, 1
dragged, 1
himself, 1
to, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
cell., 1
"Are, 1
you, 1
not, 1
a, 1
Christian?", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
falling, 1
on, 1
his, 1
knees., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
assassinate, 1
a, 1
man, 1
who,, 1
in, 1
the, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
heaven,, 1
is, 1
a, 1
brother?, 1
Oh,, 1
my, 1
former, 1
friends,, 1
my, 1
former, 1
friends!", 1
he, 1
murmured,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
with, 1
his, 1
face, 1
to, 1
the, 1
ground., 1
Then, 1
rising, 1
in, 1
despair,, 1
he, 1
exclaimed,, 1
"The, 1
chief,, 1
the, 1
chief!", 1
"Here, 1
I, 1
am,", 1
said, 1
Vampa,, 1
instantly, 1
appearing;, 1
"what, 1
do, 1
you, 1
want?", 1
"Take, 1
my, 1
last, 1
gold,", 1
muttered, 1
Danglars,, 1
holding, 1
out, 1
his, 1
pocket-book,, 1
"and, 1
let, 1
me, 1
live, 1
here;, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
no, 1
more, 1
for, 1
liberty--I, 1
only, 1
ask, 1
to, 1
live!", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
suffer, 1
a, 1
great, 1
deal?", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,, 1
cruelly!", 1
"Still,, 1
there, 1
have, 1
been, 1
men, 1
who, 1
suffered, 1
more, 1
than, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
do, 1
not, 1
think, 1
so.", 1
"Yes;, 1
those, 1
who, 1
have, 1
died, 1
of, 1
hunger.", 1
Danglars, 1
thought, 1
of, 1
the, 1
old, 1
man, 1
whom,, 1
in, 1
his, 1
hours, 1
of, 1
delirium,, 1
he, 1
had, 1
seen, 1
groaning, 1
on, 1
his, 1
bed., 1
He, 1
struck, 1
his, 1
forehead, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
and, 1
groaned., 1
"Yes,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"there, 1
have, 1
been, 1
some, 1
who, 1
have, 1
suffered, 1
more, 1
than, 1
I, 1
have,, 1
but, 1
then, 1
they, 1
must, 1
have, 1
been, 1
martyrs, 1
at, 1
least.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
repent?", 1
asked, 1
a, 1
deep,, 1
solemn, 1
voice,, 1
which, 1
caused, 1
Danglars', 1
hair, 1
to, 1
stand, 1
on, 1
end., 1
His, 1
feeble, 1
eyes, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
distinguish, 1
objects,, 1
and, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
bandit, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
man, 1
enveloped, 1
in, 1
a, 1
cloak,, 1
half, 1
lost, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow, 1
of, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
column., 1
"Of, 1
what, 1
must, 1
I, 1
repent?", 1
stammered, 1
Danglars., 1
"Of, 1
the, 1
evil, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
voice., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes;, 1
oh,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
do, 1
indeed, 1
repent.", 1
And, 1
he, 1
struck, 1
his, 1
breast, 1
with, 1
his, 1
emaciated, 1
fist., 1
"Then, 1
I, 1
forgive, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
man,, 1
dropping, 1
his, 1
cloak,, 1
and, 1
advancing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
light., 1
"The, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo!", 1
said, 1
Danglars,, 1
more, 1
pale, 1
from, 1
terror, 1
than, 1
he, 1
had, 1
been, 1
just, 1
before, 1
from, 1
hunger, 1
and, 1
misery., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
mistaken--I, 1
am, 1
not, 1
the, 1
Count, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo.", 1
"Then, 1
who, 1
are, 1
you?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
he, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
sold, 1
and, 1
dishonored--I, 1
am, 1
he, 1
whose, 1
betrothed, 1
you, 1
prostituted--I, 1
am, 1
he, 1
upon, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
trampled, 1
that, 1
you, 1
might, 1
raise, 1
yourself, 1
to, 1
fortune--I, 1
am, 1
he, 1
whose, 1
father, 1
you, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
die, 1
of, 1
hunger--I, 1
am, 1
he, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
also, 1
condemned, 1
to, 1
starvation,, 1
and, 1
who, 1
yet, 1
forgives, 1
you,, 1
because, 1
he, 1
hopes, 1
to, 1
be, 1
forgiven--I, 1
am, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes!", 1
Danglars, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
cry,, 1
and, 1
fell, 1
prostrate., 1
"Rise,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"your, 1
life, 1
is, 1
safe;, 1
the, 1
same, 1
good, 1
fortune, 1
has, 1
not, 1
happened, 1
to, 1
your, 1
accomplices--one, 1

mad,, 1
the, 1

50,000, 1
francs, 1

you., 1

now, 1
eat, 1
and, 1
drink;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
entertain, 1
you, 1
to-night., 1

this, 1
man, 1
is, 1
satisfied,, 1
let, 1
him, 1
be, 1
free.", 1
Danglars, 1
remained, 1
prostrate, 1
while, 1
the, 1
count, 1
withdrew;, 1
when, 1
he, 1
raised, 1
his, 1
head, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
disappearing, 1
down, 1
the, 1
passage, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
a, 1
shadow,, 1
before, 1
which, 1
the, 1
bandits, 1
bowed., 1
According, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
directions,, 1
Danglars, 1
was, 1
waited, 1
on, 1
by, 1
Vampa,, 1
who, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
the, 1
best, 1
wine, 1
and, 1
fruits, 1
of, 1
Italy;, 1
then,, 1
having, 1
conducted, 1
him, 1
to, 1
the, 1
road,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
to, 1
the, 1
post-chaise,, 1
left, 1
him, 1
leaning, 1
against, 1
a, 1
tree., 1
He, 1
remained, 1
there, 1
all, 1
night,, 1
not, 1
knowing, 1
where, 1
he, 1
was., 1
When, 1
daylight, 1
dawned, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
near, 1
a, 1
stream;, 1
he, 1
was, 1
thirsty,, 1
and, 1
dragged, 1
himself, 1
towards, 1
it., 1
As, 1
he, 1
stooped, 1
down, 1
to, 1
drink,, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
that, 1
his, 1
hair, 1
had, 1
become, 1
entirely, 1
white., 1
Chapter, 1
117., 1
The, 1
Fifth, 1
of, 1
October., 1
It, 1
was, 1
about, 1
six, 1
o'clock, 1
in, 1
the, 1
evening;, 1
an, 1
opal-colored, 1
light,, 1
through, 1
which, 1
an, 1
autumnal, 1
sun, 1
shed, 1
its, 1
golden, 1
rays,, 1
descended, 1
on, 1
the, 1
blue, 1
ocean., 1
The, 1
heat, 1
of, 1
the, 1
day, 1
had, 1
gradually, 1
decreased,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
light, 1
breeze, 1
arose,, 1
seeming, 1
like, 1
the, 1
respiration, 1
of, 1
nature, 1
on, 1
awakening, 1
from, 1
the, 1
burning, 1
siesta, 1
of, 1
the, 1
south., 1
A, 1
delicious, 1
zephyr, 1
played, 1
along, 1
the, 1
coasts, 1
of, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean,, 1
and, 1
wafted, 1
from, 1
shore, 1
to, 1
shore, 1
the, 1
sweet, 1
perfume, 1
of, 1
plants,, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1
the, 1
fresh, 1
smell, 1
of, 1
the, 1
sea., 1
A, 1
light, 1
yacht,, 1
chaste, 1
and, 1
elegant, 1
in, 1
its, 1
form,, 1
was, 1
gliding, 1
amidst, 1
the, 1
first, 1
dews, 1
of, 1
night, 1
over, 1
the, 1
immense, 1
lake,, 1
extending, 1
from, 1
Gibraltar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Dardanelles,, 1
and, 1
from, 1
Tunis, 1
to, 1
Venice., 1
The, 1
vessel, 1
resembled, 1
a, 1
swan, 1
with, 1
its, 1
wings, 1
opened, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
wind,, 1
gliding, 1
on, 1
the, 1
water., 1
It, 1
advanced, 1
swiftly, 1
and, 1
gracefully,, 1
leaving, 1
behind, 1
it, 1
a, 1
glittering, 1
stretch, 1
of, 1
foam., 1
By, 1
degrees, 1
the, 1
sun, 1
disappeared, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
western, 1
horizon;, 1
but, 1
as, 1
though, 1
to, 1
prove, 1
the, 1
truth, 1
of, 1
the, 1
fanciful, 1
ideas, 1
in, 1
heathen, 1
mythology,, 1
its, 1
indiscreet, 1
rays, 1
reappeared, 1
on, 1
the, 1
summit, 1
of, 1
every, 1
wave,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
the, 1
god, 1
of, 1
fire, 1
had, 1
just, 1
sunk, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
bosom, 1
of, 1
Amphitrite,, 1
who, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
hide, 1
her, 1
lover, 1
beneath, 1
her, 1
azure, 1
mantle., 1
The, 1
yacht, 1
moved, 1
rapidly, 1
on,, 1
though, 1
there, 1
did, 1
not, 1
appear, 1
to, 1
be, 1
sufficient, 1
wind, 1
to, 1
ruffle, 1
the, 1
curls, 1
on, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
a, 1
young, 1
girl., 1
Standing, 1
on, 1
the, 1
prow, 1
was, 1
a, 1
tall, 1
man,, 1
of, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
complexion,, 1
who, 1
saw, 1
with, 1
dilating, 1
eyes, 1
that, 1
they, 1
were, 1
approaching, 1
a, 1
dark, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
land, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shape, 1
of, 1
a, 1
cone,, 1
which, 1
rose, 1
from, 1
the, 1
midst, 1
of, 1
the, 1
waves, 1
like, 1
the, 1
hat, 1
of, 1
a, 1
Catalan., 1
"Is, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
traveller,, 1
to, 1
whose, 1
orders, 1
the, 1
yacht, 1
was, 1
for, 1
the, 1
time, 1
submitted,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
melancholy, 1
voice., 1
"Yes,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"we, 1
have, 1
reached, 1
it.", 1
"We, 1
have, 1
reached, 1
it!", 1
repeated, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
in, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
indescribable, 1
sadness., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
tone,, 1
"Yes;, 1
that, 1
is, 1
the, 1
haven.", 1
And, 1
then, 1
he, 1
again, 1
plunged, 1
into, 1
a, 1
train, 1
of, 1
thought,, 1
the, 1
character, 1
of, 1
which, 1
was, 1
better, 1
revealed, 1
by, 1
a, 1
sad, 1
smile,, 1
than, 1
it, 1
would, 1
have, 1
been, 1
by, 1
tears., 1
A, 1
few, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards, 1
a, 1
flash, 1
of, 1
light,, 1
which, 1
was, 1
extinguished, 1
instantly,, 1
was, 1
seen, 1
on, 1
the, 1
land,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
firearms, 1
reached, 1
the, 1
yacht., 1
"Your, 1
excellency,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
captain,, 1
"that, 1
was, 1
the, 1
land, 1
signal,, 1
will, 1
you, 1
answer, 1
yourself?", 1
"What, 1
signal?", 1
The, 1
captain, 1
pointed, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
island,, 1
up, 1
the, 1
side, 1
of, 1
which, 1
ascended, 1
a, 1
volume, 1
of, 1
smoke,, 1
increasing, 1
as, 1
it, 1
rose., 1
"Ah,, 1
yes,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
as, 1
if, 1
awaking, 1
from, 1
a, 1
dream., 1
"Give, 1
it, 1
to, 1
me.", 1
The, 1
captain, 1
gave, 1
him, 1
a, 1
loaded, 1
carbine;, 1
the, 1
traveller, 1
slowly, 1
raised, 1
it,, 1
and, 1
fired, 1
in, 1
the, 1
air., 1
Ten, 1
minutes, 1
afterwards,, 1
the, 1
sails, 1
were, 1
furled,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
cast, 1
anchor, 1
about, 1
a, 1
hundred, 1
fathoms, 1
from, 1
the, 1
little, 1
harbor., 1
The, 1
gig, 1
was, 1
already, 1
lowered,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
it, 1
were, 1
four, 1
oarsmen, 1
and, 1
a, 1
coxswain., 1
The, 1
traveller, 1
descended,, 1
and, 1
instead, 1
of, 1
sitting, 1
down, 1
at, 1
the, 1
stern, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
which, 1
had, 1
been, 1
decorated, 1
with, 1
a, 1
blue, 1
carpet, 1
for, 1
his, 1
accommodation,, 1
stood, 1
up, 1
with, 1
his, 1
arms, 1
crossed., 1
The, 1
rowers, 1
waited,, 1
their, 1
oars, 1
half, 1
lifted, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
water,, 1
like, 1
birds, 1
drying, 1
their, 1
wings., 1
"Give, 1
way,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
traveller., 1
The, 1
eight, 1
oars, 1
fell, 1
into, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
simultaneously, 1
without, 1
splashing, 1
a, 1
drop, 1
of, 1
water,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
boat,, 1
yielding, 1
to, 1
the, 1
impulsion,, 1
glided, 1
forward., 1
In, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
they, 1
found, 1
themselves, 1
in, 1
a, 1
little, 1
harbor,, 1
formed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
natural, 1
creek;, 1
the, 1
boat, 1
grounded, 1
on, 1
the, 1
fine, 1
sand., 1
"Will, 1
your, 1
excellency, 1
be, 1
so, 1
good, 1
as, 1
to, 1
mount, 1
the, 1
shoulders, 1
of, 1
two, 1
of, 1
our, 1
men,, 1
they, 1
will, 1
carry, 1
you, 1
ashore?", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
answered, 1
this, 1
invitation, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gesture, 1
of, 1
indifference,, 1
and, 1
stepped, 1
out, 1
of, 1
the, 1
boat;, 1
the, 1
sea, 1
immediately, 1
rose, 1
to, 1
his, 1
waist., 1
"Ah,, 1
your, 1
excellency,", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
pilot,, 1
"you, 1
should, 1
not, 1
have, 1
done, 1
so;, 1
our, 1
master, 1
will, 1
scold, 1
us, 1
for, 1
it.", 1
The, 1
young, 1
man, 1
continued, 1
to, 1
advance,, 1
following, 1
the, 1
sailors,, 1
who, 1
chose, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
footing., 1
Thirty, 1
strides, 1
brought, 1
them, 1
to, 1
dry, 1
land;, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
stamped, 1
on, 1
the, 1
ground, 1
to, 1
shake, 1
off, 1
the, 1
wet,, 1
and, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
for, 1
some, 1
one, 1
to, 1
show, 1
him, 1
his, 1
road,, 1
for, 1
it, 1
was, 1
quite, 1
dark., 1
Just, 1
as, 1
he, 1
turned,, 1
a, 1
hand, 1
rested, 1
on, 1
his, 1
shoulder,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
made, 1
him, 1
shudder, 1
exclaimed,--"Good-evening,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
you, 1
are, 1
punctual,, 1
thank, 1
you!", 1
"Ah,, 1
is, 1
it, 1
you,, 1
count?", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
almost, 1
joyful, 1
accent,, 1
pressing, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo's, 1
hand, 1
with, 1
both, 1
his, 1
own., 1
"Yes;, 1
you, 1
see, 1
I, 1
am, 1
as, 1
exact, 1
as, 1
you, 1
are., 1
But, 1
you, 1
are, 1
dripping,, 1
my, 1
dear, 1
fellow;, 1
you, 1
must, 1
change, 1
your, 1
clothes,, 1
as, 1
Calypso, 1
said, 1
to, 1
Telemachus., 1
Come,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
habitation, 1
prepared, 1
for, 1
you, 1
in, 1
which, 1
you, 1
will, 1
soon, 1
forget, 1
fatigue, 1
and, 1
cold.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
perceived, 1
that, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man, 1
had, 1
turned, 1
around;, 1
indeed,, 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1
with, 1
surprise, 1
that, 1
the, 1
men, 1
who, 1
had, 1
brought, 1
him, 1
had, 1
left, 1
without, 1
being, 1
paid,, 1
or, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
word., 1
Already, 1
the, 1
sound, 1
of, 1
their, 1
oars, 1
might, 1
be, 1
heard, 1
as, 1
they, 1
returned, 1
to, 1
the, 1
yacht., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
looking, 1
for, 1
the, 1
sailors.", 1
"Yes,, 1
I, 1
paid, 1
them, 1
nothing,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
they, 1
are, 1
gone.", 1
"Never, 1
mind, 1
that,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
smiling., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
an, 1
agreement, 1
with, 1
the, 1
navy,, 1
that, 1
the, 1
access, 1
to, 1
my, 1
island, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
free, 1
of, 1
all, 1
charge., 1
I, 1
have, 1
made, 1
a, 1
bargain.", 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
surprise., 1
"Count,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
the, 1
same, 1
here, 1
as, 1
in, 1
Paris.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"Here, 1
you, 1
laugh.", 1
The, 1
count's, 1
brow, 1
became, 1
clouded., 1
"You, 1
are, 1
right, 1
to, 1
recall, 1
me, 1
to, 1
myself,, 1
Maximilian,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"I, 1
was, 1
delighted, 1
to, 1
see, 1
you, 1
again,, 1
and, 1
forgot, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
that, 1
all, 1
happiness, 1
is, 1
fleeting.", 1
"Oh,, 1
no,, 1
no,, 1
count,", 1
cried, 1
Maximilian,, 1
seizing, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hands,, 1
"pray, 1
laugh;, 1
be, 1
happy,, 1
and, 1
prove, 1
to, 1
me,, 1
by, 1
your, 1
indifference,, 1
that, 1
life, 1
is, 1
endurable, 1
to, 1
sufferers., 1
Oh,, 1
how, 1
charitable,, 1
kind,, 1
and, 1
good, 1
you, 1
are;, 1
you, 1
affect, 1
this, 1
gayety, 1
to, 1
inspire, 1
me, 1
with, 1
courage.", 1
"You, 1
are, 1
wrong,, 1
Morrel;, 1
I, 1
was, 1
really, 1
happy.", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
forget, 1
me,, 1
so, 1
much, 1
the, 1
better.", 1
"How, 1
so?", 1
"Yes;, 1
for, 1
as, 1
the, 1
gladiator, 1
said, 1
to, 1
the, 1
emperor,, 1
when, 1
he, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
arena,, 1
'He, 1
who, 1
is, 1
about, 1
to, 1
die, 1
salutes, 1
you.'", 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
are, 1
not, 1
consoled?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
surprised., 1
"Oh,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel,, 1
with, 1
a, 1
glance, 1
full, 1
of, 1
bitter, 1
reproach,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
think, 1
it, 1
possible, 1
that, 1
I, 1
could, 1
be?", 1
"Listen,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
understand, 1
the, 1
meaning, 1
of, 1
my, 1
words?, 1
You, 1
cannot, 1
take, 1
me, 1
for, 1
a, 1
commonplace, 1
man,, 1
a, 1
mere, 1
rattle,, 1
emitting, 1
a, 1
vague, 1
and, 1
senseless, 1
noise., 1
When, 1
I, 1
ask, 1
you, 1
if, 1
you, 1
are, 1
consoled,, 1
I, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
you, 1
as, 1
a, 1
man, 1
for, 1
whom, 1
the, 1
human, 1
heart, 1
has, 1
no, 1
secrets., 1
Well,, 1
Morrel,, 1
let, 1
us, 1
both, 1
examine, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
your, 1
heart., 1
Do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
feel, 1
the, 1
same, 1
feverish, 1
impatience, 1
of, 1
grief, 1
which, 1
made, 1
you, 1
start, 1
like, 1
a, 1
wounded, 1
lion?, 1
Have, 1
you, 1
still, 1
that, 1
devouring, 1
thirst, 1
which, 1
can, 1
only, 1
be, 1
appeased, 1
in, 1
the, 1
grave?, 1
Are, 1
you, 1
still, 1
actuated, 1
by, 1
the, 1
regret, 1
which, 1
drags, 1
the, 1
living, 1
to, 1
the, 1
pursuit, 1
of, 1
death;, 1
or, 1
are, 1
you, 1
only, 1
suffering, 1
from, 1
the, 1
prostration, 1
of, 1
fatigue, 1
and, 1
the, 1
weariness, 1
of, 1
hope, 1
deferred?, 1

the, 1
loss, 1
of, 1

the, 1
case,--if, 1
you, 1

Maximilian,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
consoled--do, 1
not, 1
complain.", 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
in, 1
a, 1
firm, 1
and, 1
at, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
soft, 1
voice,, 1
"listen, 1

her, 1

Emmanuel;, 1

I, 1
require, 1
a, 1
strong, 1
mind, 1
to, 1
smile, 1
on, 1
my, 1
last, 1

My, 1

would, 1
be, 1
bathed, 1
in, 1
tears, 1

fainting;, 1

could, 1
not, 1
bear, 1
to, 1
see, 1
her, 1

Emmanuel, 1
would, 1
tear, 1
the, 1
weapon, 1
from, 1
my, 1

alarm, 1

are, 1
more, 1
than, 1

sure,, 1
lead, 1
me, 1
to, 1
death, 1

pleasant, 1
path,, 1

you, 1
not?", 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
still, 1
one, 1
doubt,--are, 1
you, 1

enough, 1
to, 1
pride, 1
yourself, 1
upon, 1
your, 1

"No,, 1
indeed,--I, 1
am, 1
calm,", 1

Morrel,, 1
giving, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
to, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"my, 1
pulse, 1
does, 1

faster, 1

know, 1
what, 1
you, 1

waited, 1
a, 1
month,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
I, 1
suffered, 1
for, 1
a, 1
month!, 1
I, 1
did, 1
hope, 1
(man, 1
is, 1
a, 1
poor, 1
wretched, 1
creature),, 1
I, 1
did, 1
hope., 1
What, 1
I, 1
cannot, 1
tell,--something, 1
wonderful,, 1
an, 1
absurdity,, 1
a, 1
miracle,--of, 1

alone, 1
can, 1
tell, 1

has, 1
mingled, 1
with, 1

reason, 1
that, 1
folly, 1
we, 1
call, 1

Yes,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
wait--yes,, 1
I, 1
did, 1
hope,, 1
count,, 1

during, 1
this, 1
quarter, 1
of, 1
an, 1
hour, 1
we, 1
have, 1
been, 1
talking, 1
together,, 1

have, 1
unconsciously, 1
wounded,, 1
tortured, 1
my, 1
heart,, 1
for, 1
every, 1
word, 1

have, 1
uttered, 1
proved, 1
that, 1

was, 1
no, 1

for, 1
me., 1
Oh,, 1

I, 1
shall, 1
sleep, 1
calmly,, 1
deliciously, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
death.", 1
Morrel, 1
uttered, 1
these, 1
words, 1
with, 1
an, 1
energy, 1
which, 1
made, 1
the, 1
count, 1
shudder., 1
"My, 1
friend,", 1
continued, 1
Morrel,, 1
"you, 1
named, 1
the, 1

of, 1
the, 1
period, 1
of, 1
waiting,--to-day, 1
is, 1
the, 1
fifth, 1

he, 1
took, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
"it, 1
is, 1
now, 1
nine, 1
o'clock,--I, 1
have, 1
yet, 1
three, 1
hours, 1
to, 1

"Be, 1
it, 1
so,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"come.", 1
Morrel, 1
mechanically, 1
followed, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
and, 1
they, 1
had, 1
entered, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
before, 1
he, 1
perceived, 1
it., 1
He, 1
felt, 1
a, 1
carpet, 1
under, 1
his, 1
feet,, 1
a, 1
door, 1
opened,, 1
perfumes, 1
surrounded, 1
him,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
brilliant, 1
light, 1
dazzled, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
Morrel, 1
hesitated, 1
to, 1
advance;, 1
he, 1
dreaded, 1
the, 1
enervating, 1
effect, 1
of, 1
all, 1
that, 1
he, 1
saw., 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
drew, 1
him, 1
in, 1
gently., 1
"Why, 1
should, 1
we, 1
not, 1
spend, 1
the, 1
last, 1
three, 1
hours, 1
remaining, 1
to, 1
us, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
like, 1
those, 1
ancient, 1
Romans,, 1
who, 1
when, 1
condemned, 1
by, 1
Nero,, 1
their, 1
emperor, 1

heir,, 1
sat, 1
down, 1
at, 1
a, 1
table, 1
covered, 1
with, 1
flowers,, 1
and, 1
gently, 1
glided, 1
into, 1
death,, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
perfume, 1
of, 1
heliotropes, 1
and, 1
roses?", 1
Morrel, 1
smiled., 1
"As, 1
you, 1
please,", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"death, 1
is, 1
always, 1
death,--that, 1
is, 1
forgetfulness,, 1
repose,, 1
exclusion, 1
from, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
from, 1
grief.", 1
He, 1
sat, 1
down,, 1
and, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
placed, 1
himself, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
him., 1
They, 1
were, 1
in, 1
the, 1
marvellous, 1
dining-room, 1
before, 1
described,, 1
where, 1
the, 1
statues, 1
had, 1
baskets, 1
on, 1
their, 1
heads, 1
always, 1
filled, 1
with, 1
fruits, 1
and, 1
flowers., 1
Morrel, 1
had, 1
looked, 1
carelessly, 1
around,, 1
and, 1
had, 1
probably, 1
noticed, 1
nothing., 1
"Let, 1
us, 1
talk, 1
like, 1
men,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count., 1
"Go, 1
on!", 1
"Count,", 1
said, 1
Morrel,, 1
"you, 1
are, 1
the, 1
epitome, 1
of, 1
all, 1
human, 1
knowledge,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
seem, 1
like, 1
a, 1
being, 1
descended, 1
from, 1
a, 1
wiser, 1
and, 1
more, 1
advanced, 1
world, 1
than, 1
ours.", 1
"There, 1
is, 1
something, 1
true, 1
in, 1
what, 1
you, 1
say,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
with, 1
that, 1
smile, 1
which, 1
made, 1
him, 1
so, 1
handsome;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
descended, 1
from, 1
a, 1
planet, 1
called, 1
grief.", 1
"I, 1
believe, 1
all, 1
you, 1
tell, 1
me, 1
without, 1
questioning, 1
its, 1
meaning;, 1
for, 1
instance,, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
to, 1
live,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
did, 1
live;, 1
you, 1
told, 1
me, 1
to, 1
hope,, 1
and, 1
I, 1
almost, 1
did, 1
so., 1
I, 1
am, 1
almost, 1
inclined, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
you,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
you, 1
had, 1
experienced, 1
death,, 1
'is, 1
it, 1
painful, 1
to, 1
die?'", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
looked, 1
upon, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
indescribable, 1
tenderness., 1
"Yes,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"yes,, 1
doubtless, 1
it, 1
is, 1
painful,, 1
if, 1
you, 1
violently, 1
break, 1
the, 1
outer, 1
covering, 1
which, 1
obstinately, 1
begs, 1
for, 1
life., 1
If, 1
you, 1
plunge, 1
a, 1
dagger, 1
into, 1
your, 1
flesh,, 1

you, 1
insinuate, 1
a, 1
bullet, 1
into, 1
your, 1
brain,, 1

the, 1
least, 1
shock, 1
disorders,--then, 1
certainly,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
suffer, 1
pain,, 1
and, 1
you, 1
will, 1
repent, 1
quitting, 1
a, 1
life, 1
for, 1
a, 1
repose, 1
you, 1
have, 1
bought, 1
at, 1
so, 1
dear, 1
a, 1
price.", 1
"Yes;, 1
I, 1
know, 1
that, 1
there, 1
is, 1
a, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
luxury, 1

pain, 1
in, 1
death,, 1

well, 1
as, 1
in, 1

the, 1
only, 1
thing, 1
is, 1
to, 1
understand, 1
it.", 1
"You, 1
have, 1
spoken, 1
truly,, 1
Maximilian;, 1
according, 1
to, 1
the, 1
care, 1
we, 1
bestow, 1
upon, 1
it,, 1

either, 1
a, 1
friend, 1
who, 1
rocks, 1
us, 1
gently, 1
as, 1
a, 1
nurse,, 1
or, 1
an, 1
enemy, 1
who, 1
violently, 1
drags, 1
the, 1
soul, 1
from, 1
the, 1
body., 1
Some, 1
day,, 1
when, 1
the, 1
world, 1
is, 1
much, 1
older,, 1

when, 1
mankind, 1
will, 1
be, 1
masters, 1
of, 1
all, 1
the, 1
destructive, 1
powers, 1
in, 1

to, 1
serve, 1
for, 1

general, 1
good, 1
of, 1
humanity;, 1

you, 1
were, 1
just, 1
saying,, 1
have, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
secrets, 1
of, 1
death,, 1

that, 1
death, 1
will, 1
become, 1
as, 1
sweet, 1
and, 1
voluptuous, 1
as, 1
a, 1
slumber, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arms, 1
of, 1
your, 1
beloved.", 1
"And, 1
if, 1
you, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
choose, 1
this, 1
death,, 1
count?", 1
"Yes.", 1
Morrel, 1
extended, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Now, 1
I, 1
understand,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"why, 1
you, 1
had, 1
me, 1
brought, 1
here, 1

It, 1
was, 1

loved, 1

enough, 1

were, 1

without, 1

death, 1

allows, 1
me, 1
to, 1
fade, 1
away, 1

Valentine's, 1

pressing, 1
your, 1

"Yes,, 1
you, 1
have, 1
guessed, 1
rightly,, 1

is, 1

intended.", 1
"Thanks;, 1
the, 1
idea, 1
that, 1
tomorrow, 1

sweet, 1
to, 1
my, 1
heart.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
then, 1
regret, 1
nothing?", 1
"No,", 1
replied, 1
Morrel., 1
"Not, 1
even, 1
me?", 1
asked, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
deep, 1
emotion., 1
Morrel's, 1
clear, 1
eye, 1
was, 1
for, 1
the, 1
moment, 1
clouded,, 1
then, 1
it, 1
shone, 1
with, 1
unusual, 1
lustre,, 1
and, 1
a, 1
large, 1
tear, 1
rolled, 1
down, 1
his, 1
cheek., 1
"What,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
still, 1
regret, 1
anything, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world,, 1
and, 1
yet, 1
die?", 1
"Oh,, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
you,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Morrel, 1
in, 1
a, 1
low, 1
voice,, 1
"do, 1
not, 1
speak, 1
another, 1
word,, 1
count;, 1
do, 1
not, 1
prolong, 1
my, 1
punishment.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
fancied, 1
that, 1
he, 1
was, 1
yielding,, 1
and, 1
this, 1
belief, 1
revived, 1
the, 1
horrible, 1
doubt, 1
that, 1
had, 1
overwhelmed, 1
him, 1
at, 1
the, 1
Chateau, 1
d'If., 1
"I, 1
am, 1
endeavoring,", 1
he, 1
thought,, 1
"to, 1
make, 1
this, 1
man, 1
happy;, 1
I, 1
look, 1
upon, 1
this, 1
restitution, 1
as, 1
a, 1
weight, 1
thrown, 1
into, 1
the, 1
scale, 1

evil, 1

of, 1
me, 1

can, 1
only, 1
atone, 1
for, 1
evil, 1
by, 1
doing, 1
good?", 1

he, 1
said, 1
aloud:, 1
"Listen,, 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
see, 1
your, 1
grief, 1
is, 1
great,, 1

still, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
like, 1
to, 1

your, 1
soul.", 1
Morrel, 1
smiled, 1
sadly., 1
"Count,", 1

"What, 1
do, 1
you, 1
mean?", 1
"I, 1
mean,, 1
that, 1
you, 1

live.", 1
"Count,, 1
I, 1
have, 1
your, 1
word,", 1
said, 1
Morrel, 1
coldly;, 1
then, 1
taking, 1
out, 1
his, 1
watch,, 1
he, 1
added,, 1
"It, 1
is, 1
half-past, 1
eleven.", 1
"Morrel,, 1

Maximilian,, 1
"or, 1
I, 1
shall, 1
think, 1
you, 1
did, 1
not, 1
love, 1
me, 1
for, 1
my, 1

sake,, 1

for, 1
yours;", 1
and, 1
he, 1
arose., 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
whose, 1
countenance, 1
brightened, 1
at, 1
these, 1
words;, 1
"you, 1
wish--you, 1
are, 1
inflexible., 1
Yes,, 1
as, 1
you, 1
said,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
indeed, 1
wretched, 1
and, 1
a, 1
miracle, 1
alone, 1
can, 1
cure, 1
you., 1
Sit, 1
down,, 1
Morrel,, 1
and, 1
wait.", 1
Morrel, 1
obeyed;, 1
the, 1
count, 1
arose,, 1
and, 1
unlocking, 1
a, 1
closet, 1
with, 1
a, 1
key, 1
suspended, 1
from, 1
his, 1
gold, 1
chain,, 1
took, 1
from, 1
it, 1
a, 1
little, 1
silver, 1
casket,, 1
beautifully, 1
carved, 1
and, 1
chased,, 1
the, 1
corners, 1
of, 1
which, 1
represented, 1
four, 1
bending, 1
figures,, 1
similar, 1
to, 1
the, 1
Caryatides,, 1
the, 1
forms, 1
of, 1
women,, 1
symbols, 1
of, 1
the, 1
angels, 1
aspiring, 1
to, 1
heaven., 1
He, 1
placed, 1
the, 1
casket, 1
on, 1
the, 1
table;, 1
then, 1
opening, 1
it, 1
took, 1
out, 1
a, 1
little, 1
golden, 1
box,, 1
the, 1
top, 1
of, 1
which, 1
flew, 1
open, 1
when, 1
touched, 1
by, 1
a, 1
secret, 1
spring., 1
This, 1
box, 1
contained, 1
an, 1
unctuous, 1
substance, 1
partly, 1
solid,, 1
of, 1
which, 1
it, 1
was, 1
impossible, 1
to, 1
discover, 1
the, 1
color,, 1
owing, 1
to, 1
the, 1
reflection, 1
of, 1
the, 1
polished, 1
gold,, 1
sapphires,, 1
rubies,, 1
emeralds,, 1
which, 1
ornamented, 1
the, 1
box., 1
It, 1
was, 1
a, 1
mixed, 1
mass, 1
of, 1
blue,, 1
red,, 1
and, 1
gold., 1
The, 1
count, 1
took, 1
out, 1
a, 1
small, 1
quantity, 1
of, 1
this, 1
with, 1
a, 1
gilt, 1
spoon,, 1
and, 1
offered, 1
it, 1
to, 1
Morrel,, 1
fixing, 1
a, 1
long, 1
steadfast, 1
glance, 1
upon, 1
him., 1
It, 1
was, 1
then, 1
observable, 1
that, 1
the, 1
substance, 1
was, 1
greenish., 1
"This, 1
is, 1
what, 1
you, 1
asked, 1
for,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"and, 1
what, 1
I, 1
promised, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you.", 1
"I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
from, 1
the, 1
depths, 1
of, 1
my, 1
heart,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
taking, 1
the, 1
spoon, 1
from, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
The, 1
count, 1
took, 1
another, 1
spoon,, 1
and, 1
again, 1
dipped, 1
it, 1
into, 1
the, 1
golden, 1
box., 1
"What, 1
are, 1
you, 1
going, 1
to, 1
do,, 1
my, 1
friend?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel,, 1
arresting, 1
his, 1
hand., 1
"Well,, 1
the, 1
fact, 1
is,, 1
Morrel,, 1
I, 1
was, 1
thinking, 1
that, 1
I, 1
too, 1
am, 1
weary, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
and, 1
since, 1
an, 1
opportunity, 1
presents, 1
itself"--, 1
"Stay!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man., 1
"You, 1
who, 1
love,, 1
and, 1
are, 1
beloved;, 1
you,, 1
who, 1
have, 1
faith, 1
and, 1
hope,--oh,, 1
do, 1
not, 1
follow, 1
my, 1
example., 1
In, 1
your, 1
case, 1
it, 1
would, 1
be, 1
a, 1
crime., 1
Adieu,, 1
my, 1
noble, 1
and, 1
generous, 1
friend,, 1
adieu;, 1
I, 1
will, 1
go, 1
and, 1
tell, 1
Valentine, 1
what, 1
you, 1
have, 1
done, 1
for, 1
me.", 1
And, 1
slowly,, 1
though, 1
without, 1
any, 1
hesitation,, 1
only, 1
waiting, 1
to, 1
press, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand, 1
fervently,, 1
he, 1
swallowed, 1
the, 1
mysterious, 1
substance, 1
offered, 1
by, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo., 1
Then, 1
they, 1
were, 1
both, 1
silent., 1
Ali,, 1
mute, 1
and, 1
attentive,, 1
brought, 1
the, 1
pipes, 1
and, 1
coffee,, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
By, 1
degrees,, 1
the, 1
light, 1
of, 1
the, 1
lamps, 1
gradually, 1
faded, 1
in, 1
the, 1
hands, 1
of, 1
the, 1
marble, 1
statues, 1
which, 1
held, 1
them,, 1
and, 1
the, 1
perfumes, 1
appeared, 1
less, 1
powerful, 1
to, 1
Morrel., 1
Seated, 1
opposite, 1
to, 1
him,, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
watched, 1
him, 1
in, 1
the, 1
shadow,, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
saw, 1
nothing, 1
but, 1
the, 1
bright, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
the, 1
count., 1
An, 1
overpowering, 1
sadness, 1
took, 1
possession, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man,, 1
his, 1
hands, 1
relaxed, 1
their, 1
hold,, 1
the, 1
objects, 1
in, 1
the, 1
room, 1
gradually, 1
lost, 1
their, 1
form, 1
and, 1
color,, 1
and, 1
his, 1
disturbed, 1
vision, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
perceive, 1
doors, 1
and, 1
curtains, 1
open, 1
in, 1
the, 1
walls., 1
"Friend,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
"I, 1
feel, 1
that, 1
I, 1
am, 1
dying;, 1
thanks!", 1
He, 1
made, 1
a, 1
last, 1
effort, 1
to, 1
extend, 1
his, 1
hand,, 1
but, 1
it, 1
fell, 1
powerless, 1
beside, 1
him., 1
Then, 1
it, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
him, 1
that, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
smiled,, 1
not, 1
with, 1
the, 1
strange, 1
and, 1
fearful, 1
expression, 1
which, 1
had, 1
sometimes, 1
revealed, 1
to, 1
him, 1
the, 1
secrets, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart,, 1
but, 1
with, 1
the, 1
benevolent, 1
kindness, 1
of, 1
a, 1
father, 1
for, 1
a, 1
child., 1
At, 1
the, 1
same, 1
time, 1
the, 1
count, 1
appeared, 1
to, 1
increase, 1
in, 1
stature,, 1
his, 1
form,, 1
nearly, 1
double, 1
its, 1
usual, 1
height,, 1
stood, 1
out, 1
in, 1
relief, 1
against, 1
the, 1
red, 1
tapestry,, 1
his, 1
black, 1
hair, 1
was, 1
thrown, 1
back,, 1
and, 1
he, 1
stood, 1
in, 1
the, 1
attitude, 1
of, 1
an, 1
avenging, 1
angel., 1
Morrel,, 1
overpowered,, 1
turned, 1
around, 1
in, 1
the, 1
arm-chair;, 1
a, 1
delicious, 1
torpor, 1
permeated, 1
every, 1
vein., 1
A, 1
change, 1
of, 1
ideas, 1
presented, 1
themselves, 1
to, 1
his, 1
brain,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
new, 1
design, 1
on, 1
the, 1
kaleidoscope., 1
Enervated,, 1
prostrate,, 1
and, 1
breathless,, 1
he, 1
became, 1
unconscious, 1
of, 1
outward, 1
objects;, 1
he, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
be, 1
entering, 1
that, 1
vague, 1
delirium, 1
preceding, 1
death., 1
He, 1
wished, 1
once, 1
again, 1
to, 1
press, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
own, 1
was, 1
immovable., 1
He, 1
wished, 1
to, 1
articulate, 1
a, 1
last, 1
farewell,, 1
but, 1
his, 1
tongue, 1
lay, 1
motionless, 1
and, 1
heavy, 1
in, 1
his, 1
throat,, 1
like, 1
a, 1
stone, 1
at, 1
the, 1
mouth, 1
of, 1
a, 1
sepulchre., 1
Involuntarily, 1
his, 1
languid, 1
eyes, 1
closed,, 1
and, 1
still, 1
through, 1
his, 1
eyelashes, 1
a, 1
well-known, 1
form, 1
seemed, 1
to, 1
move, 1
amid, 1
the, 1
obscurity, 1
with, 1
which, 1
he, 1
thought, 1
himself, 1
enveloped., 1
The, 1
count, 1
had, 1
just, 1
opened, 1
a, 1
door., 1
Immediately, 1
a, 1
brilliant, 1
light, 1
from, 1
the, 1
next, 1
room,, 1
or, 1
rather, 1
from, 1
the, 1
palace, 1
adjoining,, 1
shone, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
room, 1
in, 1
which, 1
he, 1
was, 1
gently, 1
gliding, 1
into, 1
his, 1
last, 1
sleep., 1
Then, 1
he, 1
saw, 1
a, 1
woman, 1
of, 1
marvellous, 1
beauty, 1
appear, 1
on, 1
the, 1
threshold, 1
of, 1
the, 1
door, 1
separating, 1
the, 1
two, 1
rooms., 1
Pale,, 1
and, 1
sweetly, 1
smiling,, 1
she, 1
looked, 1
like, 1
an, 1
angel, 1
of, 1
mercy, 1
conjuring, 1
the, 1
angel, 1
of, 1
vengeance., 1
"Is, 1
it, 1
heaven, 1
that, 1
opens, 1
before, 1
me?", 1
thought, 1
the, 1
dying, 1
man;, 1
"that, 1
angel, 1
resembles, 1
the, 1
one, 1
I, 1
have, 1
lost.", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
pointed, 1
out, 1
Morrel, 1
to, 1
the, 1
young, 1
woman,, 1
who, 1
advanced, 1
towards, 1
him, 1
with, 1
clasped, 1
hands, 1
and, 1
a, 1
smile, 1
upon, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
"Valentine,, 1
Valentine!", 1
he, 1
mentally, 1
ejaculated;, 1
but, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
uttered, 1
no, 1
sound,, 1
and, 1
as, 1
though, 1
all, 1
his, 1
strength, 1
were, 1
centred, 1
in, 1
that, 1
internal, 1
emotion,, 1
he, 1
sighed, 1
and, 1
closed, 1
his, 1
eyes., 1
Valentine, 1
rushed, 1
towards, 1
him;, 1
his, 1
lips, 1
again, 1
moved., 1
"He, 1
is, 1
calling, 1
you,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"he, 1
to, 1
whom, 1
you, 1
have, 1
confided, 1
your, 1
destiny--he, 1
from, 1
whom, 1
death, 1
would, 1
have, 1
separated, 1
you,, 1
calls, 1
you, 1
to, 1
him., 1
Happily,, 1
I, 1
vanquished, 1
death., 1
Henceforth,, 1
Valentine,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
never, 1
again, 1
be, 1
separated, 1
on, 1
earth,, 1
since, 1
he, 1
has, 1
rushed, 1
into, 1
death, 1
to, 1
find, 1
you., 1
Without, 1
me,, 1
you, 1
would, 1
both, 1
have, 1
died., 1
May, 1
God, 1
accept, 1
my, 1
atonement, 1
in, 1
the, 1
preservation, 1
of, 1
these, 1
two, 1
existences!", 1
Valentine, 1
seized, 1
the, 1
count's, 1
hand,, 1
and, 1
in, 1
her, 1
irresistible, 1
impulse, 1
of, 1
joy, 1
carried, 1
it, 1
to, 1
her, 1
lips., 1
"Oh,, 1
thank, 1
me, 1
again!", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"tell, 1
me, 1
till, 1
you, 1
are, 1
weary,, 1
that, 1
I, 1
have, 1
restored, 1
you, 1
to, 1
happiness;, 1
you, 1
do, 1
not, 1
know, 1
how, 1
much, 1
I, 1
require, 1
this, 1
assurance.", 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
yes,, 1
I, 1
thank, 1
you, 1
with, 1
all, 1
my, 1
heart,", 1
said, 1
Valentine;, 1
"and, 1
if, 1
you, 1
doubt, 1
the, 1
sincerity, 1
of, 1
my, 1
gratitude,, 1

ask, 1
Haidee!, 1
ask, 1
my, 1
beloved, 1
sister, 1
Haidee,, 1
who, 1
ever, 1
since, 1
our, 1
departure, 1
from, 1
France,, 1
has, 1
caused, 1
me, 1
to, 1
wait, 1
patiently, 1
for, 1
this, 1
happy, 1
day,, 1
while, 1
talking, 1
to, 1
me, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"You, 1
then, 1
love, 1
Haidee?", 1
asked, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
with, 1
an, 1
emotion, 1
he, 1
in, 1
vain, 1
endeavored, 1
to, 1
dissimulate., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,, 1
with, 1
all, 1
my, 1
soul.", 1
"Well,, 1
then,, 1
listen,, 1
Valentine,", 1
said, 1
the, 1
count;, 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
favor, 1
to, 1
ask, 1
of, 1
you.", 1
"Of, 1
me?, 1
Oh,, 1
am, 1
I, 1
happy, 1
enough, 1
for, 1
that?", 1
"Yes;, 1
you, 1
have, 1
called, 1
Haidee, 1
your, 1
sister,--let, 1
her, 1
become, 1
so, 1
indeed,, 1
Valentine;, 1
render, 1
her, 1
all, 1
the, 1
gratitude, 1
you, 1
fancy, 1
that, 1

owe, 1
to, 1
me;, 1
protect, 1
her,, 1
for", 1
(the, 1
count's, 1
voice, 1
was, 1
thick, 1
with, 1
emotion), 1
"henceforth, 1
she, 1
will, 1
be, 1
alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world.", 1
"Alone, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world!", 1
repeated, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
behind, 1
the, 1
count,, 1
"and, 1
why?", 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
turned, 1
around;, 1
Haidee, 1
was, 1
standing, 1
pale,, 1
motionless,, 1
looking, 1
at, 1
the, 1
count, 1
with, 1
an, 1
expression, 1
of, 1
fearful, 1
amazement., 1
"Because, 1
to-morrow,, 1
Haidee,, 1
you, 1
will, 1
be, 1
free;, 1
you, 1
will, 1
then, 1
assume, 1
your, 1
proper, 1
position, 1
in, 1
society,, 1

will, 1
not, 1
allow, 1
my, 1
destiny, 1
to, 1
overshadow, 1
yours., 1
Daughter, 1
of, 1
a, 1
prince,, 1
I, 1
restore, 1
to, 1
you, 1
the, 1
riches, 1
and, 1
name, 1
of, 1
your, 1
father.", 1
Haidee, 1
became, 1
pale,, 1
and, 1
lifting, 1
her, 1
transparent, 1
hands, 1
to, 1
heaven,, 1
exclaimed, 1
in, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
stifled, 1
with, 1
tears,, 1
"Then, 1
you, 1
leave, 1
me,, 1
my, 1
lord?", 1
"Haidee,, 1
Haidee,, 1
you, 1
are, 1
young, 1
and, 1
beautiful;, 1
forget, 1
even, 1
my, 1
name,, 1

be, 1
happy.", 1
"It, 1
is, 1
well,", 1
said, 1
Haidee;, 1
"your, 1
order, 1
shall, 1
be, 1
executed,, 1
my, 1

I, 1
will, 1
forget, 1
even, 1
your, 1
name,, 1

be, 1
happy.", 1
And, 1
she, 1
stepped, 1
back, 1
to, 1
retire., 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Valentine,, 1
who, 1
was, 1
supporting, 1
the, 1
head, 1
of, 1
Morrel, 1
on, 1
her, 1
shoulder,, 1
"do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
how, 1
pale, 1
she, 1
is?, 1
Do, 1
you, 1
not, 1
see, 1
how, 1
she, 1
suffers?", 1
Haidee, 1
answered, 1
with, 1
a, 1
heartrending, 1
expression,, 1
"Why, 1
should, 1
he, 1
understand, 1
this,, 1
my, 1
sister?, 1
He, 1
is, 1
my, 1
master,, 1

I, 1

his, 1
slave;, 1
he, 1
has, 1
the, 1
right, 1
to, 1
notice, 1
nothing.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
shuddered, 1
at, 1
the, 1
tones, 1
of, 1
a, 1
voice, 1
which, 1
penetrated, 1
the, 1
inmost, 1
recesses, 1
of, 1
his, 1
heart;, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
met, 1
those, 1
of, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl, 1
and, 1
he, 1
could, 1
not, 1
bear, 1
their, 1
brilliancy., 1
"Oh,, 1
heavens,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo,, 1
"can, 1
my, 1
suspicions, 1
be, 1
correct?, 1
Haidee,, 1
would, 1
it, 1
please, 1
you, 1
not, 1
to, 1
leave, 1
me?", 1
"I, 1
am, 1
young,", 1
gently, 1
replied, 1
Haidee;, 1
"I, 1
love, 1
the, 1
life, 1

have, 1
made, 1
so, 1
sweet, 1
to, 1

"You, 1

that, 1

leave, 1
you,, 1

should, 1
die;, 1
yes,, 1
my, 1
lord.", 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
then, 1
love, 1
me?", 1
"Oh,, 1
Valentine,, 1
he, 1
asks, 1
if, 1
I, 1
love, 1
him., 1
Valentine,, 1
tell, 1
him, 1
if, 1
you, 1
love, 1
Maximilian.", 1
The, 1
count, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
dilate, 1
and, 1
throb;, 1
he, 1
opened, 1
his, 1
arms,, 1
and, 1
Haidee,, 1
uttering, 1
a, 1
cry,, 1
sprang, 1
into, 1
them., 1
"Oh,, 1
yes,", 1
she, 1
cried,, 1
"I, 1
do, 1
love, 1
you!, 1
I, 1
love, 1
you, 1
as, 1
one, 1
loves, 1

"Let, 1
it, 1
be,, 1
then,, 1
as, 1
you, 1

angel;, 1
God, 1
has, 1
sustained, 1
me, 1
in, 1
my, 1
struggle, 1
with, 1
my, 1
enemies,, 1

has, 1

he, 1
has, 1
pardoned, 1
me., 1
Love, 1
me, 1
then,, 1
Haidee!, 1
Who, 1
knows?, 1
perhaps, 1
your, 1

will, 1
make, 1
me, 1

mean,, 1
my, 1

"I, 1
mean, 1
that, 1
one, 1
word, 1
from, 1
you, 1
has, 1
enlightened, 1
me, 1
more, 1
than, 1
twenty, 1
years, 1

I, 1

"Do, 1
you, 1
hear, 1
him,, 1
Valentine?", 1
exclaimed, 1
Haidee;, 1
"he, 1
says, 1
that, 1
through, 1
me, 1

me,, 1

The, 1
count, 1
withdrew, 1
for, 1
a, 1
moment., 1
"Have, 1
I, 1
discovered, 1
the, 1
truth?", 1
he, 1
said;, 1
"but, 1
whether, 1
it, 1

Come,, 1
Haidee,, 1
come!", 1
and, 1
throwing, 1
his, 1
arm, 1
around, 1
the, 1
young, 1
girl's, 1
waist,, 1
he, 1
pressed, 1
the, 1
hand, 1
of, 1
Valentine,, 1
and, 1
disappeared., 1
An, 1
hour, 1
had, 1
nearly, 1
passed,, 1
during, 1
which, 1
Valentine,, 1
breathless, 1
and, 1
motionless,, 1
watched, 1
steadfastly, 1
over, 1
Morrel., 1
At, 1
length, 1
she, 1
felt, 1
his, 1
heart, 1
beat,, 1
a, 1
faint, 1
breath, 1
played, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
lips,, 1
a, 1
slight, 1
shudder,, 1
announcing, 1
the, 1
return, 1
of, 1
life,, 1
passed, 1
through, 1
the, 1
young, 1
man's, 1
frame., 1
At, 1
length, 1
his, 1
eyes, 1
opened,, 1
but, 1
they, 1
were, 1
at, 1
first, 1
fixed, 1
and, 1
expressionless;, 1
then, 1
sight, 1
returned,, 1
and, 1
with, 1
it, 1
feeling, 1
and, 1
grief., 1
"Oh,", 1
he, 1
cried,, 1
in, 1
an, 1
accent, 1
of, 1
despair,, 1
"the, 1
count, 1
has, 1
deceived, 1
me;, 1
I, 1
am, 1
yet, 1
living;", 1
and, 1
extending, 1
his, 1
hand, 1
towards, 1
the, 1
table,, 1
he, 1
seized, 1
a, 1
knife., 1
"Dearest,", 1
exclaimed, 1
Valentine,, 1
with, 1
her, 1
adorable, 1
smile,, 1
"awake,, 1
and, 1
look, 1
at, 1
me!", 1
Morrel, 1
uttered, 1
a, 1
loud, 1
exclamation,, 1
and, 1
frantic,, 1
doubtful,, 1
dazzled,, 1
as, 1
though, 1
by, 1
a, 1
celestial, 1
vision,, 1
he, 1
fell, 1
upon, 1
his, 1
knees., 1
The, 1
next, 1
morning, 1
at, 1
daybreak,, 1
Valentine, 1
and, 1
Morrel, 1
were, 1
walking, 1
arm-in-arm, 1
on, 1
the, 1
sea-shore,, 1
Valentine, 1
relating, 1
how, 1
Monte, 1
Cristo, 1
had, 1
appeared, 1
in, 1
her, 1
room,, 1
explained, 1
everything,, 1
revealed, 1
the, 1
crime,, 1
and,, 1
finally,, 1
how, 1
he, 1
had, 1
saved, 1
her, 1
life, 1
by, 1
enabling, 1
her, 1
to, 1
simulate, 1
death., 1
They, 1
had, 1
found, 1
the, 1
door, 1
of, 1
the, 1
grotto, 1
opened,, 1
and, 1
gone, 1
forth;, 1
on, 1
the, 1
azure, 1
dome, 1
of, 1
heaven, 1
still, 1
glittered, 1
a, 1
few, 1
remaining, 1
stars., 1
Morrel, 1
soon, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
man, 1
standing, 1
among, 1
the, 1
rocks,, 1
apparently, 1
awaiting, 1
a, 1
sign, 1
from, 1
them, 1
to, 1
advance,, 1
and, 1
pointed, 1
him, 1
out, 1
to, 1
Valentine., 1
"Ah,, 1
it, 1
is, 1
Jacopo,", 1
she, 1
said,, 1
"the, 1
captain, 1
of, 1
the, 1
yacht;", 1
and, 1
she, 1
beckoned, 1
him, 1
towards, 1
them., 1
"Do, 1
you, 1
wish, 1
to, 1
speak, 1
to, 1
us?", 1
asked, 1
Morrel., 1
"I, 1
have, 1
a, 1
letter, 1
to, 1
give, 1
you, 1
from, 1
the, 1
count.", 1
"From, 1
the, 1
count!", 1
murmured, 1
the, 1
two, 1
young, 1
people., 1
"Yes;, 1
read, 1
it.", 1
Morrel, 1
opened, 1
the, 1
letter,, 1
and, 1
read:--, 1
"My, 1
Dear, 1
Maximilian,--, 1
"There, 1
is, 1
a, 1
felucca, 1
for, 1
you, 1
at, 1
anchor., 1
Jacopo, 1
will, 1
carry, 1
you, 1
to, 1
Leghorn,, 1
where, 1
Monsieur, 1
Noirtier, 1
awaits, 1
his, 1
granddaughter,, 1
whom, 1
he, 1
wishes, 1
to, 1
bless, 1
before, 1
you, 1
lead, 1
her, 1
to, 1
the, 1
altar., 1
All, 1
that, 1
is, 1
in, 1
this, 1
grotto,, 1
my, 1
friend,, 1
my, 1
house, 1
in, 1
the, 1
Champs, 1
Elysees,, 1
and, 1
my, 1
chateau, 1
at, 1
Treport,, 1
are, 1
the, 1
marriage, 1
gifts, 1
bestowed, 1
by, 1
Edmond, 1
Dantes, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
son, 1
of, 1
his, 1
old, 1
master,, 1
Morrel., 1
Mademoiselle, 1
de, 1
Villefort, 1
will, 1
share, 1
them, 1
with, 1
you;, 1
for, 1
I, 1
entreat, 1
her, 1
to, 1
give, 1
to, 1
the, 1
poor, 1
the, 1
immense, 1
fortune, 1
reverting, 1
to, 1
her, 1
from, 1
her, 1
father,, 1
now, 1
a, 1
madman,, 1
and, 1
her, 1
brother, 1
who, 1
died, 1
last, 1
September, 1
with, 1
his, 1
mother., 1
Tell, 1
the, 1
angel, 1
who, 1
will, 1
watch, 1
over, 1
your, 1
future, 1
destiny,, 1
Morrel,, 1
to, 1
pray, 1
sometimes, 1
for, 1
a, 1
man,, 1
who, 1
like, 1
Satan, 1
thought, 1
himself, 1
for, 1
an, 1
instant, 1
equal, 1
to, 1
God,, 1
but, 1
who, 1
now, 1
acknowledges, 1
with, 1
Christian, 1
humility, 1
that, 1
God, 1
alone, 1
possesses, 1
supreme, 1
power, 1
and, 1
infinite, 1
wisdom., 1
Perhaps, 1
those, 1
prayers, 1
may, 1
soften, 1
the, 1
remorse, 1
he, 1
feels, 1
in, 1
his, 1
heart., 1
As, 1
for, 1
you,, 1
Morrel,, 1
this, 1
is, 1
the, 1
secret, 1
of, 1
my, 1
conduct, 1
towards, 1
you., 1
There, 1
is, 1
neither, 1
happiness, 1
nor, 1
misery, 1
in, 1
the, 1
world;, 1
there, 1
is, 1
only, 1
the, 1
comparison, 1
of, 1
one, 1
state, 1
with, 1
another,, 1
nothing, 1
more., 1
He, 1
who, 1
has, 1
felt, 1
the, 1
deepest, 1
grief, 1
is, 1
best, 1
able, 1
to, 1
experience, 1
supreme, 1
happiness., 1
We, 1
must, 1
have, 1
felt, 1
what, 1
it, 1
is, 1
to, 1
die,, 1
Morrel,, 1
that, 1
we, 1
may, 1
appreciate, 1
the, 1
enjoyments, 1
of, 1
living., 1
"Live,, 1
then,, 1
and, 1
be, 1
happy,, 1
beloved, 1
children, 1
of, 1
my, 1
heart,, 1
and, 1
never, 1

that, 1

the, 1
day, 1
when, 1
God, 1

During, 1
the, 1
perusal, 1
of, 1
this, 1
letter,, 1
which, 1
informed, 1
Valentine, 1
for, 1
the, 1
first, 1
time, 1
of, 1
the, 1
madness, 1
of, 1
her, 1
father, 1
and, 1
the, 1
death, 1
of, 1
her, 1
brother,, 1
she, 1
became, 1
pale,, 1
a, 1
heavy, 1
sigh, 1
escaped, 1
from, 1
her, 1
bosom,, 1
and, 1
tears,, 1
not, 1
the, 1
less, 1
painful, 1
because, 1
they, 1
were, 1
silent,, 1
ran, 1
down, 1
her, 1
cheeks;, 1
her, 1
happiness, 1
cost, 1
her, 1
very, 1
dear., 1
Morrel, 1
looked, 1
around, 1
uneasily., 1
"But,", 1
he, 1
said,, 1
"the, 1
count's, 1
generosity, 1
is, 1
too, 1
overwhelming;, 1
Valentine, 1

"What, 1

you, 1

asked, 1
Valentine., 1
"Where, 1
is, 1
the, 1

is, 1
Haidee?", 1
"Look!", 1
said, 1
Jacopo., 1
The, 1
eyes, 1
of, 1
both, 1
were, 1
fixed, 1
upon, 1
the, 1
spot, 1
indicated, 1
by, 1

and, 1
on, 1
the, 1
blue, 1

separating, 1
the, 1

from, 1
the, 1
Mediterranean, 1

they, 1
perceived, 1
a, 1
large, 1
white, 1

"Gone,", 1
said, 1
Morrel;, 1
"gone!--adieu,, 1
my, 1

"Gone,", 1
murmured, 1
Valentine;, 1
"adieu,, 1

"Who, 1

said, 1
Morrel, 1
with, 1
tearful, 1
eyes., 1
"Darling,", 1
replied, 1
Valentine,, 1
"has, 1
