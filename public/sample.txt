Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm 
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared 
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project 
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 
 
 
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed 
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. 
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily 
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
